To the Stockholders and Board of Directors IXYS Corporation
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity deficit, and
cash flows, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of IXYS Corporation and its subsidiaries at March 31, 1999 and 1998, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended March 31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. FORMATION AND BUSINESS OF IXYS  Effective September 23, 1998, IXYS Corporation IXYS merged with Paradigm
Technology, Inc. Paradigm, a company that designs and markets fast SRAM
products, in a transaction accounted for as a reverse merger. In the merger,
Paradigm issued 11,513,821 shares of its common stock in exchange for all
outstanding shares of IXYS capital stock. At the conclusion of the merger,
IXYS stockholders held approximately 96% of the combined company. After the
merger, the historic accounting records of IXYS became those of the combined
company and, accordingly, Paradigm changed its name to IXYS the combined
company of which is referred to in this filing as the Company or the
Registrant.
IXYS Corporation designs, develops and markets power semiconductors, Digital
and Analog Integrated Circuits IC, and high speed, high density Static
Random Access Memory SRAM. Power semiconductors are used primarily in
controlling energy in motor drives, power conversion including
uninterruptible power supplies UPS and switch mode power supplies SMPS
and medical electronics. IXYS' power semiconductors convert electricity at
relatively high voltage and current levels to create efficient power as
required by a specific application. IXYS' target market includes segments of
the power semiconductor market that require medium to high power
semiconductors, with a particular emphasis on higher power semiconductors.
IXYS sells power semiconductors, including power MOSFETs, insulated gate
bipolar transistors IGBTs, thyristors silicon controlled rectifiers or
SCRs and rectifiers, including fast recovery epitaxial diodes FREDs. SRAM
products are for uses in telecommunication devices, workstations and high
performance PCs to OEMs and distributors in the United States, Europe and the
Far East.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of all significant
intercompany balances and transactions.
Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from IXYS' estimates.
Foreign Currency Translation  The local currency is considered to be the functional currency of the
Company wholly owned subsidiary IXYS Semiconductor GmbH IXYS GmbH.
Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in
effect at year-end and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates
during the year. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the accounts of
IXYS GmbH into U.S. dollars are included in cumulative translation adjustment,
a separate component of stockholders' deficit. Foreign currency transaction
gains and losses are included as a component of other income and expense.
Cash Equivalents  IXYS considers all highly liquid investments with original or remaining
maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash
equivalents.
37                IXYS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Inventories  Inventories, consisting primarily of bipolar devices, transistors, diodes
and integrated circuits, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined on a standard cost basis which approximates actual costs determined
on a first-in, first-out FIFO method.
Plant and Equipment  Plant and equipment, including equipment under capital leases, is stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation or
amortization is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful
lives of three to five years for equipment and twenty years for buildings.
Upon disposal, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed
from IXYS' accounts and the resulting gains or losses are reflected in the
statements of income. The Company policy is to regularly review the carrying
value of specialized assets to evaluate the remaining life and recoverability
of such equipment in light of current market conditions.
Product Warranty  Expected future product warranty expense is recorded when the product is
sold.
Revenue Recognition  Revenue from power semiconductor product sales is recognized upon shipment
and is reflected net of an allowance for estimated returns and discounts. In
general, the Company sales to distributors are made under agreements
allowing certain rights of return and price protection on products unsold by
the distributors.
Advertising  IXYS expenses advertising as the costs are incurred. Advertising expense for
the years ended March 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999 was $268,000, $408,000, and
$413,000 respectively.
Research and Development  Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred.
Income Taxes  The Company provision for income taxes is comprised of its current tax
liability and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the
enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are
expected to reverse.
Other Assets--Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  Goodwill and other intangible assets arose from the Paradigm merger in the
amount of approximately $9,908,000. The company assesses the recoverability of
intangible assets by determining whether the amortization of the asset net
book value over its remaining life can be recovered through projected
undiscounted future cash flows. Accordingly, the company wrote off
approximately $1,463,000 of intangible assets and $7,752,000 of goodwill in
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999 to reflect an impairment in the value
of intangible assets and goodwill associated with the acquisition. The
anticipated cash flows related to the related products indicated that the
recoverability of those assets was not reasonably assured.
38                IXYS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Net Income Per Share  Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the
potential dilution from the exercise or conversion of other securities into
common stock.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information SFAS 131. SFAS 131 establishes standards
for the way that public business enterprises report information about
operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those
enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim
financial reports issued to stockholders. SFAS 131 generally supersedes
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No14, Financial Reporting for
Segments of Business Enterprise. Under SFAS 131, operating segments are
components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is
available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in
deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Generally,
financial information is required to be reported on the basis it is used
internally. SFAS 131 is effective for financial statements for periods
beginning after December 15, 1997, and restatement of comparative information
for earlier years is required. However, SFAS 131 is not required to be applied
to interim financial statements in the initial year of application. Based upon
the criteria of SFAS 131, the Company has a single operating segment.
Accordingly, the financial statements provided herein satisfy the standard for
reporting. Geographic information about revenues, operating income and
identifiable assets are provided in the notes to the financial statements.
In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133, or SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. SFAS 133 establishes new standards of accounting and reporting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires that all
derivatives be recognized at fair value in the balance sheet, and that the
corresponding gains or losses be reported either in the statement of
operations or as a component of comprehensive income, depending on the type of
hedging relationship that exists. SFAS 133 will be effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 1999. The Company does not currently hold derivative
instruments or engage in hedging activities.
In March 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee, or AcSEC,
released Statement of Position 98-1, or SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. SOP 98-1 requires
companies to capitalize certain costs of computer software developed or
obtained for internal use, provided that those costs are not research and
development. SOP 98-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 1998. The Company is evaluating the requirements of SOP 98-1 and the
effects, if any, on the Company current policies on accounting for software
costs.
Comprehensive Income  The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, or
SFAS 130, Accounting for Comprehensive Income, during the fiscal year ended
1998. This statement establishes standards for reporting and display of
comprehensive income and its components including revenues, expenses, gains
and losses in a full set of general-purpose financial statements. The
Company change in the cumulative translation adjustment represent the only
component of comprehensive income which is excluded from net income for 1999
and prior years. The Company comprehensive income has been presented in the
consolidated financial statements.
Business Risks  Dependence on Third Parties for Wafer Fabrication and Assembly: IXYS
manufactures approximately 53% of its wafers, an integral component of its
products, in its wholly owned facility in Germany. IXYS
39 purchases the remaining 47% of its wafers from other suppliers. There can be
no assurance that material disruptions in supply will not occur in the future.
In such event, IXYS may have to identify and secure additional foundry
capacity and may be unable to identify or secure additional foundry capacity
from another manufacturer, particularly at the levels that IXYS currently
anticipates such foundries to provide. Even if such capacity is available from
another manufacturer, the qualification process could take six months or
longer. If IXYS were unable to qualify alternative manufacturing sources for
existing or new products in a timely manner or if such sources were unable to
produce semiconductor devices with acceptable manufacturing yields and at
acceptable prices, IXYS' business, financial condition and results of
operations would be materially and adversely affected.
Dependence on Suppliers: IXYS purchases silicon wafers from three vendors
with whom IXYS does not have long term supply agreements. Any of these
suppliers could eliminate or terminate IXYS' supply of wafers at any time.
IXYS' reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several risks,
including potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of silicon wafers
and reduced control over the price, timely delivery, reliability and quality
of the silicon wafers. There can be no assurance that problems will not occur
in the future with suppliers.
Included in IXYS' consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 1999 are the net
assets, at book value, of IXYS' manufacturing operation in Germany, which
total approximately $567 million.
40                IXYS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Concentration of Credit Risk  IXYS invests its excess cash primarily in short-term time deposit accounts
with a major German bank and money market accounts with a U.S. bank. These
securities typically mature within ninety days and bear minimal credit risk.
IXYS has not experienced any losses on such investments.
IXYS sells its products primarily to distributors and original equipment
manufacturers in the United States and in Europe. IXYS performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral. An
allowance for potential credit losses is maintained by IXYS and such losses
have not been material.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments  Carrying amounts of certain of IXYS' financial instruments including cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other assets, accounts payable and
other accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short
maturities. Based on borrowing rates currently available to IXYS for loans
with similar terms, the carrying value of notes payable to bank and notes
receivable from shareholders approximate fair value.
The amounts reported for cash equivalents, receivables and other financial
instruments are considered to approximate fair values based upon comparable
market information available at the respective balance sheet dates. Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risks comprise principally cash, investments and trade accounts receivable.
The Company invests its excess cash in accordance with its investment policy
that has been approved by the Board of Directors and is reviewed periodically
to minimize credit risk. The policy authorizes the investment of excess cash
in government securities, tax exempt municipal securities, Eurodollar notes
and bonds, time deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper rated Aa
or better and other specific money market and corporate instruments of similar
liquidity and credit quality.
Stock--Based Compensation Plans
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value
method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under APB No. 25, compensation
cost is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the
Company stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the option
granted. Compensation cost for stock options, if any, is recognized ratably
over the vesting period. The Company policy is to grant options with an
exercise price equal to the quoted market price of the Company stock on the
grant date. Accordingly, no compensation has been recognized for its stock
option plans. The Company provides additional pro forma disclosures as
required under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
3. ACQUISITION AND MERGER  The purchase price for Paradigm, consisting of the value of Paradigm common
stock outstanding at the date of the merger, costs incurred by IXYS and the
Paradigm liabilities assumed, has been allocated to Paradigm tangible and
intangible assets based on relative fair values as follows                                   
Current  $  484
Fixed    810

Other   1,463

$12,388
41                IXYS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  The amounts allocated to intangible assets, including in-process research
and development, were based on results of an independent appraisal. Acquired
in-process research and development represented development projects in areas
that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future
use and were valued using the stage of completion methodology prescribed by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, and were charged to operations at the
date of the acquisition.
Intangible amortization of $1,463,000 and the writeoff of goodwill in the
amount of $7,752,000 was recorded as expense in fiscal 1999. The value of the
in-process research development acquired in the transaction, in the amount of
$1,186,000, was recorded as an expense immediately following the transaction
as the products under development had not reached technological feasibility
and there was no other alternative future use for the costs incurred. The
aforementioned items are included within the operating statement caption
Sales, general and administrative.
In conjunction with the merger, all outstanding shares of mandatorily
redeemable convertible preferred stock were converted to common stock and the
carrying value of $37,556,000 has been reclassified as stockholders' equity.
The following unaudited proforma consolidated statement of operations

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Litigation
In February 1997, in U.S. District Court, a judgment was entered against
IXYS for $365 million related to the sale of products that infringed certain
patents. IXYS paid $313 million of the $365 million judgment in 1997 and
filed an appeal in U.S. Federal Court. Through the appeal process, IXYS
accrued the unpaid portion of the judgment and was accruing royalty expense in
accordance with the Court judgment. At March 31, 1997, IXYS was holding
approximately $575,000 in an escrow account for payment of the balance of the
judgment.
In December 1997, IXYS entered into a settlement agreement with the
plaintiff, whereby there would be no liability to IXYS. The agreement is
subject to ratification by the U.S. District Court, and during 1998, the
plaintiff returned the $313 million payment plus interest which is included
in other income on the consolidated statements of income.
On August 12, 1996, the Company and Michael Gulett, Robert McClelland,
Richard A. Veldhouse, Dennis McDonald and Chiang Lam the Paradigm
Defendants were named, along with PaineWebber, Inc., as defendants in a
purported class action entitled Bulwa et al. v. Paradigm Technology, Inc. et
al., Santa Clara County Superior Court Case No. CV759991 brought on behalf of
stockholders who purchased the Company stock between November 20, 1995 and
March 22, 1996 the Class Period.
The complaint asserted six causes of action against the Paradigm Defendants:
negligent misrepresentation, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, violations of
California Corporations Code sections 25400 and 25500 Sections 25400 and
25500, violation of Corporations Code section 1507, and violation of
California Civil Code sections 1709 and 1710.
The Paradigm Defendants responded to the complaint by filing a demurrer
which challenged the legal sufficiency of all six causes of action. On
December 12, 1996, the Court sustained the demurrer as to all of the causes of
action except for the fourth cause of action for violation of Sections 25400
and 25500 and as to all causes of action for defendant Michael Gulett. The
Court, however, granted plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint to attempt to
cure the defects which caused the Court to sustain the demurrer. Plaintiffs
failed to amend within the allotted time and independently expressed an intent
to prosecute only the fourth cause of action. On January 8, 1997, the Paradigm
Defendants, with the exception of Michael Gulett who by virtue of the ruling
on the demurrer has obtained a dismissal with prejudice as to all causes of
action asserted against him, filed an answer to the complaint denying any
liability for the acts and damages alleged by the plaintiffs.
Plaintiffs have since served the Paradigm Defendants with discovery requests
for production of documents and interrogatories, to which the Paradigm
Defendants have responded. Plaintiffs have also subpoenaed documents from
various third parties. The Paradigm Defendants have served the plaintiffs with
an initial set of discovery requests, to which plaintiffs have responded. The
Paradigm Defendants also took the depositions of the named plaintiffs on April
9, 1997.
On January 15, 1997, plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the matter as a
class action. After several hearings and continuances, on February 9, 1998 the
Court certified a class consisting only of California purchasers of the
Company stock during the Class Period. Following the California Supreme
Court decision in Diamond Multimedia Systems, Inc. v. Superior Court, 19 Cal.
4th 1036 1999, plaintiffs moved to modify the prior class certification
ruling to include also non-California purchaser. The Court granted this motion
on April 28, 1999.
On April 9, 1998, the court granted plaintiffs' motion to amend their
complaint to incorporate factual allegations derived from the Campbell, et al.
action described below. The court overruled the Paradigm Defendants' demurrer
to the amended complaint on August 6, 1998. The Paradigm Defendants filed an
answer to the amended complaint on August 27, 1998. There can be no assurance
that the Company will be successful
45                IXYS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
in the defense of this action. If unsuccessful in the defense of any such
claim, the Company business, operating results and cash flows could be
materially adversely affected.
On December 4, 1998, defendant Dennis McDonald, Paradigm former Vice
President of Human Resources, filed a motion for summary judgment on the
amended complaint. Following his deposition, and prior to the hearing on the
motion, plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the defendant McDonald from the action
with prejudice in exchange for a waiver of costs. Defendant McDonald has since
obtained a judgment of dismissal.
On February 21, 1997, an additional purported class action, with causes of
action and factual allegations essentially identical to those of the Bulwa, et
al. action, was filed by the law firm of Stull, Stull & Brody in the Santa
Clara County Superior Court on behalf of stockholders who held the Company
stock between November 20, 1995 and March 22, 1996. The action was entitled
Chai, et al. v. Paradigm Technology Inc. et al. Case No. CV764259, and was
asserted against the same Paradigm Defendants as in the Bulwa, et al. action,
PaineWebber, Inc. and Smith Barney. Prior to the hearing on the Paradigm
Defendants' demurrer to the initial complaint, plaintiff amended his complaint
to incorporate factual allegations derived from the Campbell, et al. action
described below. The Paradigm Defendants filed a demurrer to the amended
complaint, which was heard on September 9, 1997.
On September 10, 1997, the Court issued an order sustaining the Paradigm
Defendants' demurrer as to all causes of action without leave to amend. A
judgment in favor of the Paradigm Defendants dismissing the entire complaint
was entered by the Court on September 23, 1997. Plaintiff appealed the
decision, but on November 13, 1998 the Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment.
Plaintiff petition for rehearing was denied. The time for filing a petition
for review by the Supreme Court has expired.
On May 19, 1997, Thomas Campbell, James Zulliger and Mark Wagenhals, former
employees of the Company, filed an action Campbell, et al. v. Paradigm
Technology, Inc., et al., Case No. CV766271 in Santa Clara County Superior
Court. The complaint named as defendants the Company, Michael Gulett, Richard
Veldhouse, Dennis McDonald and Chiang Lam. The Campbell plaintiffs filed with
the complaint a notice that they considered their case related legally and
factually to the Bulwa action discussed above. The Campbell complaint
contained causes of action for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, violations of
California Corporations Code sections 25400-25402, 25500-25502 and 25504 and
violation of California Civil Code sections 1709-1710. The Campbell complaint
alleged that the defendants misled them and committed fraud by allegedly
overstating the Company back orders in the fourth quarter of 1995 and
inflated reported sales in the fourth quarter of 1995 and the first quarter of
1996, which allegedly resulted in distorting the Company financial
condition, which allegedly inflated its stock price. Plaintiffs alleged that
they purchased the Company stock at the allegedly inflated prices and were
damaged thereby. The complaint sought an unspecified amount of compensatory,
rescissory and/or punitive damages. Defendants responded to the complaint on
September 12, 1997 by filing a demurrer as to all causes of action. Prior to
the hearing on the demurrer, plaintiffs amended their complaint to identify
two allegedly fraudulent sale transactions. Defendants filed a demurrer as to
all causes of action in the amended complaint, which was heard on April 2,
1998. That same day, the Court issued its order sustaining the demurrer on
multiple grounds, but granted plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint by May
15, 1998. Defendants filed a demurrer in response to the second amended
complaint, which was heard on September 3, 1998. That same day, the Court
sustained the demurrer but granted plaintiffs leave to file a third amended
complaint by September 30, 1998. Plaintiffs then filed a third amended
complaint. Following defendants' filing of a demurrer to the third amended
complaint, plaintiffs agreed to dismiss their claims with prejudice in
exchange for defendants' agreement not to seek to recover defendants' costs
incurred in defending against the action. The third amended complaint was
dismissed with prejudice on December 11, 1998 and the defendants agreed not to
pursue any action against the plaintiffs for having filed the action.
46                IXYS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  On May 19, 1998, the law firm that filed the Bulwa, et al. action described
above filed an additional securities class action lawsuit against the Company,
Michael Gulett, Robert McClelland, Richard A. Veldhouse and Chiang Lam, this
time in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California. The complaint alleged violations of section 10b of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act, the
Commission Rule 10b-5 and section 20a of the Exchange Act. Plaintiff alleged
the same class and the same substantive factual allegations that are contained
in the Bulwa, et al. action as amended. Defendants responded to the complaint
on July 27, 1998 by filing a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to
state claims upon which relief can be granted and for various pleading
inadequacies. In lieu of opposing the motion, plaintiff filed a first amended
complaint. Defendants renewed their motion to dismiss, and on January 20, 1999
the Court issued an order granting the motion and dismissing plaintiff
action and entered judgment thereon. On February 3, 1999, the Court entered an
amended judgment clarifying that the judgment is with prejudice. On March 12,
1999, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal.
IXYS is involved in various other litigation and potential claims. Due to
the inherent uncertainty of litigation, management is not able to reasonably
estimate losses that may be incurred in relation to this litigation. Although
no assurance can be given as to the results of these cases, based on the
present status, management does not believe that results of the aforementioned
actions will have a material adverse effect on the Company financial
condition or results of operations.

In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123 SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-
Based Compensation, which was effective for IXYS' fiscal year 1997. SFAS 123
allows companies to either account for stock-based compensation under the new
provisions of SFAS 123 or under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, but
requires pro forma disclosure in the footnotes to the financial statements as
if the measurement provisions of SFAS 123 had been adopted.
IXYS has continued to account for its stock based compensation under the
Plan in accordance with APB 25. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been
recognized for stock options granted under the Plan. Had compensation cost for
the Plan been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for awards
in fiscal years 1996, 1997 and 1998 consistent with the provisions of SFAS No.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  In future years, annual compensation expense will vary relative to the
vesting of options granted in those future years.
In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123, the fair value of each option
is estimated using the Black- Scholes model using the following assumptions
used for grants for the year ended March 31, 1999; dividend yield of 0 volatility of 83%, risk-free interest rates of between 433% to 567% at the
date of grant and an expected term of four years. The weighted-average fair
value of options granted during 1998 and 1999 was $1625 and $3481 per share,
respectively.
IXYS has sold 3,908,095 shares of common stock to certain members of IXYS'
management under a restricted stock purchase agreement subject to IXYS' right
of repurchase, which lapses ratably over five years. The shares were purchased
through recourse promissory notes at a purchase price of $022 per share.
Interest is due on the notes at a rate of 5% per annum, with the balance
outstanding due in full November 2000. At March 31, 1998 and 1999, 187,077
shares and 72,550 shares of common stock are subject to IXYS' right of
repurchase, respectively.
Reverse Stock Split
On May 1, 1998, the Company stockholders approved a 10-for-1 reverse stock
split of the Company common stock, such that every 10 shares shall be
combined into one share of common stock. Common share and per share data for
1999 have been restated to reflect this stock split.
A Stock Split was effected in September 1998 by the Company Board of
Directors which approved a 1-for-15 reverse split of the Company common
stock that was applicable to shareholders of record on June 16, 1998 and
effective on September 23, 1998. References to share and per-share data for
1999 have been adjusted to give effect to this stock split.
10. EMPLOYEE SAVINGS AND RETIREMENT PLAN  IXYS has a 401K plan, known as the IXYS Corporation and Subsidiary Employee
Savings and Retirement Plan. Eligibility to participate in the plan is
subject to certain minimum service requirements. Employees may voluntarily
contribute up to 20% of yearly compensation and IXYS may make matching
contributions as determined by the Board of Directors in a resolution on or
before the end of the fiscal year. Employees are 100% vested immediately. For
the years ended March 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, IXYS contributed $76,000 96,000 and $113,000, respectively.
11. PENSION PLANS  Employees of IXYS GmbH participate in a number of employee retirement plans,
including a defined benefit pension plan, the benefits for which will be paid
out of the general assets of IXYS GmbH, as well as other government sponsored
retirement plans to which IXYS GmbH and eligible employees are required to
contribute.
In addition to providing income at retirement, many of these plans also
provide survivor, termination and disability benefits. The defined benefits
pension plan covers substantially all employees and benefits are based on
years of service and the employees' compensation.

Company also has federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $500,000 and federal alternative minimum tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $342,000. The net operating loss and research
and development tax credit carryforwards expire in varying amounts from 2008
to 2018. The alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards can be carried
forward indefinitely.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 limits the utilization of net operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the
stock ownership of a company. Due to the merger of the Company with Paradigm
Technology, Inc. Paradigm in September of 1998, a change in ownership of
Paradigm took place. As a result of the change in ownership, a portion of the
Company net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards will be subject to
an annual limitation of approximately $400,000.
Due to the uncertainty of the realization of certain tax carryforwards
related to the Paradigm transaction, the Company has established a valuation
allowance against these carryforward benefits in the amount of $4,128,000.
