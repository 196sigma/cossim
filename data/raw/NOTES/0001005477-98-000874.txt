1--The quarterly results of operations for 1997 include the acquisitions in
January of the Kentucky Cluster and the WI-4 RSA.
2--In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 128,
Earnings per Share. Statement 128 replaced the calculation of primary and fully
diluted earnings per share with basic and diluted earnings per share. Unlike
primary earnings per share, basic earnings per share exclude any dilutive
effects of options, warrants and convertible securities. All earnings loss per
share amounts for all periods have been presented and, where appropriate,
restated to conform to Statement 128 requirements. In computing dilutive
earnings loss per share for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995,
no effect has been given to options outstanding under the Company 1994 Stock
Option Plan, outstanding warrants to purchase Class B Common Stock, the 12-3/4%
Senior Convertible Discount Notes or the Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock,
since the exercise of any of these items would have an antidilutive effect on
net loss per share. Item 1.    2
