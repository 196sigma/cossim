OF OPERATION
General
AirNet consolidated financial statements have been and will be affected by the
following factors Acquisitions
On August 11, 1998, AirNet acquired all of the outstanding common stock of
Mercury Business Services, Inc., an Express delivery management service located
in Boston, Massachusetts, for 117,647 AirNet common shares and approximately
$20 million cash.
AirNet completed three acquisitions in 1997. On January 30, 1997, all of the
outstanding shares of Express Convenience Center, Inc., a national small package
forwarder, were acquired for 145,953 AirNet common shares. The transaction was
accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. Consequently, all financial data has
been restated to reflect the operations of ECC. On June 6, 1997, AirNet acquired
all of the outstanding shares of Pacific Air Charter, Inc., a regional airline
in the business of transporting canceled checks, for $04 million cash. On July
31, 1997, AirNet acquired all of the outstanding shares of Data Air Courier,
Inc., a national transporter of canceled checks and small packages through a
ground delivery network and commercial airlines, for approximately $40 million
cash.
The results of operations of Mercury, PAC and Data Air have been included in the
financial data since the respective dates of the acquisitions.
Acquisition Termination Charge
On June 17, 1998, AirNet announced that it had terminated an agreement to
acquire Q International Courier, Inc. Quick. AirNet incurred $24 million of
costs in conjunction with this termination, all of which were expensed upon the
termination of the agreement. Subsequent to the termination of the agreement,
AirNet agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by Quick in connection with the
termination of the acquisition. Settlement and litigation costs related to the
suit totaled approximately $32 million and were fully expensed as of December
31, 1998.
Start-Up Costs
In April 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued
Statement of Position SOP No. 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up
Activities, which requires that costs related to start-up activities be expensed
as incurred. Prior to 1999, AirNet capitalized start-up costs associated with
its premium products line of business. Effective July 1, 1998, the company
ceased capitalizing these costs and began amortizing the previously capitalized
costs over five years. The company adopted the provisions of the SOP in its
financial statements as of January 1, 1999.
Results of Operations
Year ended December 31, 1999 compared to year ended December 31, 1998
Total net revenues were $1287 million for the twelve months ended December 31,
1999, an increase of $151 million, or 132%, over the twelve months ended
December 31, 1998. Net revenues from check delivery increased $57 million, or
62%. This increase was comprised of $19 million related to price increases in
1999 and $16 million related to operating a full year of the Federal Reserve
weekend program, which was introduced in the fourth quarter of 1998. In
addition, net revenues increased due to one additional flying day in 1999
compared to 1998, and increased business activity from both new and existing
customers.                    11 Net revenues from Express delivery increased $96 million, or 503%, from 1998
to 1999. Of this increase, $42 million was due to a whole year of Mercury
operations versus a partial year in 1998, as Mercury was acquired in August
1998. $53 million of the increase in Express revenue was due to growth in
premium product shipments requiring specialized AirNet line-haul service,
SameDay commercial airline service or hazardous material handling. These
increases were offset by lower revenue from wholesale customers freight
forwarders and customers requiring less time-critical standard service as
AirNet continued its sales emphasis on premium services.
Total costs and expenses were $1156 million in 1999, an increase of $182
million, or 187%, over 1998. This resulted in income from operations of $131
million in 1999, compared to $163 million in 1998. Air transportation expenses
rose $145 million, or 175%.
In addition to the effects of capitalizing $08 million of start-up costs
related to the Express business in the first half of 1998 and expensing such
costs as incurred in 1999, air transportation costs increased to support growth
in the Express delivery area and the addition of Federal Reserve shipments to
the weekend program. Wages and benefits were up $25 million and ground courier
costs were up $30 million due to additional personnel to support the increased
weekend operations and Express business growth. Aircraft fuel costs were up
113%, or $11 million, compared to 1998 as jet and piston fuel prices rose
significantly during 1999. Outside services were up $03 million due to
outsourced routes related to pilot shortages. Depreciation expense was up $13
million, or 128%, primarily due to aircraft overhauls, engine additions and
inspections in late 1998 and 1999. Other expense increased $52 million
primarily due to a $15 million increase in workers' compensation costs, $29
million increase in commercial freight expense related to a full year of Mercury
operations and significant increases in bank and Express shipments shipped via
the commercial airlines.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $35 million, or
251%, compared to 1998. $09 million of this increase was a result of expensing
start-up costs as incurred in 1999 compared to capitalizing start-up costs in
the first half of 1998. Increased expenses of $25 million in the administrative
payroll areas were a result of the addition of personnel to support growth in
AirNet Express service, a full year of Mercury operations, and the hiring of a
new president. Commission expense increased in conjunction with Express revenue
growth. Additionally, bad debt expense increased $04 million due to a dispute
with one customer. $09 million of the selling, general and administrative
increase was related to the use of outside consultants. These increases were
offset by decreases in officer severance packages and the one-time cost of a
consulting study related to the call center in 1998.
In 1998, AirNet incurred a $56 million charge in connection with the write-off
of costs associated with the efforts to acquire Quick and the settlement of a
related lawsuit. The impact of the one-time $56 million charge decreased fully
diluted net income per share by $027 in 1998. Settlement of the litigation and
write-off of the acquisition costs were recorded as of December 31, 1998
resulting in no impact to the 1999 financial results.
Interest costs were $25 million in fiscal 1999, compared to $13 million in
1998. AirNet increased the average outstanding balance on its revolving credit
facility in 1999 primarily as the result of the $20 million stock buyback
program executed in the second half of 1998.
AirNet recorded tax expense of $43 million for fiscal 1999 compared to $37
million for fiscal 1998.
Year ended December 31, 1998 compared to year ended December 31, 1997
Net revenues were $1137 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998,
an increase of $159 million, or 163%, over the twelve months ended December
31, 1997. Net revenues from check delivery increased $125 million, or 155%.
This included $44 million which can be attributed to price increases effective
January 1, 1998 and approximately $69 million from the Data Air and PAC
acquisitions being in place for a full year. The balance of the increase can be
attributed to the introduction of a weekend delivery program in April, 1997 and
increased business activity from both new and existing customers during 1998.
AirNet operated its full air system 199 days in both 1998 and 1997.                    12 Net revenues from Express delivery increased $34 million, or 220%, from fiscal
1997 to fiscal 1998. Approximately $28 million of the increase was due to the
addition of Mercury in 1998. An increase of $40 million in premium product
shipments requiring LateNight or SameDay service was offset by a $32 million
decrease in the services provided to wholesale customers freight forwarders
and customers requiring less time-critical standard services. This decrease
resulted from AirNet strategic decision to decrease its wholesale and standard
service business in late 1997 and early 1998 and emphasize the LateNight and
SameDay services.
Total costs and expenses, prior to the acquisition termination charge, were
$974 million in fiscal 1998, an increase of $217 million, or 287%, over
fiscal 1997. This resulted in income from operations of $163 million in fiscal
1998, compared to $221 million in fiscal 1997. Air transportation expenses rose
$168 million, or 254%, while selling, general and administrative expenses
increased $52 million, or 612%, for the fiscal year.
Air transportation costs increased primarily as a result of the acquisitions and
infrastructure costs in anticipation of growth in the Express delivery area. The
greatest effect of the infrastructure buildup occurred in ground courier
operations where overall wages increased $49 million, of which approximately
$21 million can be attributed to the full year of Data Air operations, compared
to five months in 1997. Healthcare costs were up $15 million over 1997 levels
due to the addition of covered personnel and an anomaly of claims experienced in
the third and fourth quarter. The costs associated with shipping packages on the
commercial airlines increased $47 million due to the addition of Mercury, the
full year of Data Air operations and the increase in the volume of SameDay
shipments experienced in the Express service business. Aircraft maintenance and
fuel expenses remained flat over 1997 levels, despite an 113% increase in
flight hours, due to the unusually good flying weather experienced in 1998 and
lower fuel prices. Depreciation increased $17 million, or 208%, primarily due
to the increase in aircraft, from 113 at December 31, 1997 to 119 at December
31, 1998, additional vehicles acquired through the Data Air acquisition and the
purchase of AirNet main operational facility in October, 1997. AirNet also
experienced a pilot shortage, which impacted its operations in the last half of
1998, requiring it to charter routes with third party operators. The impact of
the pilot shortage was approximately $05 million for fiscal 1998.
In the selling, general and administrative area, payroll and related expenses
increased $10 million primarily due to the addition of personnel in fiscal
1998. A commission plan was established in the first quarter for Express
delivery sales, resulting in $05 million of increased expense over the prior
year. AirNet incurred a $03 million loss related to the Check Exchange System,
Co. and $05 million for the defense and ultimate settlement of two lawsuits
related to issues surrounding the acquisition of Float Control, Inc. and a
non-related covenant not to compete dispute. AirNet also incurred costs
associated with the separation package for an officer who announced his
resignation in December, 1998. In addition, AirNet utilized outside consultants,
especially in the second half of 1998, to assist in the improvement of its
Express delivery call center. AirNet also began amortizing start-up costs
associated with the Express delivery initiative in the third quarter of 1998.
Total amortization for start-up costs in 1998 was $05 million.
In addition, AirNet incurred a $56 million charge in connection with the
write-off of costs associated with the efforts to acquire Quick and the
settlement of a related lawsuit. The impact of the one-time $56 million charge
decreased fully diluted net income per share by $027 in 1998.
Interest costs were $13 million in fiscal 1998, compared to $01 million in
1997. AirNet began borrowing on its line of credit in late 1997 and utilized a
portion of such borrowings to fund the repurchase of $200 million of common
shares in the second half of 1998.
AirNet recorded tax expense of $37 million for fiscal 1998 on income for the
period compared to $88 million for fiscal 1997.
13 Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash flow from operating activities
Net cash flow from operating activities was $195 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999, compared to $120 million for the year ended December 31,
1998.
Current credit arrangements
AirNet maintains a credit agreement with a bank that provides a $500 million,
three-year, unsecured revolving credit facility. The credit agreement limits the
availability of funds to specified percentages of accounts receivable, inventory
and the wholesale value of aircraft and equipment. In addition, the credit
agreement requires the maintenance of minimum net worth and cash flow levels,
imposes limits on payments of dividends to 50% of net income and restricts the
amount of additional debt.
Investing activities
Capital expenditures totaled $176 million for the year ended December 31, 1999
compared to $187 million for fiscal 1998. Approximately $23 million was
incurred in connection with the purchase of a new aircraft and approximately
$150 million was incurred for flight related equipment, engines and
inspections. The remainder was incurred primarily for delivery vehicles,
furniture and fixtures, and computer equipment and related software. AirNet
anticipates it will spend approximately $200 million on capital items in 2000
and will continue to acquire aircraft and flight equipment as necessary to
maintain growth and continue offering quality service to its customers.
The company announced a stock repurchase program in February 2000 for up to $30
million of its common shares. Management and the Board of Directors believe that
AirNet common shares represent an excellent value and an appropriate
investment. Purchases of these common shares will be made over time in the open
market or through privately negotiated transactions.
AirNet anticipates that operating cash and capital expenditure requirements will
continue to be funded by cash flow from operations, cash on hand and bank
borrowings.
Seasonality and Variability in Quarterly Results
AirNet operations historically have been somewhat seasonal and dependent on
the number of banking holidays falling during the week. Because financial
institutions are currently the company principal customers, AirNet air
system is scheduled primarily around the needs of financial institution
customers. When financial institutions are closed, there is no need for AirNet
to operate a full system. AirNet quarter ending December 31 is often the most
impacted by bank holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas. When these
holidays fall on Monday through Thursday, AirNet revenues and net income are
adversely affected. AirNet annual results fluctuate in response to the number
of banking holidays.
Operating results are also affected by the weather. AirNet generally experiences
higher maintenance costs during its first quarter ending March 31. Winter
weather requires additional costs for de-icing, hangar rental and other aircraft
services.                    14 Selected Quarterly Data

Historically, inflation has not been a significant factor to AirNet. Although
the value of AirNet service to its primary customers is enhanced by higher
interest rates, the volume of business has not changed historically with
fluctuating interest rates. AirNet has attempted to minimize the effects of
inflation on its operating results through rate increases and cost controls.
Fuel Surcharge/Rebate Program
AirNet maintains a fuel surcharge/rebate program for its check delivery
customers. Under this program, as the OPIS-CMH Ohio Price Information Service -
Columbus, Ohio Station price of jet fuel exceeds $075 per gallon, customers
are surcharged. In turn, if the OPIS-CMH price falls below $060 per gallon, the
same customers receive a rebate. Due to the recent increases in fuel prices,
AirNet has implemented a 2% temporary fuel surcharge to its Express customers,
effective February 6, 2000. The company intends to rescind the surcharge when
fuel prices return to lower, more stabilized levels.                    15 Year 2000 Impact on Information Systems and Operations
In prior years, AirNet discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become
Year 2000 ready. In 1999, the company completed the remediation and testing of
its systems. As a result of those planning and implementation efforts, the
company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information
technology and non-information technology systems and believes those systems
successfully responded to the Year 2000 date change. The company is not aware of
any material problems resulting from Year 2000 issues, either with its services,
its internal systems, or the products and services of third parties. The company
will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of
its suppliers and vendors throughout the Year 2000 to ensure that any latent
Year 2000 matters that may arise are addressed promptly.
Forward-Looking Statements
Certain matters discussed in this Form 10-K, including, but not limited to,
information regarding future economic performance and plans and objectives of
AirNet management, are forward-looking statements which involve risks and
uncertainties. When used in this document, the words anticipate, estimate,
expect, may, plan, project and similar expressions are intended to be
among statements that identify forward-looking statements. These statements
involve risks and uncertainties such as the following, in addition to other
factors not listed, which could cause actual results to differ materially from
any forward-looking statement: potential changes by the FAA, which could
increase the regulation of AirNet business, or the Federal Reserve, which
could change the competitive environment of transporting canceled checks;
adverse weather conditions; the ability to attract and retain qualified pilots;
technological advances and increases in the use of electronic funds transfers;
AirNet ability to successfully complete and integrate acquisition targets; as
well as other economic, competitive and domestic and foreign governmental
factors affecting AirNet markets, prices and other facets of its operations.
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should
underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from
those indicated. AirNet undertakes no responsibility to update for changes
related to these or any other factors that may hereafter occur. The following
factors, in addition to those factors listed above and other possible factors
not listed, could affect AirNet actual results and cause such results to
differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements Competition
The market for express air and ground delivery service is highly competitive.
AirNet bank services division competes primarily against the Federal Reserve
Bank Check Relay Network, which has significantly greater financial and other
resources than AirNet. The Federal Reserve is regulated by the Monetary Control
Act of 1980, which in general requires that the Federal Reserve price its
services on a cost basis plus a set percentage private sector market adjustment
factor. Failure by the Federal Reserve to comply with the Monetary Control Act
could have an adverse competitive impact on AirNet. In addition, there can be no
assurance that the Monetary Control Act will not be amended, modified or
repealed, or that new legislation affecting AirNet business will not be
enacted. Although major participants in the next-day and second-day air delivery
market such as UPS and FedEx have also entered the business of SameDay and
early morning delivery, they have not had a material adverse effect on AirNet
business to date. However, there can be no assurance that these competitors will
not have a material adverse effect in the future.
Technology
Some analysts have predicted that the increased use of electronic funds
transfers will lead to a checkless society, which could adversely affect the
demand for AirNet check delivery services to the financial services industry.
In addition, some financial services industry analysts have predicted the
development of various forms of imaging technology that could reduce or
eliminate the need for prompt delivery of canceled checks. Similarly,
technological advances in the nature of electronic mail and telefax have
affected the demand for on-call delivery services by express delivery customers.
While none of these technological advances have had a significant adverse impact                    16 on AirNet business to date, there can be no assurances that these or similar
technologies, or other regulatory or technological changes in the check
clearance and national payment systems, will not have an adverse affect on
AirNet business in the future.
Risks Related to Growth Through Acquisitions
AirNet intends to continue to evaluate potential acquisitions, primarily in the
check delivery and express delivery areas. Growth through acquisition involves
substantial risks, including the risk of improper valuation of the acquired
business and the risk of inadequate integration. There can be no assurances that
the suitable acquisition candidates will be available, that AirNet will be able
to acquire or profitably manage such additional companies or that future
acquisitions will produce returns that justify the investment. In addition,
AirNet may compete for acquisitions and expansion opportunities with companies
that have significantly greater resources than the company.
AirNet may finance future acquisitions by using common shares for all or a
portion of the consideration to be paid, which may result in substantial
dilution to the current holders of the common shares. In the event the common
shares do not maintain a sufficient valuation, or potential acquisition
candidates are unwilling to accept the common shares as part of the
consideration for the sale of their businesses, AirNet may be required to
utilize more of its cash resources, if available, in order to pursue its
acquisition strategy. If AirNet does not have sufficient cash resources through
working capital or its current credit facility, its growth potential could be
limited and its existing operations could be impaired unless it is able to
obtain additional capital through future debt or equity financing. There can be
no assurance that AirNet will be able to obtain additional financing or that, if
available, this financing will be on terms acceptable to the company.
Permits and Licensing; Regulation
AirNet delivery operations are subject to various federal, state and local
regulations that in many instances require permits and licenses. Failure by
AirNet to maintain required permits or licenses, or to comply with the
applicable regulations, could result in substantial fines or possible revocation
of the company authority to conduct certain of its operations. Furthermore,
acquisitions by AirNet could be impeded by delays in obtaining approvals for the
transfer of permits or licenses, or failure to obtain such approvals.
AirNet flight operations are regulated by the FAA under Part 135 of the
Federal Aviation Regulations. Among other things, these regulations govern
permissible flight and duty time for aviation flight crews. The FAA is currently
contemplating certain changes in flight and duty time guidelines, which, if
adopted, could increase AirNet operating costs. These changes, if adopted,
could also require AirNet and other operators regulated by the FAA to hire
additional flight crew personnel. In addition, Congress, from time to time, has
considered various means, including excise taxes, to raise revenues directly
from the airline industry to pay for air traffic control facilities and
personnel. There can be no assurances that Congress will not change the current
federal excise tax rate or enact new excise taxes, which could adversely affect
AirNet business.
ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
AirNet is exposed to certain market risks from transactions that are entered
into during the normal course of business. AirNet primary market risk exposure
relates to interest rate risk. At December 31, 1999, the company had a balance
of $339 million on its revolving credit facility. This facility bears interest
at the company option of a fixed rate determined by the Eurodollar rate, a
negotiated rate or a floating rate. Assuming borrowings at December 31, 1999, a
one hundred basis point change in interest rates would impact net interest
expense by approximately $339,000 per year. In 1999, the company entered into
two interest rate swap agreements with a bank as a hedge against the interest
rate risk associated with borrowings. The swap agreements each have a notional
amount of $50 million and effectively locked in a portion of the company
variable rate revolving credit liability at fixed rates of 63% and 65% plus a
margin based on the company funded debt ratio. These swap agreements contain a
three year term.                    17 ITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

22 1.   Significant Accounting Policies
AirNet Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries the company operate a fully
integrated national air transportation network which provides delivery service
for time-critical shipments for customers in the U.S. banking industry and other
industries requiring the express delivery of packages. The company also offers
retail aviation fuel sales and related ground services for customers at its
Columbus, Ohio facility.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated.
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Certain 1997 and 1998 balances have been reclassified to conform with the 1999
presentation.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue on air transportation services is recognized when the packages are
delivered to their destination. Revenue on fixed based operations is recognized
when the maintenance services are complete or fuel is delivered.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments which are
unrestricted as to withdrawal or use, and which have an original maturity of
three months or less. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates
market value.
Accounts Receivable
For 1999, approximately 77% and 66% of the company revenues and related
receivables, respectively, were generated from customers within the banking
industry. The company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers'
financial condition and generally does not require collateral. The company
establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding
the credit risks of specific customers, historical trends and other information.
Inventory and Spare Parts
Inventory and spare parts are valued at the lower of cost weighted average
method or market. At December 31, 1999, the balance included a Learjet, valued
at $3,891,000, held for resale.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Engines, overhauls and major
inspections, which have been capitalized and included in flight equipment, are
depreciated and amortized on the basis of hours flown. Airframes, other flight
equipment and other property and equipment primarily furniture and equipment,
leasehold improvements and vehicles are depreciated using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as summarized below     Airframes                        15 years
Buildings                        30 years
Other flight equipment                2 - 5 years
Other property and equipment            3 - 10 years                    23 During 1997, the company made certain changes in its estimated useful lives and
the salvage values of its aircraft. The changes increased 1997 net income by
$1,050,000, or $08 per share. These changes were made to better reflect how the
aircraft are expected to be used over time and the continued industry trend of
increased market values associated with the types and models of aircraft the
company owns and operates.
The company prepays certain engine repair and overhaul services under
manufacturer service plans. Such prepaid balances, which are capitalized at the
time the maintenance is performed, are included as other property and equipment
and were $2,991,000 and $2,398,000 at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Investment in Subsidiary
AirNet wholly owns Float Control, Inc., which holds a 19% interest in the Check
Exchange System Co. CHEXS. Float Control accounts for its investment in
CHEXS under the equity method of accounting. At December 31, 1999 and 1998,
Float Control recorded investment in CHEXS was $2,065,000 and $2,337,000,
respectively.
Income Taxes
The company accounts for income taxes under the liability method pursuant to
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are
determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax
bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in
effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
Goodwill
Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over 25 years. The company
policy is to periodically review its goodwill and other long-lived assets based
upon the evaluation of such factors as the occurrence of a significant adverse
event of change in the environment in which the business operates or if the
expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest would become less
than the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss would be recorded in
the period such determination is made based on the fair value of the related
businesses.
Financial Instruments
The company uses interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging its exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates. The swaps meet the requirements designation and
correlation for use of the accrual method of accounting. Differentials in the
swapped amounts are recorded as adjustments of the underlying periodic cash
flows that are being hedged. The fair values of the Company financial
instruments approximate their carrying values at December 31, 1999 and 1998.
Intangibles
Intangibles include non-competition agreements, which are being amortized on the
straight-line method over periods ranging from one to 15 years.
Segment Reporting
In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, which establishes annual and interim
reporting and disclosure standards for an enterprise operating segments. SFAS
131 became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. The
Company has historically not segregated costs between its bank and Express
operations. Management has evaluated the standard and determined that, due to                    24 accounting system limitations, it is impracticable to report segment
information. The Company is modifying its accounting systems and will begin
reporting segment information in the first quarter of fiscal year 2000.
Effect of New Accounting Standards
The FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments
and Hedging Activities, in June 1998 and SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative
Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of
FASB Statement No. 133, in June 1999, which are effective for the Company
beginning in the first quarter of 2001. The statements require that all
derivatives be recorded in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and
be measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in fair value of a
derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting
designation. The Company has not determined what impact these statements will
have on its consolidated financial statements.
Supplemental Cash Flow Data
Cash paid for interest was $2,411,000, $1,236,000 and $109,000 for the years
ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Cash paid for taxes was
$559,000, $6,078,000 and $1,312,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999, 1998
and 1997.
2.   Write Off of Start-up Costs
In April 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued
Statement of Position SOP No. 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up
Activities, which requires that costs related to start-up activities be expensed
as incurred. Prior to 1999, the company capitalized start-up costs associated
with its premium products line of business. Effective July 1, 1998, the company
ceased capitalizing such costs and began amortizing the previously capitalized
costs over five years. The company adopted the provisions of the SOP in its
financial statements as of January 1, 1999, which resulted in the write-off of
unamortized start-up costs at that time. Had the company accounted for start-up
costs under SOP 98-5 for all years presented, its net income and net income per
share would have been the following                    1999      1998       1997
Proforma net income         $6,272,000   $4,632,000    $11,715,000
-per share assuming dilution    $055     $037       $092
3.   Acquisitions
Effective August 11, 1998, the company acquired all of the outstanding common
stock of Mercury Business Services, Inc. Mercury, an express delivery
management service located in Boston. The company accounted for the acquisition
under the purchase method of accounting. The purchase price of the acquisition
included $1,827,000 in cash net of cash acquired and approximately 118,000
AirNet common shares and resulted in goodwill of $3,544,000, which is being
amortized over 25 years, and covenants not to compete totaling $300,000. The

revolving credit facility. The agreement has a five-year term and is scheduled
to expire on August 1, 2003. The agreement may be extended in one-year
increments at any point through August 1, 2003. The agreement bears interest at
the company option of a fixed rate determined by the Eurodollar rate, a
negotiated rate or a floating rate, plus a margin based on the company funded
debt ratio. The floating rate is based on the sum of a a margin plus b the                    26

imposes certain limitations on payments of dividends and restricts the amount of
additional debt.

statements of operations. The company does not use derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes.
