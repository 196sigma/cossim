On Command Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of On Command
Corporation a majority-owned subsidiary of Ascent Entertainment Group, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive loss and cash
flows for the year ended December 31, 2000. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of On Command Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
