27  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Sun
Hydraulics Corporation: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sun Hydraulics Corporation a Florida corporation and subsidiaries
collectively, The Company as of December27, 2008 and December29, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December27, 2008. We also have audited Sun Hydraulics Corporation and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December27, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitation, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Sun Hydraulics Corporation and subsidiaries as of December27, 2008 and December29, 2007, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December27, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, Sun Hydraulics Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December27, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. /s/ Kirkland, Russ, Murphy Tapp, P.A. Clearwater, Florida

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements is set forth below: Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts and operations of Sun Hydraulics and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The Company uses the equity method of accounting for its
investments in Sun China, WhiteOak, and HCT. The Company does not have a majority ownership in or exercise control over these entities. Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company currently only applies judgment and estimates, which may have a material effect on the eventual outcome
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, for impairment of long-lived assets, accounts receivable, inventory, goodwill and accruals. The following explains the basis and the procedure for each account where judgment and estimates are applied.
Revenue Recognition The Company reports revenues, net
of sales incentives, when title passes and risk of loss transfers to the customer. The effect of material non-recurring events is provided for when they become known. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets SFAS 144, long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future net cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If such assets
are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value. 
33  The Company assesses the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization under SFASNo.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142. See Goodwill below. Accounts Receivable The Company sells to most of its customers on a recurring basis, primarily through distributors with which the Company maintains long-term relationships. As a result, bad
debt experience has not been material. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined on a specific identification basis by a review of those accounts that are significantly in arrears. There can be no assurance that a distributor or a large
direct sale customer with overdue accounts receivable balances will not develop financial difficulties and default on payment. See the consolidated balance sheets for allowance amounts. Inventory The Company offers a wide variety of standard products and as a matter of policy does not discontinue
products. On an ongoing basis, component parts found to be obsolete through design or process changes are disposed of and charged to material cost. The Company reviews on-hand balances of products and component parts against specific criteria.
Products and component parts without usage or that have excess quantities on hand are evaluated. An inventory reserve is then established for the full inventory carrying value of those products and component parts deemed to be obsolete or slow
moving. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for inventory reserve amounts. Goodwill The Company acquired its Korean operations in September 1998 using the purchase method. As a result, goodwill is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet. A valuation
based on the cash flow method was performed at December27, 2008 and December29, 2007. It was determined that the value of the goodwill was not impaired. There is no assurance that the value of the acquired company will not decrease in
the future due to changing business conditions. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for goodwill amounts. Accruals The Company makes estimates related to certain employee benefits and miscellaneous accruals. Estimates for employee benefit accruals are based on managements
assessments of estimated liabilities related to workers compensation, health care benefits and annual contributions to an employee stock ownership plan ESOP, established in 2004 as part of the Companys retirement plan.
Estimates for miscellaneous accruals are based on managements assessment of estimated liabilities for costs incurred. The Company accrues for health
care benefit costs under a self-funded plan. The Company purchases re-insurance for both specific and aggregate stop losses on claims that exceed $115 on an individual basis and approximately $6,300 on an aggregate basis. Stock Split On June19, 2007, the Company declared a
three-for-two stock split, effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend, to shareholders of record on June30, 2007, payable on July15, 2007. The Company issued approximately 5,500,000 shares of common stock as a result of the stock
split. The effect of the stock split on outstanding shares, earnings per share and dividends per share has been retroactively applied to all periods presented. Management Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
34  Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Obsolete and slow
moving inventory is evaluated and reserves are established based on specific criteria determined by management. Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Expenditures for repairs and improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend
the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the following useful lives:  Years
Computer equipment
3-5
Machinery and equipment
4-12
Furniture and fixtures
4-10
Leasehold and land improvements
5-15
Buildings
40
Gains or losses on the retirement, sale, or disposition of property, plant, and equipment are reflected in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations in the period in which the assets are taken out of service. Valuation Assessment of Long-Lived Assets
Management periodically evaluates long-lived assets for potential impairment and will provide for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Assets are reviewed for utilization on a monthly basis by management in conjunction with employees who work directly with the assets. Goodwill Goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price
of acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired and other acquisition costs, is carried at cost. In accordance with SFAS 142, goodwill is not amortized by the Company. Instead, SFAS 142 requires goodwill to be reviewed for impairment
on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate possible impairment. Other Assets Other assets consist of equity investments in the Companys joint ventures in Sun China, WhiteOak and HCT. The equity investments were recorded at cost and have been
adjusted for investment income or loss and dividend distributions for each quarterly period since their origin. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized when products are shipped and title to the products is passed to the customer. Sales incentives are granted to customers based upon the volume of
purchases. These sales incentives are recorded at the time of sales as a reduction of gross sales. Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs billed to distributors and customers are recorded in revenue. Shipping costs incurred by the Company are recorded in cost of goods sold.
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions The
Company follows the translation policy provided by SFAS No52, Foreign Currency Translation. The PoundSterling is the functional currency of Sun Ltd. The Euro is the functional currency of Sun GmbH. The South Korean Won is the
functional currency of Sun Korea. The U.S.Dollar is the functional currency for Sun Hydraulics and the reporting currency for the consolidated group. The assets and liabilities of Sun Ltd., Sun GmbH, and Sun Korea are translated at the
exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date, and income and expense items are translated at the average annual rate of exchange for the period. The resulting unrealized translation gains and losses are included as a 
35  
component of shareholders equity designated as accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses from foreign currency
transactions are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Income Taxes The Company follows the income tax policy provided by SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109. This Statement provides for a liability approach under which deferred income taxes are
provided for based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the taxes become payable. These differences result from items reported differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes, primarily depreciation, accrued
expenses and reserves. In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, and Related Implementation Issues
FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a Companys financial statements in accordance with FASB No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition
threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
The Company adopted FIN 48 effective January1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material effect on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $36 and $34, including accrued
interest, at December27, 2008, and December29, 2007, respectively. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for tax amounts. Stock-Based
Compensation The Company accounts for stock compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS
No123R, Share-Based Payment, SFAS 123R for its share-based compensation plans. All share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense in
earnings over the requisite service period. Benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs are reported as a financing cash inflow. 3. ACQUISITIONS On November30, 2007, Sun Hydraulics acquired shares of preferred and common stock totaling 48% of the outstanding
shares of HCT. HCT designs and manufacturers ruggedized electronic/hydraulic control solutions for mobile equipment markets; products include digital valve controllers, designed specifically for the hydraulic industry, and a patented suite of
software products called IntellaTM. The products modular architecture allows customers to add functionality, reliability, and precision, while preserving their investment in prior application development. HCT complements the Companys
electro-hydraulic efforts, including its earlier investment in WhiteOak Controls. The acquisition price paid by the Company was $2,375. The excess paid over pro rata share of net assets of $1,363 is for developed technology, which is included within
the investment account, and is being amortized over a period of 10 years. Sun Hydraulics will have the option to purchase the remaining outstanding stock of HCT after December31, 2009, at a purchase price that will approximate fair market
value. 4. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SFAS
No157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. SFAS 157 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in
active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no
market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value
on a recurring basis at December27, 2008. The Company did not have any fair value adjustments for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December27, 2008. 
36  The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts
payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value based on their short-term status. The carrying amount of long-term debt
approximates fair value, as the interest rates on the debt approximate rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. 5. RESTRICTED CASH On December27, 2008 and December29, 2007, the Company had restricted cash of $127 and
$146, respectively. $44 and $60 of the 2008 and 2007 restricted cash balance, respectively, consisted of reserves for customs and excise taxes in the U.K. operation. The restricted amount was calculated as an estimate of two months of customs and
excise taxes for items coming into the Companys U.K. operations and was held with Lloyds TSB in the U.K. The remaining 2008 and 2007 amounts relate to a guarantee of VAT in our France operation. The guarantee is held with Crdit
Agricole Bank in France. 6.

The analysis indicated that there was no impairment of the carrying value of the
goodwill.

40  Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income taxes. The temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December27, 2008 and December29, 2007
are presented below:  December27 December29 2008 2007 Deferred tax assets Current Accrued expenses and other 259 301 Total current deferred tax assets 259 301 Noncurrent Accrued expenses and other 387 57 Deferred royalty income 29 47 Total noncurrent deferred tax assets 416 104 Deferred tax liabilities Noncurrent Depreciation 5,287 5,137 Other 75 Total noncurrent deferred tax liabilities 5,287 5,212 Net noncurrent deferred tax liability 4,871 5,108 A valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported is required if, based on the weight of the
evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. For the fiscal years ended 2008 and 2007, management has determined that a valuation allowance is not required. The Company intends and has the ability to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, which reflect full provision for non-U.S. income taxes, to
expand its international operations. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and, at December27, 2008, cumulative earnings were approximately $28 million. Accordingly, no provision has been made for U.S. income taxes that might be payable
upon repatriation of such earnings. In the event any earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries are repatriated, the Company will provide U.S. income taxes upon repatriation of such earnings, which will be offset by applicable foreign tax credits, subject to
certain limitations. Due to specific circumstances, during the years ended December27, 2008 and December30, 2006, the Company repatriated $6,000 and $5,000 ,respectively, from its foreign subsidiaries. U.S. income taxes due based on the
repatriations have been provided for in the above income tax provisions. In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes, and Related Implementation Issues FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a Companys financial statements in accordance with FASB No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The Company adopted FIN 48 effective January1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material effect on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. 
41  The following is a roll-forward of the Companys unrecognized tax benefits:  Unrecognized tax benefitsJanuary1, 2007 208 Increases from positions taken during prior periods 34 Lapse of statute of limitations 208 Unrecognized tax benefitsDecember 29, 2007 34 Increases from positions taken during prior periods 2 Lapse of statute of limitations Unrecognized tax benefitsDecember 27, 2008 36 As of January1, 2007, the Company had an unrecognized tax benefit of $208 including accrued interest. During
2007, the Company recognized the tax benefit of $208, which had a favorable effect on the effective tax rate for the period ended December29, 2007. At December27, 2008, the Company had an unrecognized tax benefit of $36 including accrued interest. If recognized, the unrecognized tax benefit would have a favorable effect on the effective tax rate in future periods. The Company
recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Interest related to the unrecognized tax benefit has been recognized and included in income tax expense. Interest accrued as of December27, 2008, is not
considered material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company files U.S. federal income tax returns as well as income tax
returns in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2004 for the majority of tax jurisdictions. The Companys federal returns are currently under examination in the United States for the periods 2004 through 2007. To date, there have been no material
assessments related to this audit. 14. STOCK OPTION PLANS During 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Stock Option Plan the Stock Option Plan, which provides for the grant of incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 2,250,000
shares of the Companys common stock by officers, employees and directors of the Company. Under the terms of the plan, incentive stock options may be granted to employees at an exercise price per share of not less than the fair value per common

options for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 750,000 shares of the Companys common stock by officers, employees and directors of the Company. The Company adopted the 2006 Plan due to the expiration of the Companys 1996 Stock Option
Plan in 2006. Under the terms of the plan, incentive stock options may be granted to employees at an exercise price per share of not less than the fair value per common share on the date of the grant not less than 110% of the fair value in the case
of holders of more than 10% of the Companys voting stock. Nonqualified stock options may be granted at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors. The maximum term of an option may not exceed 10 years, and options become
exercisable at such times and in such installments as determined by the Board of Directors. No awards have been granted under the 2006 Plan. During 2001,
the Company adopted the 2001 Restricted Stock Plan, which provides for the grant of restricted stock of up to an aggregate of 618,750 shares of the Companys common stock to officers, employees, consultants and directors of the Company. Under
the terms of the plan, the minimum period before any shares become non-forfeitable may not be less than six months. Restricted stock granted prior to January1, 2006, was accounted for using the measurement and recognition principles of APB 25.
Effective January1, 2006, the company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123R. Accordingly, compensation cost has been measured at the date of the grant and is recognized in earnings over the 
43  
period in which the shares vest. Restricted stock expense for the years ended December27, 2008, December27, 2007, and December30, 2006
totaled $722, $507, and $413, respectively. At December27, 2008, 127,589 shares remained available to be issued through the Restricted Stock Plan. A

73 2145 The Company has $1,310 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards granted under
the Plan as of December27, 2008. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 148 years. Pursuant to SFAS 123R, the $741 of unearned compensation recorded as a reduction to stockholders equity as of
December31, 2005, was reversed against the Companys additional paid-in-capital. During 2001, the Company adopted the Employee Stock Purchase
Plan ESPP, which became effective August1, 2001. Most employees are eligible to participate. Employees who choose to participate are granted an opportunity to purchase common stock at 85 percent of market value on the first or
last day of the quarterly purchase period, whichever is lower. The ESPP authorizes the issuance, and the purchase by employees, of up to 731,250 shares of common stock through payroll deductions. No employee is allowed to buy more than $25,000 of
common stock in any year, based on the market value of the common stock at the beginning of the purchase period. Employees purchased 15,971 shares at an average price of $2250 and 17,987 shares at an average price of $1510, under the ESPP during
2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company recognized $92 and $137 of compensation expense during 2008 and 2007, respectively, in accordance with SFAS 123R. At December27, 2008, 567,771 shares remained available to be issued through the ESPP.
The Company has a Nonemployee Director Equity and Deferred Compensation Plan the Plan, which originally was adopted by the Board of
Directors and approved by the shareholders in 2004. The Plan was amended on March1, 2008 and was approved by the shareholders at the 2008 Annual Meeting. Under the Plan, Directors who are not officers of the Company are paid 250 shares of
Company common stock and $3 in fees for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors, as well as each meeting of each Board Committee on which they serve when the committee meeting is not held within one day of a meeting of the Board of
Directors. Additionally, the Board of Directors has the authority to increase from time to time, as it deems desirable or appropriate, the number of shares of stock awarded to all or any one or more of the Nonemployee Directors. No more than 25,000
shares of stock, in the aggregate, may be issued under the Plan during any single calendar year. Committee Chairmen currently receive additional fees equal to 25% of normal compensation and the Chairman of the Board is paid twice the amount of
normal compensation, with such additional compensation payable in Company common stock. Previously under the Plan, Nonemployee Directors were paid $5 of which half was paid in Company common stock. 
44  Directors may elect under the Plan to receive all or part of their cash fees in Company stock and to defer receipt of
their fees until a subsequent year. The Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 180,000 shares of common stock. Directors were granted 7,961 and 3,854
shares during 2008 and 2007, respectively. At December27, 2008, there were 16,907 deferred stock units outstanding. Deferred stock units are treated as liabilities in accordance with FAS 123R. The Company recognized director stock compensation
expense of $79 and $189, for 2008 and 2007, respectively. At December27, 2008, 153,653 shares remained available to be issued through the Plan. 15. STOCK REPURCHASE PLANS In June 2006, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $25 million of Company
stock, to be completed no later than January15, 2007. The stock purchases were made in the open market. Market purchases were made subject to restrictions relating to volume, price and timing in an effort to minimize the impact of the
purchases on the market for the Companys securities. The amount of the stock repurchased was used to continue to fund the Companys employee stock ownership and employee stock purchase plans. Under the plan, which was completed in July
2006, the Company had repurchased 203,073 shares at an average price of $1231. All shares were retired during the year. In December 2005, the
Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $20 million of Company stock, to be completed no later than January15, 2007. The stock purchases were made in the open market. Market purchases were made subject to
restrictions relating to volume, price and timing in an effort to minimize the impact of the purchases on the market for the Companys securities. The amount of the stock repurchases was set based upon the anticipated number of shares that were
required to fund the Companys ESOP, and employee stock purchase plan, through fiscal year 2006. The Company had repurchased 123,750 shares at an average cost of $1258 per share and 34,047 shares at an average cost of $1301 for the periods
ending December31, 2005 and December30, 2006, respectively. Of the 123,750 shares purchased in 2005, 97,500 were retired prior to December31, 2005. All remaining shares and purchases were retired during 2006. 16. EARNINGS PER SHARE The following table represents the

45  17. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS The Company has a defined contribution retirement plan covering substantially all of its eligible United States employees. Employer contributions under the retirement plan amounted to approximately $4,333, $2,573, and $2,452 during 2008,
2007, and 2006, respectively. The Company provides supplemental pension benefits to its employees of foreign operations in addition to mandatory benefits
included in local country payroll tax statutes. These supplemental pension benefits amounted to approximately $256, $348, and $425 during 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. In June 2004, the Companys Board of Directors approved the establishment of an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ESOPas the discretionary match portion of its 401k retirement plan. Prior to
2004, discretionary matches to the 401k plan were made in cash. The Company contributes to the ESOP for all eligible United States employees. Under the ESOP, which is 100% company funded, the Company allocates common stock to each participants
account. The allocation is generally a percentage of a participants compensation as determined by the Board of Directors on an annual basis. The ESOP is accounted for under Statement of Position 93-6 Employers Accounting for Employee
Stock Ownership Plans. The Company made annual contributions to the ESOP of 69,311 and 102,989 shares in January of 2008 and 2007, related to fiscal
years 2007 and 2006, respectively. Contributions were based on annual compensation. All shares receive regular quarterly dividends payable to the ESOP to cover plan expenses. In May 2008, the Board declared its first shared distribution dividend. The shared distribution dividend rewards employees through a contribution into their retirement accounts and concurrently rewards shareholders
with a special cash dividend. As a result of the shared distribution, the Company contributed 20,185 shares to the ESOP in May 2008. The Company incurred
retirement benefit expense under the ESOP of approximately $3,221, $1,498 and $1,407 during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 2008 amount includes both the 3% and 9% shared distributions announced in May 2008, and March 2009, respectively.
These amounts are included in the total employer contributions to the retirement plan noted above. As of January1, 2007, there were no restrictions
on the shares contributed to the ESOP. This allows participants to sell their shares to enable diversification within their individual 401k accounts. The Company does not have any repurchase obligations under the ESOP. During 2008, the Company developed plans for international employees to participate in the shared distributions. Three percent of 2008 wages was accrued for
international employees throughout the year. Additionally 9% of 2008 wages was accrued in accordance with the shared distribution announced in March 2009. The Companys foreign operations recognized total expense of approximately $753.
Employees will receive their first contributions in 2009. The Company awards deferred cash bonuses to key employees of its foreign operations. The
deferred cash bonuses are similar to phantom stock units, in that such bonuses are tied to the value of the Companys common stock. Awards are recognized over the deferral period as variable plan awards. The Company recognized approximately
$35, $539 and $219 of compensation expense in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to the awards. 18. SEGMENT REPORTING The individual subsidiaries comprising the Company operate predominantly in a single industry as manufacturers and distributors of hydraulic components. The Company is
multinational with operations in the United States, and subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Germany, Korea, and France. Amounts for France, due to their immateriality, are included with the U.S. In computing operating profit for the foreign
subsidiaries, no allocations of general corporate expenses have been made. Management bases its financial decisions by the geographical location of its operations.

legal proceedings other than routine litigation incidental to its business. In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect the results of operations, financial position or cash
flows of the Company. OPERATING LEASES The Company leases a manufacturing facility in Lenexa, Kansas and production support facilities in Sarasota,
Florida under operating leases having initial terms expiring between 2009 and 2010. The lease for the manufacturing facility in Kansas is expiring in May, 2009, and represents approximately 17,000 square feet of space. The lease for the production
support facilities in Florida is expiring in April, 2010, and represents approximately 10,000 square feet. Total rental expense for the years ended December27, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was approximately $236, $221 and $226, respectively.
47  Future minimum lease payments on operating leases are as follows:  2009 149
2010 33 Total minimum lease payments 182 INSURANCE The Company accrues for health care benefit costs under a self-funded plan. The Company purchases
re-insurance for both specific and aggregate stop losses on claims that exceed $115 on an individual basis and approximately $6,300 on an aggregate basis. The Company records a liability for all unresolved claims at the anticipated cost to the
Company at the end of the period based on managements assessment. The Company believes it has adequate reserves for all self-insurance claims. 20. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No157.
SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November15, 2007. In February2008, the FASB deferred the effective date of SFAS No157 until the fiscal year beginning after November15, 2008 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are
recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually. The partial adoption of SFAS No157 for financial assets and liabilities did not have a material effect on the Companys
Consolidated Financial Statements. The remaining requirements of SFAS 157 are not expected to have a material effect on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.

equity investment retained in a deconsolidation. SFASNo. 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFASNo. 160
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 160 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFASNo161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement
No133 SFAS 161. This statement amends SFASNo133 by requiring enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative instruments and hedging activities, but does not change SFASNo133s scope or
accounting. SFAS161 requires increased qualitative, quantitative and credit-risk disclosures about the entitys derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS161 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
fiscal years, beginning after November15, 2008, with earlier adoption permitted. The adoption of SFAS 161 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.

FASB Statement No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.SFAS 142 The intent of this FSP is to improve the consistency between
the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under FASB Statement No141 revised 2007, Business Combinations, and other U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles GAAP. FSP142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. The adoption of FSP 142-3 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial

Participating Securities, which addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per
share EPS under the two-class method described in paragraphs 60 and 61 of FASB Statement No128, Earnings per Share. FSP EITF 03-6-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008, and interim periods within

Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended as of the end of the
period covered by this report, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective and are designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the necessary
time periods. Our disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, are accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible

financial reporting during the quarter ended December27, 2008, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15f. The Companys internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded, as necessary, to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on the
criteria set forth in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation under the Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, management, with the
participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December27, 2008.
