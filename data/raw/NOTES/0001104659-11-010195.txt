Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of CIBER,Inc.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
aDescription of Business
CIBER is a global information technology IT consulting, services and outsourcing company applying practical innovation through services and solutions that deliver tangible results for both commercial and government clients. We compete in a large and growing marketplace offering services that include application development and management, enterprise resource planning ERP implementation, change management, project management, systems integration, infrastructure management and end-user computing, as well as strategic business and technology consulting. For more than 35 years, CIBER has been helping clients by understanding their goals, recommending the right solutions and delivering on our commitments. We primarily serve Global 2000 blue-chip companies and government agencies from our operations across 18 countries.
bPrinciples of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of CIBER,Inc. and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries together CIBER, the Company, we, our, or us. All material inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
The shares of our foreign subsidiaries that are owned by persons other than CIBER are referred to as noncontrolling interests in these Consolidated Financial Statements. The noncontrolling shareholders proportionate share of the equity of these subsidiaries is reflected as noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The noncontrolling shareholders proportionate share of the net income or loss of these subsidiaries is reflected as net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In accounting for the acquisition of a noncontrolling interest, any consideration paid in excess of the book value of the noncontrolling interest is recorded as a reduction of CIBER shareholders equity. In 2010, we purchased certain noncontrolling interests in foreign subsidiaries f
or cash of approximately $16 million. In2009, we issued 782,584 shares of our common stock, valued at approximately $24 million, in exchange for the noncontrolling interests in one of our foreign subsidiaries. In 2008, we paid $28 million to purchase certain noncontrolling interests in the same foreign subsidiary.
cUse of Estimates
The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
dRevenue Recognition
CIBER earns revenue primarily from providing IT services to its clients, and to a much lesser extent, from the sale and resale of IT hardware and software products. CIBERs consulting services revenue comes from three primary sources: 1technology integration services where we design, build and implement new or enhanced system applications and related processes; 2general IT consulting services, such as system selection or assessment, feasibility studies, training and staffing; and 3outsourcing and managed IT services in which we manage, staff, maintain, host or otherwise run solutions and/or systems provided to our customers. Contracts for these services have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, which requires management to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenue. Fees for these contracts m
ay be in the form of time-and-materials or fixed-price billings. The majority of our consulting services revenue is recognized under time-and-materials contracts as hours and costs are incurred. Consulting services revenue also includes project-related reimbursable expenses for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses separately billed to clients.
Revenue for technology integration consulting services where we design/redesign, build and implement new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for our clients is generally recognized based on the percentage-of-completion method. Under the percentage-of-completion method, management estimates the percentage of completion based upon the contract costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated contract costs. If the total cost estimate exceeds revenue, we accrue for the estimated loss immediately. The use of the percentage-of-completion method requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract revenue and costs, including assumptions as to the length of time to complete the project, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in estimated costs. Estimates of total contract costs
43 Table of Contents
are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenue and income and are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the periods in which they are first identified.
Revenue for general IT consulting services is recognized as work is performed and amounts are earned. We consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. For contracts with fees based on time-and-materials or cost-plus, we recognize revenue over the period of performance. For fixed-price contracts, depending on the specific contractual provisions and nature of the deliverables, revenue may be recognized on a proportional performance model based on level-of-effort, as milestones are achieved or when final deliverables have been provided.
Outsourcing and managed IT services arrangements typically span several years. Revenue from time-and-materials contracts is recognized as the services are performed. Revenue from unit-priced contracts is recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenue from fixed-price contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Costs related to delivering outsourcing and managed services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of labor and other direct costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period services are provided. Amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities, which do not have standalone value, are also deferred and recog
nized as revenue evenly over the period that the managed services are provided.
We sometimes enter into arrangements excluding software license arrangements with customers that purchase multiple services, or a combination of services and IT hardware products, from us at the same time, referred to as multiple-element arrangements. Each element within a multiple-element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided that the delivered services or products have value to the customer on a standalone basis. We consider a deliverable element to have standalone value if the service or product is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. For our multiple-element arrangements, the arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverable elements on the basis of their relative selling price the relative selling price method. When applying the relative selling 
price method, the selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE of selling price if it exists; otherwise, third-party evidence TPE of selling price is used. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists for a deliverable, then we use our best estimate of the selling price ESP for that deliverable when applying the relative selling price method. Since our services are typically customized to each clients specific needs, VSOE and TPE are generally not available. We determine ESP for purposes of allocating the arrangement by considering several external and internal factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices, margin objectives, competition, geographies in which we offer our products and services, and internal costs. As the result of new accounting guidance, we adopted the use of ESP in 2010 and this change was not material to our financial results. We limit the amount of reven
ue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional services or products.
Other revenue primarily includes resale of third-party IT hardware and software products, commissions on sales of IT products and, to a lesser extent, sales of proprietary software products. Revenue related to the sale of IT products is generally recognized when the products are shipped or if applicable, when delivered and installed in accordance with the terms of the sale. Where we are the re-marketer of certain IT products, commission revenue is recognized when the products are drop-shipped from the vendor to the customer. Our commission revenue represents the sales price to the customer less the cost paid to the vendor. Some software license arrangements also include implementation services and/or post-contract customer support. In such multi-element software arrangements, if the criteria are met, revenue is recognized based on the VSOE of the fair value of ea
ch element. If a software license arrangement containing multiple elements does not qualify for separate accounting for the implementation services, then the software license revenue and the related costs of third-party software products are generally recognized together with the software implementation services using the percentage-of-completion method. Revenue for software post-contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the related agreement.
Unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue based on services performed in advance of billings in accordance with contract terms. Under our typical time-and-materials billing arrangement, we bill our customers on a regularly scheduled basis, such as biweekly or monthly. At the end of each accounting period, we accrue revenue for services performed since the last billing cycle. These unbilled amounts are generally billed the following month. Unbilled accounts receivable also arise when percentage-of-completion accounting is used and costs plus estimated contract earnings exceed billings. Such amounts are billed at specific milestone dates or at contract completion. Management expects all unbilled accounts receivable to be collected within one year of the balance sheet date. Billings in excess of revenue recognized are recorded 
as deferred revenue and are primarily comprised of deferred software support revenue.

eCash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes bank demand and time deposits, money market funds and all other highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Substantially all of our cash balance at December31,2010 and 2009 was held by our foreign subsidiaries.
fAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We record accounts receivable at their face amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts. On a regular basis, we evaluate our client receivables, especially receivables that are past due, and we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific client collection issues.
gProperty and Equipment
Property and equipment, which primarily consists of computer equipment and software, furniture and leasehold improvements, is stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using straight-line and accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives, ranging primarily from three to seven years, or the related lease term, if shorter. Direct costs of time and materials incurred for the development of software for internal use are capitalized as property and equipment.
hLong-Lived Assets excluding Goodwill
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset.
iIncome Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax amounts are based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current and non-current amounts based on the financial statement classification of the related asset and liability. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. We use a two-step approach to recogni
ze and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. We first determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step involves measuring the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.
The provision for income taxes represents the estimated amounts for federal, state and foreign taxes. The determination of the provision for income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance requires us to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding possible outcomes and utilize estimates. As a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions where we operate. Our global operations are subject to complex tax regulations in numerous taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. We must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities wil
l be necessary. As a result, our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period. In addition, changes in the geographic mix and/or estimated levels of pre-tax income affect the overall effective tax rate. Interim-period tax expense is recorded based upon our best estimate of the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. Interest expense on tax liabilities is included in interest expense while any tax penalties are included in income tax expense.
jForeign Currency
The assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses arising from inter-company international transactions that are of a long-term investment nature are reported in the same manner as translation adjustments.
45 Table of Contents
All foreign currency transaction gains and losses, including foreign currency gains and losses on short-term inter-company loans and advances, are included in other income expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as incurred.
kShare-Based Compensation
We record share-based compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the estimated grant-date fair value of these awards, over the period the employees are required to provide services to earn the awards. Share-based compensation cost is recognized, as appropriate, in either cost of consulting services or in selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

mBusiness and Credit Concentrations
Financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk are cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Our cash and cash equivalents are in high-credit quality short-term investments and held by financial institutions. Accounts receivable are reviewed on a periodic basis and an allowance for bad debts is recorded where such amounts are determined to be uncollectible. We do not require collateral from our customers. Our revenue and accounts receivable are principally concentrated with large companies across several industries and governmental entities located throughout the United States and Europe.
nContingencies
We are routinely involved in legal proceedings, audits, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Although, the outcome of such matters is not predictable with assurance, we do not expect that the ultimate outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. However, depending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable outcome of any such matters could possibly materially affect our future results of operations or cash flow in any particular period.
2Acquisitions
We have acquired certain businesses, as set forth below, that we have accounted for using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations and, accordingly, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the results of operations of each acquired business since the date of acquisition.
Acquisitions 2010
In June2010, our International division acquired the assets of Denmark-based SAP consulting company Segmenta A/S Segmenta. The acquisition was completed to strengthen our European presence and expand our Danish operations. We paid $35 million in cash at closing and we may make a future cash payment contingent consideration at the end of the 36-month period ending on May31, 2013. The contingent consideration payment is based upon a multiple of the average annual earnings before interest and taxes achieved for the Segmenta business over the specified 36-month period. There is no limit to the amount that may be paid out. As part of our purchase price allocation, we recorded an initial liability of $42 million for the present value of the estimated contingent consideration. In allocating the purchase price based on estimated fair v
alues, we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of $71 million and $16 million, respectively, and recorded net liabilities of $10 million. We estimate the contingent consideration liability based on a probability-weighted approach derived from managements own estimates of profitability and sales targets. Changes in the estimated liability subsequent to the acquisition 
46 Table of Contents
date fair value, including interest charges, are recognized in earnings in the period in which the change occurs. If our earnings forecast increases or decreases by 20%, the estimate of undiscounted future consideration would range from $60 million to $90 million. At December31, 2010, the present value of the estimated contingent consideration liability was $51 million.
Acquisitions 2009
In January2009, we acquired Iteamic Private Ltd. Iteamic of Bangalore,India. Iteamic specialized in application development of offshore projects, primarily with companies in North America, and became part of our Custom Solutions division. The acquisition added leadership and delivery skills depth to our India Global Solutions Center. The purchase price was $47 million, and was allocated as follows: $08 million to net tangible assets acquired and $39 million to goodwill.
Acquisitions 2008
On April15, 2008, our International division acquired a Norwegian SAP consultancy for a total purchase price of $65 million. We paid cash of $48 million during 2008 and approximately $17 million is expected to be paid in the future. In connection with the acquisition, we recorded goodwill of $55 million and acquired other net assets of $10 million.

Dilutive securities are excluded from the diluted weighted average shares outstanding computation in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect, such as when we report a net loss or when stock options have an exercise price that is greater than the average market price of CIBER common stock during the period. The approximate average number of anti-dilutive securities omitted from the computation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 8,957,000, 9,149,000 and 6,256,000 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
4Executive Charges
On August2, 2010, we entered into an Executive Transition Agreement with our former President/Chief Executive Officer in connection with his separation from CIBER as its president and chief executive officer and his resignation as a director in April2010. Under this agreement, our former President/Chief Executive Officer remained a non-officer employee of CIBER through the end of 2010 to assist with certain management transition matters and continued to receive his base salary during this period. We have also agreed to: make cash payments to him in 2011 of $54 million; accelerate vesting on certain stock options and restricted stock units; and provide certain insurance and other miscellaneous benefits. Also in connection with the agreement, CIBER terminated his previous retirement plan agreement for which we had already accrued a liability of $19 million.
As a result, in the second quarter of 2010, we recorded a one-time pre-tax separation charge of $44 million, of which $05 million was non-cash stock compensation. During 2010, we paid out $03 million related to these accrued charges, leaving an accrued liability balance of $55 million at December31,2010, which is included in other accrued expenses and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
47 Table of Contents
In connection with the change in our non-executive Chairman of our Board of Directors in April2010, we also accrued $06 million during the second quarter of 2010, for our current estimated value of benefits to be provided to our Founder and former non-executive Chairman of the Board. The related accrued liability balance at December31, 2010, was $04 million.

7Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
We perform our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of June30 each year or more often if there are indicators of impairment present. We test each of our reporting units for goodwill impairment. Our reporting units are the same as our operating divisions and reporting segments. The goodwill impairment test requires a two-step process. The first step consists of comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then it is not considered impaired and no further analysis is required. If step one indicates that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then impairment potentially exists and the second step is performed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment. Goodwill impairmen
t exists when the estimated implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying value.
48 Table of Contents
We compared the carrying value of each of our five reporting units to its estimated fair value at June30, 2010. We estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units based on a weighting of both the income approach and the market approach. The discounted cash flows for each reporting unit that served as the primary basis for the income approach were based on discrete financial forecasts developed by management. Cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period of five years were estimated using the perpetuity growth method calculation. The average annualrevenue growth rates forecasted for each reporting unit for the first five years of our projections ranged between 5% and 20%, with an overall weighted average of 7%. We project operating profit margins to return to historical norms by 2012 in the individual reporting units as we expect the IT indust
ry to recover over the next few years, and we expect to obtain margin benefits from a number of internal initiatives. The terminal value was calculated assuming projected growth rates of 3% after five years, which reflects our estimate of minimum long-term growth in IT spending. The income approach valuations also included reporting unit cash flow discount rates, which represented each reporting units estimated weighted average cost of capital and ranged from 12% to 14%. The market approach applied pricing multiples derived from publicly-traded companies that are comparable to the respective reporting unit to determine its value. We utilized enterprise value/revenue multiples ranging from 03 to 07 and enterprise value/EBITDA multiples ranging from 42 to 68 in order to value each of our reporting units under the market approach. Also, the fair value under the market approach included a control premium of 30%. The control premium was determined based on a review of
comparative market transactions. Publicly-available information regarding our market capitalization was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the cumulative fair values of our reporting units.
As a result of the first step of our goodwill impairment test as of June30, 2010, we estimated that the fair value for our International, U.S. ERP and IT Outsourcing reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by 79%, 31% and 41%, respectively, thus no impairment was indicated. We also determined that the estimated fair values of our Custom Solutions and Federal reporting units were less than their respective carrying amounts by 3% and 23%, respectively, indicating impairment may exist for these divisions.
Because indicators of impairment existed for our Custom Solutions and Federal reporting units, we performed the second step of the test to determine the implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit. The estimated implied fair value of goodwill was determined in a consistent manner utilized to estimate the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. As a result, we calculated the estimated fair value of certain non-recorded assets, including customer relationships and trade name. The implied fair value of goodwill was measured as the excess of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities. The impairment loss for each reporting unit was measured by the amount that the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill. Based on this assessment, we recorded an i
mpairment charge of $1120 million $820 million for Custom Solutions and $300 million for Federal in 2010, which represented 50% of the Custom Solutions and and 40% of the Federal reporting units goodwill prior to the impairment charge, respectively.
The impairment charge is primarily a result of the impact that the depressed economic environment had on overall equity values and its negative impact on our operations and forecasted cash flows, as well as the sustained decline in our market capitalization. We have adjusted our forecasted cash flows and the other assumptions used to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units to account for our beliefs and expectations of the current macro-economic environment. While we believe our estimates are appropriate based on our view of current business trends, no assurance can be provided that additional impairment charges will not be required in the future.

We are engaged in legal proceedings in Germany with certain former minority shareholders of Novasoft AG now known as CIBER AG, which we acquired a controlling interest in during 2004. In August2006, we completed a buy-out of the remaining minority shareholders of Novasoft; however, certain of those former minority shareholders challenged the adequacy of the buy-out consideration in a German court. The court appointed independent experts to evaluate the consideration and claims of the minority shareholders. At this time, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings, although if the court awards additional consideration, such consideration will increase the goodwill associated with the acquisition.

9Borrowings
Senior Credit Facility CIBER has a senior credit agreement with several financial institutions as lenders and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent the Senior Credit Facility that matures on August20, 2012. The credit available under the Senior Credit Facility may be used for the working capital needs and general corporate purposes of the Company. The Senior Credit Facility provides for an $85 million revolving line of credit and a term loan. The term loan balance at December31,2010, was $375 million. The term loan requires quarterly principal reductions of $25 million, and therefore $10 million of our total obligation is classified as a current liability. CIBERs remaining obligation under the Senior Credit Facility is classified as long
- -term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Senior Credit Facility was subsequently amended on February18, 2011, to modify certain financial covenants effective as of December31, 2010, as well as modify other provisions.
The Senior Credit Facility is subject to mandatory prepayments and commitment reductions in amounts equal to the net cash proceeds of any asset disposition, event of loss, extraordinary receipts, issuance or incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of equity, subject in each case as appropriate to thresholds and other exceptions and definitions as specified in the credit agreement. CIBERs obligations under the Senior Credit Facility are secured by all of CIBERs present and future domestic tangible and intangible assets, as well as a pledge of 66% of the capital stock of CIBERs direct foreign subsidiaries.
Subject to applicable conditions, we may elect interest rates on our Senior Credit Facility borrowings calculated by reference to either the Bank of America prime lending rate Prime plus a margin that ranges from 175% to 250%, or a London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR for one, three or six month maturities, plus a margin that ranges from 275% to 350%. The applicable margins on our Prime loans and LIBOR loans are determined by reference to our current consolidated total leverage ratio. We are also required to pay a commitment fee of 050% per annum on the unused portion of the Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility and the related loan documents provide for the payment of other specified recurring fees and expenses, including administrative agent fees, letter of credit and other fees. We currently have an interest rate swap tha
t matures on March31, 2012, which converts $250 million of our borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility from a variable-rate instrument into a 177% fixed-rate instrument, plus the applicable margin. At December31,2010, our weighted average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility, including the interest swap, was 417%.
The terms of the Senior Credit Facility, as amended, include among other provisions, specific limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, stock repurchases, investments, guarantees, mergers, dispositions and acquisitions, and a prohibition on the payment of any dividends. The Senior Credit Facility also contains certain financial covenants, including: 1 a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio; 2 a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio; 3 a minimum EBITDA; and 4 an asset coverage test.
Total upfront and arrangement fees and related expenses for completing the Senior Credit Facility in 2009, as well as any subsequent amendment fees are typically amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the credit agreement.
At December31,2010, we had outstanding borrowings of $872 million under the Senior Credit Facility. We are required to be in compliance with the financial covenants at the end of each calendar quarter, and we were in compliance with these financial covenants as of December31,2010.

10Financial Instruments
We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value i.e., gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. All hedging instruments must be designated, based on the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
CIBER is exposed to certain risks related to its ongoing business operations. From time to time, CIBER may choose to use derivative instruments to manage certain risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the effective hedge portion of the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The gain or loss is classified in the same statement of operations line item as the associated item being hedged.
We have entered into an interest rate swap with a financial institution, for which we have elected hedge accounting and have designated it as a cash flow hedge. This interest rate swap helps us manage our interest rate risk under our Senior Credit Facility by converting a portion of our floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis, thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. This agreement involves the receipt of floating-rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreement without any exchange of underlying principal amounts. Interest is net settled monthly with the financial institution counterparty. The interest rate swap, which matures on March31, 2012, converts $250 million of our borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility from a variable-rate instrument into a fixed-rate instrument at 177% plus our
current credit margin of 325% at December31,2010, for a total rate of 502%. At December31,2010, the estimated unrealized loss on our interest rate swap, net of taxes of $174,000, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income was approximately $284,000. The liability for the unrealized loss on the swap of $458,000 is presented with other accrued expenses and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is expected to be recognized in earnings over the remaining term of the swap.
From time to time, CIBER will also enter into foreign currency forward contracts related to customer agreements or intercompany transactions denominated in a foreign currency or related to certain forecasted foreign operating results. We generally have not elected hedge accounting for these derivatives. At December31,2010 and 2009, we did not have any material outstanding foreign currency forward contracts.

We are required to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets, taking into consideration our forecast of future taxable income, the reversal of other existing temporary differences, available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, we must evaluate the need for, and amount of, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances will be required. Based on our evaluation of current and anticipated future taxable income, we believe sufficient taxable income will be generated to realize the net deferred tax assets.
At December31,2010, we have approximately $22 million of NOL carryforwards for U.S. tax purposes. Of this total, $3 million of U.S. NOL carryforwards are subject to annual usage limitations under U.S. tax rules; however, they do not begin to expire until 2022. The remaining U.S. NOLs do not begin to expire until 2030. Our Federal tax credit carryforwards are subject to annual usage limits but do not begin to expire until 2025. There is no valuation allowance for our U.S. NOL and Federal tax credit carryforwards as we expect to fully utilize them. At December31,2010, we also have approximately $35 million of foreign NOL carryforwards. We have recorded a valuation allowance for approximately 85% of the foreign NOL carryforwards, as we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will utilize them. Less than 30% of the 
foreign NOL carryforwards may expire. The net change in the total valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was a decrease of $32,000 in 2010 and an increase of $18 million in 2009.
We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, as we consider these to be permanently reinvested in the operations of such subsidiaries. At December31,2010, these undistributed earnings totaled approximately $205 million. If some of these earnings were distributed, some countries may impose withholding taxes. In addition, as foreign taxes have previously been paid on these earnings, we would expect to be entitled to a U.S. foreign tax credit that would reduce the U.S. taxes owed on such distribution. As such, it is not practicable to determine the net amount of the related unrecognized U.S. deferred tax liability.
A portion of the operations of our India subsidiary are not subject to taxes under a tax holiday that expires in 2011. The income tax benefit attributable to this tax holiday was approximately $11 million, $05 million and $04 million in 2010, 2009
54 Table of Contents
and 2008, respectively.
We account for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when based upon the technical merits, it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination. The changes in the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits were as follows

Our unrecognized tax benefits totaled $74 million at December31,2010. If recognized, these benefits would affect our effective tax rate. It is reasonably possible that the total of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by as much as $3 million as a result of settlement with the tax authorities or expiration of the statute of limitations within the next 12 months. Any settlement amount is likely to differ from the amount of the related unrecognized tax benefit as previously estimated, and such difference would affect our effective tax rate.
We file a U.S. Federal income tax return and tax returns in nearly all U.S. states, as well as in numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are routinely subject to examination by various domestic and foreign tax authorities. The outcome of tax audits is always uncertain and could result in cash tax payments that could be material. Additionally, tax audits may take long periods of time to ultimately resolve. We do not believe the outcome of any tax audits at December31,2010, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Our U.S. Federal income tax returns dating back to 2007 are open to possible examination. We currently have a tax audit in process in the Netherlands related to the years since 2004. Our most significant foreign operations and the most recent year for which they are no longer 
subject to tax examination are as follows: Germany-2007; India-2003; Netherlands-2004; Norway-2000; and the UK-2008.
12 Fair Value Measurements
The Company is required to disclose the fair value of all assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurement and the nature of the valuation techniques, including their classification within the fair value hierarchy, utilized by the Company in performing these measurements.
The FASB provides a fair value framework which requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions or inputs used to price the assets or liabilities, which are as follows Level  1:  
Unadjusted  quoted pricesin active markets for identical assets or liabilities.      
Level  2:  
Unadjusted  quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or  unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in  markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are  observable for the asset or liability.      
Level  3:  
Unobservable  inputs for the asset or liability that reflect the reporting entitys own  assumptions.

The fair values of these financial liabilities are recorded in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The carrying values of our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature. The fair value of derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps is determined utilizing market-based information such as LIBOR-based yield curves. Our interest rate swap matures on March31, 2012, and converts $250 million of our borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility from a variable-rate instrument into a 177% fixed-rate instrument, plus the applicable margin. The book values of the borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility and our other bank debt approximate their fair values due to their interest rates approximating current market rates.
The estimated fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration was based on a probability-weighted approach derived from managements own estimates of profitability and sales targets, as well as the discount rate of 15% used to determine the present value of the liability. There has been no change to managements estimates of profitability and sales targets between the acquisition date and December31,2010, and the value of the liability changed by $09 million related to $05 million of interest charges and $04 million of foreign-exchange adjustments, which have been recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.
The fair value of our reporting units utilized in our annual goodwill impairment assessment, which utilizes unobservable inputs that reflect managements own assumptions, is discussed in Note 7.
13401kSavings Plan
Almost all of our U.S. employees are eligible to participate in our 401ksavings plan. We match a portion of the employees contribution. Beginning in 2009, the Companys match was reduced to a maximum of one and one-half percent of an employees compensation, with a limit of $1,500 per calendar year, from a maximum of three percent of an employees contribution, with a $3,000 limit per calendar year in 2008. Vesting in CIBERs matching contribution occurs over six years. Forfeitures reduce our matching contributions. We record forfeitures when a participants employment ends. We recorded expense of $15 million, $14 million and $48 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to this plan.
14Shareholders Equity
Share-Based Compensation On April27, 2004, our shareholders approved the adoption of the CIBER,Inc. 2004 Incentive Plan the 2004 Plan. To date, 10,000,000 shares of CIBER,Inc. common stock have been authorized for issuance under the 2004 Plan. The plan administrators may grant restricted stock, stock options, performance units or any combination thereof, to officers, employees and consultants. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines the number, nature and vesting of such awards. As of December31,2010, there are approximately 3,023,000 shares available for future grants under the 2004 Plan.
The 2004 Plan also implements a formula award plan for non-employee directors. Under the formula plan and effective until December31, 2009, each non-employee director received a non-statutory option to purchase 20,000 shares of common stock upon election to the Board of Directors and an option to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock on each anniversary of election to the Board of Directors. On February23, 2010, a one-time grant of $50,000 in Company common stock was granted to non-employee directors as of that date. Such common stock grant vested quarterly beginning on the date of the grant and continuing for the next three calendar quarters at 90 day intervals. Prior to October1, 2009, non-employee directors received shares of CIBER common stock as compensation for attending Board, Annual and committee meetings, as well as for serving as committee c
hairpersons. Subsequent to October1, 2009, non-employee directors instead receive cash payments for above-mentioned purposes. Compensation expense for grants of common stock to non-employee directors was $300,000, $131,000 and $153,000 for the years ended December31,2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and is included in our total recorded share-based compensation costs.

In July2010, CIBER made an inducement grant of 1,400,000 CIBER stock options to our new president and chief executive officer with an exercise price equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of issuance. These options were granted outside of the 2004 Plan. These options are subject to graded vesting over four years and expire after seven years.

Options granted under the 2004 Plan generally have an exercise price that is at least equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of issuance. Options currently being granted under the 2004 Plan are subject to cliff or graded vesting or performance-based conditions in combination with graded vesting. Graded vesting generally ranges from one to four years, as determined at the date of grant by the Board of Directors, with the exception of some options granted to employees of our International division, which may be fully vested on the grant date. Additionally, options granted under the 2004 Plan have contractual terms ranging from four to 10 years, but all 2004 Plan options must expire no later than 10 years from the grant date. Options granted during 2010 and 2009 under the 2004 Plan had contractual terms of five years.
The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing method. Compensation costs related to options with graded vesting are recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The expected life for options with a contractual life of 10 years is derived from historical data pertaining to option exercises and employee terminations. The expected life for options with a contractual life of less than 10 years is derived using the SECs simplified method, as we did not have sufficient historical data pertaining to options with contractual lives of less than 10 years upon which to base an expected term assumption. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our common stock. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant a
nd the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes.

Restricted stock units RSUs currently being granted under the 2004 Plan are generally subject to vesting over a period of three years, varying from graded vesting or performance-based conditions in combination with graded vesting, as well as other possible vesting schedules as determined at the date of grant by the Board of Directors. The fair value of the RSUs, equivalent to the Companys stock price at the date of grant, is expensed over the vesting term.

As of December31,2010, there was approximately $49 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the nonvested stock options and RSUs disclosed in the tables above. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 24 years.
At December31,2010, there were approximately 13,241,000 shares of CIBER common stock reserved for share-based awards outstanding and available future grants under our share-based plans.
Through December31, 2010, our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, which is a non-qualified plan, allowed eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value on the first or last day of the applicable offering period, which is equal to three months. Under this plan, substantially all employees may elect to contribute up to $6,000 of their compensation during one calendar year. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, we issued approximately 1,060,000, 1,030,000 and 475,000 shares, respectively, under our ESPP and the related compensation cost recorded was approximately $814,000 for 2010, $900,000 for 2009 and $740,000 for 2008. We modified our ESPP such that beginning in 2011, eligible employees will be allowed to purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal to 95% of fair market value on the last 
day of the applicable three-month offering period. Due to these changes, the Company will have no related compensation cost for our ESPP in 2011.

Sale of Common Stock During the year ended December31, 2009, we sold nine million shares of our common stock, for proceeds of $232 million, net of issuance costs, which were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our then-outstanding senior secured reducing revolving credit facility.
Repurchase Program CIBER has had a common stock share repurchase program since 1999 that has been amended from time to time by our Board of Directors to increase the authorized shares available for repurchase. Under the most recent authorization in October2009, the Board approved an additional $5 million for future repurchases of our common stock. Under the program in 2010, we repurchased approximately 656,000 shares of common stock at a cost of $24 million. At December31,2010, there was approximately $31 million remaining for future repurchases under this program, however, the Company is currently not permitted to make additional repurchases under the terms of our amended Senior Credit Facility.
Shelf Registration Statements on FormS-4 At December31,2010, we have two effective registration statements on FormS-4, under which together approximately 13,469,000 shares of our common stock remain available. The shares available under either one of these registration statements may be used by CIBER from time to time in connection with future business combinations.
Shelf Registration Statement on FormS-3 At December31,2010, we have an effective registration statement on FormS-3, under which up to $100 million of debt securities, shares of our common stock, shares of our preferred stock and warrants may be sold in the future. This registration statement enables us to raise funds from the offering of such instruments described above from time to time, subject to market conditions and our capital needs.
Stock Purchase Rights Pursuant to our Rights Agreement, dated August31, 1998, CIBER,Inc. paid a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right a Right for each outstanding share of CIBER,Inc. common stock Common Stock on September21, 1998. A Right is also attached to all shares of Common Stock issued after the dividend date. On May2, 2008, we amended and restated our original Rights Agreement. Under the Amended Rights Agreement, each shareholder of the Company holds one Right for each share of Common Stock held. The Rights generally become exercisable only in the event that an acquiring party accumulates 15% or more of our outstanding Common Stock. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase one one-thousandth of a sh
are of SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock of CIBER,Inc., par value $001, at a purchase price of thirty-seven dollars, subject to the conditions set forth in the Amended Rights Agreement. If this were to occur, subject to certain exceptions, each Right except for the Rights held by the acquiring party would allow its holder to purchase Common Stock with a value equal to twice the exercise price of the Right. In the event that, after an acquiring party has accumulated 15% or more of our outstanding Common Stock, the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction or 50% or more of its consolidated assets, cash flow or earning power are sold, each unexercised Right except for the Rights held by the acquiring party would thereafter allow its holder to purchase stock of the acquiring company or our Common Stock if it is the surviving company to the transaction with a value equal to twice the purchase price of the Right. If the Rights were fu
lly exercised, the shares issued would cause substantial dilution to the acquiring party or the shareholders of the acquiring company. The Amended Rights Agreement provides a period of time during which we may redeem the Rights, in whole or in part at a price of $0001 per Right, such that this period will end on the earlier of ithe tenth business day following the date a person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the Common Stock or iithe final expiration date of the Rights, which is May2, 2018.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures - During the fiscal period covered by this report, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules13a-15eand 15d-15eof the Exchange Act. Based upon this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is 1recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
Securities and Exchange Commission rulesand forms, and 2accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting - Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. CIBERs internal control systems were designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement p
reparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2010, based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31,2010.
The attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2010, issued by Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited our consolidated financial statements, is included following this Item 9A.
Changes in Internal Controls - There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
We continue to monitor the effectiveness of our internal controls and make necessary modifications to our processes and testing as appropriate on an on-going basis.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of CIBER,Inc.
We have audited CIBER,Inc. and subsidiaries the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2010, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2010, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December31,2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31,2010 of the Company and our report dated February25, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
