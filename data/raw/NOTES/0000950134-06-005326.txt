41 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders Packeteer, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting appearing under Item9Ab, that
Packeteer, Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, because of the
effect of a material weakness identified in managements
assessment, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. Management of Packeteer, Inc. is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in a more than remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The
following material weakness has been identified and included in
managements assessment as of December31, 2005: the
Company did not maintain effective controls over: ithe
reconciliation of the income tax accounts to the supporting
schedules, and iithe review of the income tax account
reconciliation by someone other than the preparer. These
deficiencies resulted in a material misstatement of the
Companys income tax provision. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of Packeteer, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December31, 2005. The
aforementioned material weakness was considered in determining
the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our
audit of the 2005 consolidated financial statements, and this
report does not affect our report dated March15, 2006,
which expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements. 42 Table of Contents In our opinion, managements assessment that Packeteer,
Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. Also, in our opinion, because of the effect of the
material weakness described above on the achievement of the
objectives of the control criteria, Packeteer, Inc. has not
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO.   
/s/ KPMG LLP
Mountain View, California March15, 2006 43 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders Packeteer, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Packeteer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2005
and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders equity and comprehensive income and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2005. These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Packeteer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2005, in conformity
with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of Packeteer, Inc.s internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report
dated March15, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of, and an adverse opinion on the
effective operation of, internal control over financial
reporting.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES   
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Packeteer, Inc., along with its subsidiaries collectively
referred to herein as the Company,
Packeteer, we and us
provides WAN Application Optimization systems designed to
deliver a broad set of visibility, control, compression and
protocol acceleration capabilities to enterprise customers and
service providers. For enterprise customers, Packeteer systems
are designed to enable IT organizations to effectively optimize
application and network resources, while providing measurable
cost savings in wide area network, or WAN, investments. For
service providers, Packeteer systems are designed to provide a
platform for delivering application-intelligent network services
that control quality of service, or QoS, expand revenue
opportunities and offer compelling differentiation from other
potential solutions. The Company was incorporated on
January25, 1996, and commenced principal operations in
1997, at which time the Company began selling its products and
related services. The Company currently markets and distributes
its products via a worldwide network of resellers, distributors
and systems integrators.   
BASIS OF PREPARATION The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.   
USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On
an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those
related to inventory valuation, valuation of long-lived assets,
valuation allowances including sales return and rebate reserves
and allowance for doubtful accounts, and other liabilities,
specifically warranty reserves. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.   
REVENUE RECOGNITION Product revenues consist primarily of sales of our PacketShaper
products, which include hardware, as well as software licenses,
to distributors and resellers. Service revenues consist
primarily of maintenance revenue and, to a lesser extent,
training revenue. We apply the provisions of Statement of Position, or SOP,
97-2, Software
Revenue Recognition, as amended by
SOP98-9,
Modification of
SOP97-2, Software
Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions,
to all transactions involving the sale of hardware and software
products. Revenue is generally recognized when all of the
following criteria are met, as set forth in paragraph8 of
SOP97-2   
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists     
delivery has occurred     
the fee is fixed or determinable,and     
collectibility is probable. Receipt of a customer purchase order is persuasive evidence of
an arrangement. Sales through our distribution channel are
evidenced by an agreement governing the relationship together
with purchase orders on a transaction-by-transaction basis. 49 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common
carrier from Packeteer or its designated fulfillment house. For
certain destinations outside the Americas, delivery occurs when
product is delivered to the destination country. For maintenance
contracts, delivery is deemed to occur ratably over the contract
period. Our fees are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at
the inception of an arrangement and are negotiated at the outset
of an arrangement, generally based on specific products and
quantities to be delivered. In the event payment terms are
provided that differ significantly from our standard business
practices, which are generally ninety days or less, the fees are
deemed to not be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized
as the fees become due and payable. We assess collectibility based on a number of factors, including
credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history
of the customer. Generally, product revenue is recognized upon delivery. However,
product revenue on sales to major new distributors are recorded
based on sell-through to the end user customers until such time
as we have established significant experience with the
distributors product exchange activity. Additionally, when
we introduce new product into our distribution channel for which
there is no historical customer demand or acceptance history,
revenue is recognized on the basis of sell-through to end user
customers until such time as demand or acceptance history has
been established. We defer recognition of revenue on inventory in the distribution
channel in excess of a certain number of days. On the same
basis, we reduce the associated cost of revenues, which is
primarily related to materials, and include this amount in
inventory. We recognize these revenues and associated cost of
revenues when the inventory levels no longer exceed expected
supply. No amounts were deferred under this policy as of
December31, 2005 or December31, 2004. We have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple
element arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient
vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value to
allocate revenue to the maintenance component of our product and
to training. VSOE of fair value is based upon separate sales of
maintenance renewals and training to customers. Accordingly,
assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met, revenue
from product sales is recognized upon delivery using the
residual method in accordance with SOP98-9. Revenue from
maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term and
revenue from training is recognized when the training has taken
place. To date, training revenues have not been material.   
SALES RETURN RESERVES Management makes estimates of potential future product returns
related to current period product revenue in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS48,
Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists.
These sales return reserves are recorded as a reduction to
revenue. The Companys estimate for sales returns is based
on its historical return rates and is recorded against accounts
receivable. The following provides additional details on the sales return
reserves in thousands

REBATE RESERVES Certain distributors and resellers can earn rebates under
several Packeteer programs. The rebates earned are recorded in
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF01-9,
Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
Customer Including a Reseller of the Vendors Products.
For established programs, the Companys estimates for
rebates are based on historical usage rates. For new programs,
rebate reserves are calculated to cover the Companys
maximum exposure until such time as historical usage rates are
developed. When sufficient historical experience is established,
there may be a reversal of previously accrued rebates if actual
rebate claims are less than the maximum exposure. Additionally,
there may be a reversal of previously accrued rebate reserves if
rebates are not claimed before the expiration dates established
for each program. Rebate reserves at December31, 2005 and
2004 were $16million and $18million, respectively,
and are included in other accrued liabilities.   
ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The allowance for doubtful accounts reduces trade receivables to
their net realizable value. When evaluating the adequacy of the
allowance for doubtful accounts, management reviews the aged
receivables on an account-by-account basis, taking into
consideration such factors as the age of the receivables,
customer history and estimated continued credit-worthiness, as
well as general economic and industry trends. The following provides additional details on the allowance for
doubtful accounts in thousands

COST OF REVENUES Our cost of revenues consists of the cost of finished products
purchased from our contract manufacturers, overhead costs,
service support costs and amortization of purchased intangible
assets. The Company provides currently for the estimated costs
that may be incurred under product warranties when products are
shipped.   
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase
to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist
primarily of cash on deposit with banks, money market
instruments and investments in commercial paper that are stated
at cost, which approximates fair market value.   
INVESTMENTS Management determines the appropriate classification of
investment securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates
such designation as of each balance sheet date. As of
December31, 2005 and 2004, all investment securities are
designated as available-for-sale. These
available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value based on
quoted market prices, with the unrealized gains losses
reported as a separate component of stockholders equity.
The Company periodically reviews the realizable value of its
investments in marketable securities. When assessing marketable
securities for other-than temporary declines in value, we
consider such factors as the length of time and extent to which
fair value has been less than the cost basis, the market outlook
in general and the Companys intent and ability to hold the
investment for a period of time 51 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market
value. If an other-than-temporary impairment of the investments
is deemed to exist, the carrying value of the investment would
be written down to its estimated fair value.   
INVENTORIES Inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are stated
at the lower of cost on a
first-in, first-out
basis or market. We record inventory write-downs for excess and
obsolete inventories based on historical usage and forecasted
demand. If future demand or market conditions are less favorable
than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be
required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period
the revision is made. Inventories consisted of the following at December31 in

LONG-LIVED ASSETS Property and equipment, including equipment acquired
under capital lease, are recorded at cost. Depreciation and
amortization are provided using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally
18months to four years. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the shorter of estimated useful lives of the
assets or the lease term, generally five years. During 2004, the
remaining leases were fully paid and the equipment under capital
lease was transferred to computers and equipment. Property and equipment consisted of the following at

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the

acquisition date. Goodwill of $95million was recorded in
connection with the acquisition of Mentat, Inc., or Mentat, in
December 2004. Other intangibles include purchased intangibles recorded
in connection with the acquisition of Mentat. Estimated useful
lives are five years for developed technology, three years for
tradename and six years for customer contracts and relationships. 52 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on December1 in
a two-step process. First, the Company determines if the
carrying amount of its Reporting Unit exceeds the fair
value of the Reporting Unit, which would indicate that
goodwill may be impaired. If the Company determines that
goodwill may be impaired, the Company compares the implied
fair value of the goodwill, as defined by SFAS142,
to its carrying amount to determine if there is an impairment
loss. The Company does not have any goodwill that it considers
to be impaired. In accordance with SFAS144, Accounting for
Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets, the Company
evaluates long-lived assets, including intangible assets other
than goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may
not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured
by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future
undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If
the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any
impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying
value and the fair value of the impaired asset.   
ADVERTISING AND SALES PROMOTION COSTS Advertising and sales promotion costs are expensed as incurred
and the amounts were not material for all periods presented.   
WARRANTY RESERVES Upon shipment of products to its customers, the Company provides
for the estimated cost to repair or replace products that may be
returned under warranty. The Companys warranty period is
typically 12months from the date of shipment to the end
user customer. For existing products, the reserve is estimated
based on actual historical experience. For new products, the
required reserve is based on historical experience of similar 53 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued products until such time as sufficient historical data has been
collected on the new product and is included in other accrued
liabilities. The following provides a reconciliation of changes in

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS Development costs incurred in the research and development of
new products, other than software, and enhancements to existing
products are expensed as incurred. Costs for the development of
new software products and enhancements to existing products are
expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been
established, at which time any additional development costs
would be capitalized in accordance with SFAS86,
Accounting for Costs of Computer Software To Be Sold,
Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. To date, the Companys
software has been available for general release shortly after
the establishment of technological feasibility, which the
Company defines as a working prototype and, accordingly,
capitalizable costs have not been material.   
CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash, cash
equivalents, investments and accounts receivable. The
Companys cash, cash equivalents and investments are
maintained with highly accredited financial institutions and
investments are placed with high quality issuers. The Company
believes no significant concentration of credit risk exists with
respect to these financial instruments. Credit risk with respect
to trade receivables are limited as the Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers. Based on managements
evaluation of potential credit losses, the Company believes its
allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate. A limited number of indirect channel partners have accounted for
a large part of our revenues to date and we expect that this
trend will continue. In 2005, sales to Alternative Technology,
Inc. and Westcon, Inc. accounted for 22% and 13% of net
revenues, respectively. In 2004, sales to the same two customers
accounted for 22% and 19% of net revenues, respectively. In
2003, sales to Alternative Technology, Inc., Westcon, Inc. and
Macnica, Inc. accounted for 22%, 14% and 10% of net revenues,
respectively. All of these customers are distributors, who in
turn sell to large numbers of value-added resellers, system
integrators and other resellers. At December31, 2005, two
customers, Alternative Technologies, Inc. and Westcon, Inc.,
accounted for 20% and 13% of gross accounts receivable,
respectively. We principally rely on one contract manufacturer for all of our
manufacturing requirements. Any manufacturing disruption could
impair our ability to fulfill orders. Our reliance on this
third-party manufacturer for all our manufacturing requirements
could cause us to lose orders if this third-party manufacturer
fails to satisfy our cost, quality and delivery requirements.   
INCOME TAXES The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting
for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax 54 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are to be recovered
or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of
a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax
assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for
any tax benefits of which future realization is uncertain.   
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION As permitted under SFAS123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, and SFAS148,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Transition and Disclosure, Packeteer has elected to
continue to follow the intrinsic value method in accordance with
APB25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, in accounting for its stock-based employee
compensation arrangements. During 2005 and 2004, stock-based
compensation of $901,000 and $14,000, respectively, related to
the issuance of restricted shares in connection with the Mentat
acquisition, was included in compensation expense. The following
table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS The Companys sales to international customers are
U.S.dollar-denominated. As a result, there are no foreign
currency gains or losses related to these transactions. The functional currency for the Companys foreign
subsidiaries is the U.S.dollar. Accordingly, the entities
remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at period-end exchange
rates, while non-monetary items are remeasured at historical
rates. Income and expense accounts are remeasured at the average
rates in effect during the year. Remeasurement adjustments are
recognized in income as transaction gains or losses in the year
of occurrence. To date, the effect of such amounts on net income
has not been significant.   
OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS The Company reports comprehensive income or loss in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income. SFAS130 establishes standards
for reporting comprehensive income and loss and its components
in financial statements. For the Company, the difference between
reported net income loss and comprehensive income loss is
due to unrealized gains or losses on securities available for
sale. Tax effects of the components of other comprehensive
income loss are not considered material for any periods
presented.   
NET INCOME PER SHARE Basic net income per share has been computed using the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the
period, less the weighted-average number of common shares that
are subject to repurchase. Diluted net income per share has been

potential common shares outstanding during the period. 56 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS123R, Share
Based Payments, which the Company will adopt in the first
quarter of 2006. SFAS123R will result in the recognition
of substantial compensation expense relating to our employee
stock option and employee stock purchase plans. The Company
currently uses the intrinsic value method to measure
compensation expense for stock-based awards to its employees.
Under this standard, the Company generally does not recognize
any compensation related to stock option grants the Company
issues under its stock option plan or related to the discounts
the Company provides under its employee stock purchase plan.
Under the new rules, the Company is required to adopt one of the
fair-value-based methods for measuring the compensation expense
related to employee stock awards. This will lead to substantial
additional compensation expense. The rules also require the
Company to select one of two transition methods, retrospective
application or prospective application. The Company will
recognize stock-based compensation expense on all awards using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model and adopt
SFAS123R using the modified prospective method. The
paragraph entitled STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION included in
note1 to these consolidated financial statements provides
the pro forma net income and earnings per share as if the
Company had used a fair-value-based method similar to the
methods required 57 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued under SFAS123R to measure the compensation expense for
employee stock awards during the three years ended
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS153, Exchanges
of Nonmonetary Assets An Amendment of APB Opinion
No29. The amendments made by SFAS153 are
based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets
should be measured based on the fair value of the assets
exchanged. Further, the amendment eliminates the narrow
exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets
and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of
nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial
substance. The provisions in SFAS153 are effective
for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods
beginning after June15, 2005. Adoption of this standard on
July1, 2005 did not have a material impact on the
Companys financial position or results of operations. On March29, 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
BulletinNo107 SAB107 regarding the
Staffs interpretation of Share-Based Payments. This
interpretation expresses the views of the staff regarding the
interaction between SFAS123R and certain SEC rules and
regulations and provides the staffs views regarding the
valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public
companies. In particular, this SAB provides guidance related to
share-based payment transactions with non-employees, the
transition from nonpublic to public entity status, valuation
methods, the accounting for certain redeemable financial
instruments issued under share-based payment arrangements, the
classification of compensation expense, non-GAAP financial
measures, first-time adoption of SFAS123R in an interim
period, capitalization of compensation cost related to
share-based payment arrangements, the accounting for income tax
effects of share-based payment arrangements upon adoption of
SFAS123R, the modification of employee share options
prior to adoption of Statement123R and disclosures in
Managements Discussion and Analysis, or MDA,
subsequent to adoption of SFAS123R. The Company will
adopt SAB107 in connection with its adoption of
SFAS123R, which could have a material impact on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash
flows. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS154, Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections. This new standard replaces
APB Opinion20, Accounting Changes and
SFAS3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim
Financial Statements. Among other changes, SFAS154
requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be
applied retrospectively with all prior period financial
statements presented on the new accounting principle, unless it
is impracticable to do so. SFAS154 also provides that a
change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long-lived
non-financial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate
prospectivelythat was effected by a change in accounting
principle, and that corrections of previously issued financial
statements should be termed a restatement. The new
standard is effective for accounting changes and corrections of
errors made in fiscal years beginning after December15,
2005. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have a
material impact on the Companys financial position or
results of operations. In October 2005, FASB issued FASB Staff Position
FSPNo.FAS123R-2, Practical
Accommodation to the Application of Grant Date as Defined in
FASB Statement No123R. Assuming all other
criteria of the grant date definition have been met, grant date
is the date the award is approved in accordance with an
entitys corporate governance provisions, provided the
award is a unilateral grant, whereby the recipient cannot
negotiate the key terms and award conditions. As well the key
terms and conditions are expected to be communicated to the
recipient within a relatively short time from the date of
approval. This FSP guidance is effective upon adoption of FASB
123R. The Company will evaluate this guidance, but does not
expect a material impact on its results of operations or
financial position. In November 2005, FASB issued FSP
No.FAS123R-3,
Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax
Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards. This FSP provides a
practical transition election related to accounting for the tax
effects of share-based payment awards to employees, as an
alternative to the transition guidance for the APIC pool in
paragraph81 of Statement123R. The guidance in this
FSP is effective after November10, 2005 as posted to the
FASB website. The Company may take up to one year from the later
of adoption of SFAS123R or the effective date of this
FSP to evaluate its available transition 58 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued alternatives and make its one-time election. The Company will
evaluate this guidance, but does not expect a material impact on
its results of operations or financial position. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP Nos. FAS115-1 and
FAS124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.
This FSP addresses the determination as to when an investment is
considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than
temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. This FSP
also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the
recognition of other-than-temporary impairments. The adoption of
this FSP is not expected to have a material effect on the
Companys consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. The guidance in this FSP will be
applied to reporting periods beginning after December15,
2005. In February 2006, FASB issued FSP No.FAS123R-4,
Classification of Options and Similar Instruments Issued
as Employee Compensation That Allow for Cash Settlement upon the
Occurrence of a Contingent Event. The guidance in this FSP
amends certain paragraphs in FASB 123R and addresses
situations when a company has option plans that require the
company to settle outstanding options in cash upon the
occurrence of certain contingent events. This FSP concludes that
in such situations a probability notion should be applied. The
guidance in this FSP is effective upon adoption of FASB 123R.
The Company will evaluate this guidance, but does not expect a
material impact on its results of operations or financial
position.   
2.
ACQUISITION OF MENTAT, INC. On December21, 2004, Packeteer acquired all of the
outstanding common stock of Mentat, a privately held company
located in Los Angeles, California. Mentat products are designed
to provide high performance networking solutions for satellite
and high-latency networks. The acquisition deepens and extends
Packeteers intellectual property and provides advanced
acceleration capabilities for new WAN performance solutions for
global customers. The aggregate purchase price of Mentat was approximately
$191million, including acquisition costs. Of the
$191million, $173million was paid in cash upon
closing and the remaining $18million was paid to the
former shareholders of Mentat upon the collection of a non-trade
receivable. The non-trade receivable was collected in January
2005 and was immediately paid to the former shareholders of
Mentat per the terms of the purchase agreement. Our methodology
for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase
acquisitions is determined through established valuation
techniques in the high-technology networking industry. Goodwill
is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the
sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable
intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed. The
following table presents the allocation of 59 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

related acquisition costs, to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed, based on their fair values in thousands

Of the $72million acquired intangibles, $51million
was assigned to developed technology, $19million to
customer contracts and relationships and $200,000 to tradename.
These intangible assets have useful lives ranging from one to
six years. Both the purchased intangible assets and the goodwill
are expected to be deductible for tax purposes. In March 2005, an OEM customer of Mentat exercised its option to
buyout its license agreement. In accordance with the terms of
the license, for a total of $30million, the customer was
granted a perpetual, non-transferable and non-exclusive binary
and source code license to certain Mentat software plus support
and maintenance for a period of twelve months. The
$30million fee was recorded as deferred revenue and is
being recognized as revenue over a twelve-month period. For the
year ended December31, 2005, Packeteer included
$23million in revenues under this arrangement, with the
balance of $669,000 remaining in deferred revenue. A portion of
the purchased intangible asset Customer Contracts and
Relationships was related to this particular customer
contract. The estimated useful life on this portion of the
intangible asset was reduced from six years to one year. In addition, under the terms of the agreement, Packeteer was to
pay up to $37million in retention bonuses to former
Mentat employees including both cash and restricted stock to
incent Mentat employees to remain with Packeteer. The cash
bonuses, totaling approximately $20million were to be
paid to the Mentat employees in equal installments, one half one
year from the date of acquisition and the remainder on the two
year anniversary of the acquisition, so long as the employee
remains employed with Packeteer on each of the installment
dates. During 2005, $870,000 was paid to former Mentat employees
under the cash retention bonus plan. Approximately $690,000
remains to be paid in December 2006. The restricted stock
retention bonuses totaling approximately 114,000 restricted
shares were valued at $17million, however, approximately
4,000shares valued at $59,000 were repurchased on the date
of acquisition due to employee terminations. The value of the
shares was determined based on the fair value of the
Companys stock at the date of issuance. The shares vest in
equal installments, one third one year from the date of
acquisition, one third on the second anniversary of the
acquisition and one third on the third anniversary of the
acquisition, so long as the employee remains employed with
Packeteer on each of the anniversary dates. Approximately 34,000
of these shares vested in December 2005. The remaining shares
will vest in December 2006 and 2007. The Company recognized
deferred stock-based compensation of approximately
$16million associated with these restricted shares. This

the fiscal 2005 financial statements presentation. Accordingly,
the statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended

The Company invests in investment grade securities. The
unrealized losses on these investments were caused by interest
rate increases and not credit quality. At this time, we believe
that, due to the nature of the investments, the financial
condition of the issuers, and Packeteers ability and
intent to hold the investments through these short-term loss
positions, factors would not indicate that these unrealized
losses should be viewed as other-than-temporary.

CONTINGENCIES In November 2001, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York against the Company, certain officers and directors of
the Company, and the underwriters of the Companys initial
public offering. An amended complaint, captioned In re
Packeteer, Inc. Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation,
01-CV-10185 SAS,
was filed on April20, 2002. The amended complaint alleges violations of the federal
securities laws on behalf of a purported class of those who
acquired the Companys common stock between the date of the
Companys initial public offering, or IPO, and
December6, 2000. The amended complaint alleges that the
description in the prospectus for the Companys IPO was
materially false and misleading in describing the compensation
to be earned by the underwriters of the Companys IPO, and
in not describing certain alleged arrangements among
underwriters and initial purchasers of the Companys common
stock. The amended complaint seeks damages and certification of
a plaintiff class consisting of all persons who acquired shares
of the Companys common stock between July27, 1999
and December6, 2000. A special committee of the board of directors has authorized the
Company to negotiate a settlement of the pending claims
substantially consistent with a memorandum of understanding
negotiated among class plaintiffs, all issuer defendants and
their insurers. The parties have negotiated a settlement, which
is subject to approval by the Court. On February15, 2005,
the Court issued an Opinion and Order preliminarily approving
the settlement, provided that the defendants and plaintiffs
agree to a modification narrowing the scope of the bar order set
forth in the original settlement agreement. The parties agreed
to a modification narrowing the scope of the bar order, and on
August31, 2005, the Court issued an order preliminarily
approving the settlement. We do not currently believe that the
outcome of this proceeding will have a material adverse impact
on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
No amount has been accrued as of December31, 2005, as we
believe a loss is neither probable nor estimable. The Company is routinely involved in legal and administrative
proceedings incidental to its normal business activities and
believes that these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. 63 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Net current deferred tax assets of $718,000 and $540,000 are

deferred tax assets of $46million and $18million
are included in other non-current assets at December31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. A valuation allowance has been
provided to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount
management believes is more likely than not to be realized.
Expected realization of deferred tax assets for which a
valuation allowance has not been recognized is based upon the
reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and taxable
income expected to be generated in the future. The net change in
the total valuation allowance for the year ended
December31, 2005 was a decrease of $25million,
which is comprised of a release of valuation allowance of
$32million, partially offset by an increase in valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets attributable to employee stock
option deductions. The net change in the total valuation
allowance for the year ended December31, 2004 was a
decrease of $58million, of which $24million
related to release of valuation allowance and $37million
related to operating losses utilized. The net change in the
valuation allowance for the year ended December31, 2003
was a decrease of $441,000. Approximately $163million of the valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets is attributable to employee stock option
deductions, the benefit from which will be allocated to
additional paid-in capital when, and if, it is subsequently
realized. Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because it is
managements intention to indefinitely reinvest such
undistributed earnings outside the U.S. At December31, 2005, the Company has net operating loss
carryforwards for federal and California income tax purposes of
approximately $294million and $92million,
respectively. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss
carryforwards will begin to expire in 2019, and the California
net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2012.
At December31, 2005, the Company had federal and
California and Canadian research credit carryforwards of
approximately $30million, $30million and
$10million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal
research credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2011. The
California research credit carryforwards can be carried forward
indefinitely. The Canadian research credits will begin to expire
in 2014. Income taxes paid were $811,000, $475,000 and $648,000 for 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively. 65 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY   
PREFERRED AND COMMON STOCK The Companys Board of Directors has authorized
5,000,000shares of preferred stock. The authorized
preferred stock shares are undesignated and the Board has the
authority to issue and to determine the rights, preference and
privileges thereof. The Companys Board of Directors has authorized
85,000,000shares of common stock.   
WARRANTS As of December31, 2005, 45,000 warrants to purchase
common stock were outstanding and exercisable with a $625
exercise price per share and an expiration date in May 2009.   
1999 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN In May 1999, the Companys Board of Directors adopted the
1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP. The ESPP became
effective July27, 1999. At that time, 500,000shares
were reserved for issuance under this plan. The number of shares
reserved under this ESPP automatically increases annually
beginning on January1, 2000 by the lesser of one million
shares or 2% of the total number of shares of common stock
outstanding. The ESPP permits participants to purchase common
stock through payroll deductions of up to 15% of an
employees compensation, including commissions, overtime,
bonuses and other incentive compensation. The purchase price per
share is equal to 85% of the fair market value per share on the
participants entry date into the offering period or, if
lower, 85% of the fair market value per share on the semi-annual
purchase date. As of December31, 2005, 13million
shares had been issued under the plan and 29million were
available for future issuance. The fair value of the discount
and look-back features are considered compensation for purposes
of computing the Companys proforma earnings for stock
based compensation.   
1999 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN The 1999 Stock Incentive Plan 1999 Plan is intended to serve
as the successor program to our 1996 Equity Incentive Plan 1996
Plan. In May 1999, the Companys Board of Directors
approved the 1999 Plan, which became effective on July27,
1999, under which 900,000shares were reserved for
issuance. Previously, 515,000shares were authorized under
the 1996 Plan. In addition, any shares not issued under the 1996
Plan will also be available for grant under the 1999 Plan. The
number of shares reserved under the 1999 Plan automatically
increases annually beginning on January1, 2000 by the
lesser of three million shares or 5% of the total number of
shares of common stock outstanding. Under the 1999 Plan,
eligible individuals may be granted options to purchase common
shares or may be issued shares of common stock directly. The
1999 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors, which sets the terms and conditions of the
options. Non-statutory stock options and incentive stock options
are exercisable at prices not less than 85% and 100 respectively, of the fair value on the date of grant. The
options become 25% vested one year after the date of grant with
1/48per month vesting thereafter and expire at the end of
10years from date of grant or sooner if terminated by the
Board of Directors. As of December31, 2005, options for
204million shares had been issued and 27million
were available for future grant. 66 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION In connection with the acquisition of Mentat in December 2004,
the Company issued approximately 114,000 restricted shares
valued at $17million, however, approximately
4,000shares valued at $59,000 were repurchased on the date
of acquisition due to employee terminations. The value of the
shares was determined based on the fair value of the
Companys stock at the date of issuance. The shares vest in
equal installments, one-third one year from the date of
acquisition, one-third on the second anniversary of the
acquisition and one-third on the third anniversary of the
acquisition, so long as the employee is still employed by
Packeteer on the anniversary date. The Company recorded deferred
stock-based compensation of approximately $16million
associated with these restricted shares. This amount is included
as a component of stockholders equity and is being
amortized by charges to operations over the vesting period of
the restricted shares in accordance with the method described in
FIN28. Amortization of stock-based compensation associated
with these shares totaled $901,000 and $14,000 for the years
ended December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During
2005, approximately 10,000 of these restricted shares were
repurchased by the Company due to terminations, according to the
terms of the shareholder agreements. In December 2005,
approximately 34,000shares vested. At December31,
2005, there were 66,000 restricted shares remaining. In 2000, the Company recorded deferred stock-based compensation
of $11million related to employee options assumed in the
Workfire acquisition. The amounts were being amortized over the
vesting period for the individual options, generally four years.
Amortization of stock-based compensation of $19,000 related to
these options was recognized during the year ended
December31, 2003.   
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS Comprehensive income loss consists entirely of unrealized
losses on marketable securities of $207,000 and $182,000 for the
years ended December31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Tax
effects of the components of other comprehensive income or loss
are not considered material for any periods presented.

401k PLAN In 1997, the Company adopted a 401k plan 401k.
Participation in the 401k is available to all employees. Entry
date to the 401k is the first day of each month. Each
participant may elect to contribute an amount up to 100% of his
or her annual base salary plus commission and bonus, but not to
exceed the statutory limit as prescribed by the Internal Revenue
Code. The Company may make discretionary contributions to the
401k. To date, no contributions have been made by the Company.

SEGMENT REPORTING The Companys chief operating decision maker is considered
to be the Companys CEO. The CEO reviews financial
information presented on a consolidated basis substantially
similar to the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, the
Company has concluded that it operates in one segment and
accordingly has provided only the required enterprise-wide
disclosures. 68 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
a
Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of the our
management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined
under
Rule13a-15e
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2005,
were ineffective to ensure that the information required to be
disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commissions rules and forms.   
b
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rules13a-15f
and 15d-15f under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness within the meaning of PCAOB Auditing
Standard No2 is a control deficiency, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, and this
assessment identified a material weakness in our internal
control over financial reporting related to our income tax
provision. Specifically, we did not maintain effective controls
over: ithe reconciliation of the income tax accounts to
the supporting schedules, and iithe review of the income
tax account reconciliation by someone other than the preparer.
These deficiencies resulted in a material misstatement of our
income tax provision that was adjusted prior to the issuance of
our 2005 consolidated financial statements. In making its assessment of internal control over financial
reporting, management used the criteria issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO,
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Because of
the material weakness described above, managements
conclusion is that we did not maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an
attestation report on managements assessment of our
internal control over financial reporting. That report is
included herein under ITEM8.   
c
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended December31, 2005 that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 70 Table of Contents Management plans to remediate the above deficiencies during the
three months ending March31, 2006 by ensuring a
reconciliation of our income tax accounts is properly prepared
and then reviewed by an individual other than the preparer,
which will include the use of third party tax experts.
