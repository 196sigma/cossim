Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note A. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
1. Nature of Operations
Boston Edison Company Boston Edison received final approval of its 
reorganization plan to form a holding company structure from the Securities
and Exchange Commission SEC in May 1998. Effective May 20, 1998 the holding
company, BEC Energy BEC, was formed with Boston Edison as a wholly owned 
subsidiary of BEC.
Within its newly restructured industry, BEC has announced its intention to 
focus its utility operations on the transmission and distribution of energy.
The sale of Boston Edison fossil generating assets to Sithe Energies, Inc.
Sithe was completed in May 1998. In November 1998, Boston Edison signed an
agreement with Entergy Nuclear Generating Company Entergy to sell its wholly
owned nuclear generating unit, Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station Pilgrim. BEC
signed a merger agreement with Commonwealth Energy System CES in December 
1998 that will create an energy delivery company serving approximately 13 
million customers located entirely within Massachusetts, including more than
one million electric customers in 81 communities and 240,000 gas customers in
51 communities.
Boston Edison currently supplies electricity at retail to an area of 590 
square miles, including the city of Boston and 39 surrounding cities and 
towns. It also supplies electricity at wholesale for resale to other 
utilities and municipalities. Electric operating revenues are approximately
90% retail and 10% wholesale. Unregulated activities continue to be conducted
through Boston Energy Technology Group BETG. Refer to Note J to these 
Consolidated Financial Statements for information on BEC nonutility 
operations. 
2. Basis of Consolidation and Accounting
Under the new holding company structure the owners of Boston Edison common
stock became BEC common shareholders. Existing debt and preferred stock of 
Boston Edison remained obligations of the regulated utility business. 
Effective June 25, 1998, BETG ceased being a subsidiary of Boston Edison and
became a wholly owned subsidiary of BEC. The accompanying consolidated 
financial statements reflect the results of operations and cash flows of 
Boston Edison prior to the reorganization. The consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 1997 reflects the financial position of Boston Edison which also
included BETG. The consolidated financial statements also include the 
activities of Boston Edison wholly owned subsidiary, Harbor Electric Energy
Company HEEC. All significant intercompany transactions have been 
eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year data
to conform with the current presentation.
Boston Edison follows accounting policies prescribed by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission FERC and the Massachusetts Department of 
Telecommunications and Energy DTE. In addition, BEC and its subsidiaries
are subject to the accounting and reporting requirements of the SEC. The 
consolidated financial statements conform with generally accepted accounting
principles GAAP. As a rate-regulated company Boston Edison has been subject
to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the 
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation SFAS 71, under GAAP. The application
of SFAS 71 results in differences in the timing of recognition of certain 
expenses from that of other businesses and industries. As a result of the 
32
Massachusetts electric industry restructuring legislation enacted in November
1997 and the DTE order regarding the related Boston Edison settlement 
agreement, as of December 31, 1997, the provisions of SFAS 71 are no longer 
being applied to the generation business. The distribution business remains 
subject to rate-regulation and continues to meet the criteria for application
of SFAS 71. Refer to Note B to these Consolidated Financial Statements for 
more information on the accounting implications of the electric utility 
industry restructuring.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires BEC
and its subsidiaries to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent 
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from these estimates.
3. Revenues
Estimates of retail base transmission and distribution revenues for 
electricity used by customers but not yet billed are recorded at the end of 
each accounting period.
4. Utility Plant
Utility plant is stated at original cost of construction. The costs of 
replacements of property units are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs and
replacements of minor items are expensed as incurred. The original cost of 
property retired, net of salvage value, and the related costs of removal are
charged to accumulated depreciation.
5. Depreciation and Nuclear Fuel Amortization
Depreciation of utility plant is computed on a straight-line basis using 
composite rates based on the estimated useful lives of the various classes of
property. Excluding the effect of the adjustment discussed below, the overall
composite depreciation rates were 328%, 330% and 333% in 1998, 1997 and 
1996, respectively.
Upon the completion of a review of Boston Edison electric generating units,
management determined that the oldest and least efficient fossil units Mystic
4, 5 and 6 were unlikely to provide competitively-priced power beyond the 
year 2000. Therefore the estimated remaining economic lives of these units 
was revised to five years in 1996. These units were sold in May 1998. Refer
to Note B to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
The cost of decommissioning Pilgrim Station is excluded from depreciation 
rates. Refer to Note D to these Consolidated Financial Statements for a 
discussion of nuclear decommissioning. The cost of nuclear fuel is amortized
based on the amount of energy Pilgrim Station generates. Nuclear fuel expense
also includes an amount for the estimated costs of ultimately disposing of 
spent nuclear fuel and for assessments for the decontamination and 
decommissioning of United States Department of Energy nuclear enrichment 
facilities.
6. Deferred Nuclear Outage Costs
The incremental costs associated with nuclear refueling and maintenance 
outages are deferred when incurred and amortized over Pilgrim Station two-
year operating cycle.
33
7. Costs Associated with Issuance and Redemption of Debt and Preferred Stock
Consistent with the recovery in electric rates, discounts, redemption premiums
and related costs associated with the issuance and redemption of long-term 
debt and preferred stock are deferred. The costs related to long-term debt 
are recognized as an addition to interest expense over the life of the 
original or replacement debt. Beginning in 1996, consistent with an 
accounting order received from the FERC, costs related to preferred stock 
issuances and redemptions are reflected as a direct reduction to retained 
earnings upon redemption or over the average life of the replacement preferred
stock series as applicable.
8. Allowance for Borrowed Funds Used During Construction AFUDC
AFUDC represents the estimated costs to finance utility plant construction.
In accordance with regulatory accounting, AFUDC is included as a cost of 
utility plant and a reduction of current interest charges. Although AFUDC is
not a current source of cash income, the costs are recovered from customers 
over the service life of the related plant in the form of increased revenues
collected as a result of higher depreciation expense. AFUDC rates in 1998, 
1997 and 1996 were 588%, 604% and 587%, respectively, and represented only
the cost of short-term debt.
9. Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid securities with 
maturities of 90 days or less when purchased. BEC banking arrangement does
not require it to fund checks until they are presented for payment. 
Therefore, outstanding checks are included in cash and accounts payable until
presented for payment.
10. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable are substantially recoverable. This recovery occurs both
from customer payments and from the portion of customer charges that provides
for the recovery of bad debt expense. Accordingly, a significant allowance 
for doubtful accounts balance has not been maintained.
11. Regulatory Assets
Regulatory assets represent costs incurred which are expected to be collected
from customers through future charges in accordance with agreements with 
regulators. These costs are expensed when the corresponding revenues are 
received in order to appropriately match revenues and expenses. The majority
of these costs is currently being recovered from customers over varying time
periods. Refer to Note B to these Consolidated Financial Statements for 
information regarding the recovery of regulatory assets related to the 
generation business.

12. Earnings Per Common Share
Basic earnings per common share EPS is calculated by dividing net income,
after deductions for preferred dividends, by the weighted average common 
shares outstanding during the year. Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share, requires the disclosure of diluted EPS.
Diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the 
weighted average common shares is increased to include the number of dilutive
potential common shares. Diluted EPS reflects the impact on shares 
outstanding of the deferred nonvested shares and stock options granted under
the Stock Incentive Plan.
The following table summarizes the reconciling amounts between basic and 
diluted EPS in thousands, except per share amounts       1998   1997   1996

13. RCN Joint Venture
BETG is a participant in a telecommunications venture with RCN Telecom 
Services, Inc. RCN. As part of the joint venture agreement, BETG has the 
option to exchange certain portions of its joint venture interest for shares
of RCN Corporation common stock. During 1998, BETG exercised its option to 
convert a portion of its interest with a cost of $11 million. BETG expects to
receive approximately 11 million RCN Corporation common shares during the 
first quarter of 1999.

Note B. Electric Utility Industry Restructuring
1. Accounting Implications
Under the traditional revenue requirements model, electric rates have been 
based on the cost of providing electric service. Under this model, Boston 
Edison has been subject to certain accounting standards that are not 
applicable to other businesses and industries in general. The application of
SFAS 71 requires companies to defer the recognition of certain costs when 
incurred if future rate recovery of these costs is expected. As a result of
the Massachusetts electric industry restructuring legislation enacted in 
November 1997 and the DTE order regarding Boston Edison related settlement
agreement, as of December 31, 1997, the provisions of SFAS 71 are no longer 
being applied to the generation business. Under the settlement agreement, 
approximately 75% of the net assets of Pilgrim Station are recoverable through
the non-bypassable transition charge of the utility distribution business.
The distribution business continues to be subject to rate-regulation. The 
remaining 25% is collected under Pilgrim wholesale power contracts. The 
1998 consolidated balance sheet reflects a reclassification of the Pilgrim net
assets recoverable through the transition charge from utility plant to 
regulatory asset. This Pilgrim regulatory asset, included in the generation-
related regulatory asset on the consolidated balance sheet continues to be 
grouped with utility plant for financial statement presentation.
Completion of the sale of Boston Edison fossil generating assets took place
in May 1998. Boston Edison received proceeds from the sale of $655 million,
including $121 million for a six-month transitional power purchase contract.
The amount received above net book value on the sale of these assets is being
returned to Boston Edison customers over the settlement period. That amount
is partially offset by certain costs recoverable through the transition charge
due to the support of standard offer service provided by Boston Edison 
fossil generating assets prior to the divestiture. The net deferred gain is 
included as a reduction to the generation-related regulatory asset on the 1998
consolidated balance sheet. In addition, Boston Edison received $19 million
from Sithe for inventory and other closing adjustments.
The implementation of the Boston Edison settlement agreement had certain 
accounting implications. The highlights of these include Generation-related plant and other regulatory assets
Plant and other regulatory assets related to the generation business, except
for those related to Pilgrim wholesale contracts, are recovered through the
transition charge. This recovery, which includes a return, will occur over a
twelve-year period that began on March 1, 1998 the retail access date.
Depreciation
The composite depreciation rate for distribution utility plant increased from
238% to 298% as of the retail access date.
Fuel and purchased power charge
The fuel and purchased power charge ceased as of the retail access date. The
net remaining overcollection of fuel and purchased power costs will be 
reflected in future customer billings. These over recovered costs are 
included as an offset to the settlement recovery mechanisms on the 1998 
consolidated balance sheet.
36
Standard offer charge
Customers have the option of continuing to buy power from the electric 
delivery business at standard offer prices as of the retail access date. The
standard offer charge began at 28 cents/kWh at the retail access date, 
increased to 32 cents/kWh on June 1, 1998, to 369 cents/kWh on January 1, 
1999 and is scheduled to increase to 51 cents/kWh by 2004. The cost of 
providing standard offer service, which includes fuel and purchased power 
costs, is recovered from standard offer customers on a fully reconciling 
basis.
Distribution and transmission charges
Distribution rates are subject to a minimum and maximum return on average 
common equity ROE through December 31, 2000. The ROE is subject to a floor
of 6% and a ceiling of 1175%. If the ROE is below 6%, Boston Edison is 
authorized to add a surcharge to distribution rates in order to achieve the 6%
floor. If the ROE is above 11%, it is required to adjust distribution rates
by an amount necessary to reduce the calculated ROE between 11% and 125% by
50%, and a return above 125% by 100%. No adjustment is made if the ROE is
between 6% and 11%. In addition, distribution rates will be adjusted for any
changes in tax laws or accounting principles that result in a change in costs
of more than $1 million. The cost of providing transmission service to 
distribution customers is recovered on a fully reconciling basis.
Nuclear generation
Under the settlement agreement, the annual performance adjustment charge 
ceased and the cost recovery mechanism for Pilgrim Station changed effective
March 1, 1998. Approximately 25% of the operations and capital costs, 
including a return on investment, continues to be collected under Pilgrim 
wholesale contracts. Through Pilgrim sale closing date, 25% of any profit
or loss from the sale of Pilgrim output will be shared with distribution 
customers through the transition charge. In addition, Boston Edison will 
obtain transition payments up to a maximum of $23 million per year depending
on the level of costs incurred for such items as property taxes, insurance,
regulatory fees and security requirements.
2. Generating Assets Divestiture
The Boston Edison restructuring settlement agreement included a provision for
the divestiture of its fossil generating assets no later than six months after
the retail access date. In December 1997, Boston Edison entered into a 
purchase and sale agreement with Sithe Energies, a privately-held company 
headquartered in New York, to purchase these non-nuclear generating assets.
The sale of these assets was finalized on May 15, 1998.
In April 1998, Boston Edison began soliciting expressions of interest for the
sale of its nuclear generating unit, Pilgrim Station as part of the previously
announced strategy to exit the generation business. On November 19, 1998, 
Boston Edison announced the selection of Entergy, a subsidiary of New Orleans-
based Entergy Corporation, as the winning bidder for the purchase of Pilgrim.
Entergy is expected to purchase Pilgrim in a deal valued at an estimated $121
million. In addition, under the agreement Boston Edison will fully fund and
transfer its decommissioning trust fund to Entergy and Entergy will then 
assume full liability and responsibility for decommissioning the Pilgrim site.
A purchase and sale agreement has been signed and all required approvals are
anticipated in the second quarter of 1999. The purchase price includes 
reimbursement for certain costs to be expended by Boston Edison in 1999.
37
Therefore, the actual proceeds could be impacted by the ultimate timing of the
transaction.
As part of a benefits package offered to employees affected by the nuclear 
divestiture, eligible non-represented nuclear and designated nuclear support
employees were offered unreduced retirement and transition benefits under a 
voluntary early retirement program VERP. Sixteen employees elected to 
participate in the VERP. A retention benefit program was offered to all non-
represented nuclear and designated nuclear support employees that did not 
elect or were ineligible to retire under the VERP who continue to work through
the sale closing date. It is anticipated that approximately 300 non-
represented nuclear and designated nuclear employees will receive one-time 
retention payments under this program. Costs associated with the VERP and 
retention program are recoverable under Boston Edison settlement agreement.
3. Nuclear Asset Impairment
As part of the settlement agreement, the net investment in Pilgrim Station as
of December 31, 1995 adjusted for depreciation through 1997 is recovered 
through the distribution transition charge. Due to the market pressures in 
the industry, the ultimate recovery of investments made in Pilgrim since 1995
is not certain. Therefore, in 1997 the investment in Pilgrim was reduced by
the $13 million invested in the plant since January 1, 1996 as an impairment
loss under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for
the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of. An after tax charge of approximately $8 million due to this reduction was
recorded to non-operating expense on the consolidated statement of income in
the fourth quarter of 1997.
Note C. Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109. SFAS 
109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the 
future tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and
the tax basis of assets and liabilities. In accordance with SFAS 109 net 
regulatory assets of $522 million and $511 million and corresponding net 
increases in accumulated deferred income taxes were recorded as of 
December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The regulatory assets represent the
additional future revenues to be collected from customers for deferred income
taxes.
Accumulated deferred income taxes consisted of the following                                  December 31,

The 1998 effective tax rate declined by 51% as a result of the recognition in
net income of the remaining unamortized investment tax credits related to 
Boston Edison fossil generating assets at the time of their sale. This 
shareholder benefit is included in other expense, net on the 1998 consolidated
statement of income.
The 1997 effective tax rate declined by 08% as a result of the favorable 
outcome of an Internal Revenue Service appeal related to investment tax 
credits.
Note D. Nuclear Decommissioning and Nuclear Waste Disposal
1. Nuclear Decommissioning
As a nuclear generating facility, Pilgrim Station will be required to be 
decommissioned upon the expiration of its operating license. Decommissioning
means to remove nuclear facilities from service safely and reduce residual 
radioactivity to a level that permits termination of the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission NRC license and release of the property for unrestricted use. 
Estimated decommissioning costs are recorded to depreciation expense on the 
consolidated statements of income over Pilgrim expected service life. These
costs are recovered through charges to retail and wholesale contract 
customers. In November 1998, Boston Edison filed an update of Pilgrim 
Station decommissioning cost study with the DTE. The updated study includes
an estimate of decommissioning and fuel storage costs of approximately $600
million in 1997 dollars.
2. Spent Nuclear Fuel
The spent fuel storage facility at Pilgrim Station is expected to provide 
storage capacity through approximately 2003. Boston Edison has a license 
amendment from the NRC to modify the facility to provide sufficient room for
spent nuclear fuel generated through the end of Pilgrim operating license in
2012; however, any further modifications are subject to review by the DTE.
39
Delays in identifying a permanent storage site have continually postponed
plans for the United States Department of Energy DOE long-term storage and
disposal for spent nuclear fuel. The DOE current estimate for an available
site is no earlier than 2010. In November 1997, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the lack of an interim storage 
facility does not excuse the DOE from meeting its contract obligation to begin
accepting spent nuclear fuel no later than January 31, 1998. This decision 
was in response to petitions filed by Boston Edison and other interested 
parties seeking declaratory rulings concerning enforcement and remedies for 
the DOE failure to accept spent fuel in a timely manner. The court directed
the plaintiffs to pursue relief under terms of their contracts with the DOE.
Based on this ruling, the DOE may have to pay contract damages for not taking
the spent nuclear fuel as scheduled. Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 
1982, it is the ultimate responsibility of the DOE to permanently dispose of
spent nuclear fuel. Boston Edison currently pays a fee of $100 per net 
megawatthour sold from Pilgrim Station generation under a nuclear fuel 
disposal contract with the DOE.
The DOE denied Boston Edison petition to suspend payments to the Nuclear 
Waste Fund based on its interpretation of the U.S. Court of Appeal decision
made in November 1997. The DOE has, however, made an offer to consider 
amendments to existing contracts to address the hardships the anticipated 
delay in accepting spent fuel may cause individual contract holders.
3. Nuclear Divestiture
As discussed in Note B to these Consolidated Financial Statements, in November
1998 Boston Edison announced the selection of Entergy as the winning bidder
for the purchase of Pilgrim. A purchase and sale agreement has been signed
and all required approvals are anticipated in the second quarter of 1999.
Under the agreement Boston Edison will fully fund and transfer its 
decommissioning trust fund to Entergy and Entergy will then assume full 
liability and responsibility for decommissioning and waste disposal at Pilgrim
Station.
Note E. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits
The following information is presented in accordance with Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 132, Employers' Disclosures about Pensions
and Other Postretirement Benefits, effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1997.
1. Pensions
Boston Edison has a defined benefit funded retirement plan with certain 
contributory features that covers substantially all employees and an unfunded
supplemental retirement plan for certain management employees.

Net periodic benefit cost       $ 10,001  $ 17,472  $ 22,506
As a result of the fossil and nuclear divestitures discussed in Note B to 
these Consolidated Financial Statements, amounts recognized for curtailment,
settlement and special termination benefit costs were $2,705,000, $0 and 
$665,000, respectively for 1998 and $1,300,000, $3,162,000 and $3,530,000, 
respectively for 1997. These amounts are recoverable under Boston Edison
settlement agreement.
Boston Edison experienced a high number of employee retirements from 1994 to
1996. A large number of these retirements were as a direct result of the 1995
corporate restructuring. In 1997, a review of the accounting for the pension
expense related to the retirements revealed that an adjustment to the pension
costs related to these employees was necessary. Therefore, pension regulatory
asset was increased by $86 million in 1997 for the adjustment related to the
period covered by the 1992 Boston Edison settlement agreement. Through 1995,
in accordance with the 1992 settlement agreement, the difference between the
net pension cost of the retirement plan and its annual funding amount was 
deferred. The remaining adjustment did not have a material impact on the 
consolidated results of operations or financial position.
Boston Edison also provides defined contribution 401k plans for 
substantially all employees. It matches a portion of employees' voluntary 
contributions to the plans. Matching contributions of $8 million were made in
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
2. Other Postretirement Benefits
In addition to pension benefits, Boston Edison also provides health care and
other benefits to retired employees who meet certain age and years of service
liability requirements. These benefits are not available to management
employees hired on or after January 1, 1995.

Note F. Stock-Based Compensation
In 1997, Boston Edison initiated a Stock Incentive Plan the Plan which was
adopted by the board of directors and approved by common stockholders. The
Plan permits a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including stock 
options and deferred nonvested stock to be granted to certain key employees.
The Plan limits the terms of awards to ten years. Subject to adjustment for
stock-splits and similar events, the aggregate number of shares of common 
stock that may be delivered under the Plan is 2,000,000, including shares 
issued in lieu of or upon reinvestment of dividends arising from awards. 
During 1998, 19,150 shares of deferred stock and 419,200 ten-year non-
qualified stock options were granted under the plan. During 1997, 73,820 
shares of deferred stock and 298,400 ten-year non-qualified stock options were
granted. The weighted average grant date fair value of the deferred stock 
issued during 1998 and 1997 is $3975 and $2726, respectively. The options
were granted at the full market price of the stock on the date of the grant.
Both awards vest ratably over a three-year period.
44
Compensation cost for stock-based awards is recognized under the provisions of
Accounting Principals Board Opinion 25, which requires compensation cost to be
measured by the quoted stock market price at the measurement date less the 
amount, if any, an employee is required to pay. The required fair value

not less than 35% at all times and to maintain a ratio of consolidated 
earnings before interest and taxes to consolidated total interest expense of
not less than 2 to 1 for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters.

Boston Edison currently has regulatory authority to issue up to $350 million
of short-term debt. Boston Edison has a $200 million revolving credit 
agreement with a group of banks. This agreement is intended to provide a 
standby source of short-term borrowings. Under the terms of this agreement 
Boston Edison is required to maintain a common equity ratio of not less than
30% at all times. Commitment fees must be paid on the unused portion of the
total agreement amount. It also has arrangements with several banks to 
provide additional short-term credit on an uncommitted and as available basis.

The total of future minimum rental income to be received under noncancellable
subleases related to the above leases is $146,125.
BEC and its subsidiaries will capitalize a portion of lease rentals as part of
plant expenditures in the future. The total expense for both lease rentals 
and transmission agreements was $296 million in 1998, $275 million in 1997
and $263 million in 1996, net of capitalized expenses of $16 million in 
1998, $12 million in 1997 and $29 million in 1996.
Boston Edison had previously entered into various take or pay and throughput
agreements, primarily to supply the New Boston fossil generating station with
natural gas. As part of the fossil divestiture agreement, Sithe Energies 
assumed these obligations. The total expense under these agreements was $471
million in 1997 and $495 million in 1996.
2. Electric Company Investments
Boston Edison has an approximately 11% equity investment in two companies 
which own and operate transmission facilities to import electricity from the
Hydro-Quebec system in Canada. As an equity participant Boston Edison is 
required to guarantee, in addition to its own share, the total obligations of
those participants who do not meet certain credit criteria. At December 31,
1998, Boston Edison portion of these guarantees was $152 million.
Boston Edison has a 95% equity investment of approximately $2 million in 
Yankee Atomic Electric Company Yankee Atomic. In 1992 the board of 
directors of Yankee Atomic decided to discontinue operations of the Yankee 
Atomic nuclear generating station permanently and decommission the facility.
Yankee Atomic received approval from the FERC to continue to collect its 
investment and decommissioning costs through 2000, the period of the plant
operating license. The estimate of Boston Edison share of Yankee Atomic
investment and costs of decommissioning is approximately $8 million as of 
December 31, 1998. This estimate is recorded on the consolidated balance 
sheet as a power contract liability and an offsetting regulatory asset.
Boston Edison also has a 95% equity investment in Connecticut Yankee Atomic
Power Company CYAPC of approximately $10 million. In December 1996, the 
board of directors of CYAPC, which owns and operates the Connecticut Yankee 
nuclear electric generating unit Connecticut Yankee, unanimously voted to 
retire the unit. The decision was based on an economic analysis of the costs
of operating the unit through 2007, the period of its operating license, 
51
compared to the costs of closing the unit and incurring replacement power
costs for the same period.
Boston Edison share of Connecticut Yankee remaining investment and 
estimated costs of decommissioning is approximately $51 million as of 
December 31, 1998. This estimate is recorded on the consolidated balance 
sheet as a power contract liability and an offsetting regulatory asset similar
to Yankee Atomic.
In December 1996, CYAPC filed for rate relief at the FERC seeking to recover
certain post-operating costs, including decommissioning. In August 1998, the
FERC Administrative Law Judge ALJ released an initial decision regarding 
CYAPC filing. This decision called for the disallowance of the common 
equity return on the CYAPC investment subsequent to the shutdown. The 
decision also stated that decommissioning collections should continue to be
based on a previously approved estimate, with an adjustment for inflation, 
until a more reliable estimate is developed. In October 1998, both CYAPC and
Northeast Utilities, a 49% equity investor in CYAPC, filed briefs on 
exceptions to the ALJ decision. If the initial decision is upheld, CYAPC 
could be required to write off a portion of its investment in the generating
unit and refund a portion of the previously collected return on investment.
Management is currently unable to determine the ultimate outcome of this 
proceeding, however, the estimate of the effect of the ALJ initial decision
does not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or
results of operations.
3. Nuclear Insurance
The federal Price-Anderson Act currently provides $98 billion of financial
protection for public liability claims and legal costs arising from a single
nuclear-related accident. The first $200 million of nuclear liability is 
covered by commercial insurance. Additional nuclear liability insurance up to
$96 billion is provided by a retrospective assessment of up to $881 million
per incident levied on each of the 109 nuclear generating units currently 
licensed to operate in the United States, with a maximum assessment of $10
million per reactor per accident in any year.
Boston Edison has purchased insurance from Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited
NEIL to cover some of the costs to purchase replacement power during a 
prolonged accidental outage and the cost of repair, replacement, 
decontamination or decommissioning of utility property resulting from covered
incidents at Pilgrim Station. Boston Edison maximum potential total 
assessment for losses which occur during current policy years is $81 million
under both the replacement power and excess property damage, decontamination
and decommissioning policies.
4. Hazardous Waste
Boston Edison is an owner or operator of approximately 20 properties where oil
or hazardous materials were spilled or released. As such, Boston Edison is 
required to clean up these remaining properties in accordance with a timetable
developed by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection. There
are uncertainties associated with these costs due to the complexities of 
cleanup technology, regulatory requirements and the particular characteristics
of the different sites. Boston Edison also faces possible liability as a 
potentially responsible party in the cleanup of five multi-party hazardous 
waste sites in Massachusetts and other states where it is alleged to have 
generated, transported or disposed of hazardous waste at the sites. Boston 
52
Edison is one of many potentially responsible parties and currently expects to
have only a small percentage of the total potential liability for these sites.
Through December 31, 1998, BEC had approximately $6 million accrued on its 
consolidated balance sheet related to these cleanup liabilities. Management
is unable to fully determine a range of reasonably possible cleanup costs in
excess of the accrued amount. Based on its assessments of the specific site
circumstances, it does not believe that it is probable that any such 
additional costs will have a material impact on its consolidated financial 
position. However, it is reasonably possible that additional provisions for
cleanup costs that may result from a change in estimates could have a material
impact on the results of a reporting period in the near term.
5. Generating Unit Performance Program
Boston Edison generating unit performance program ceased March 1, 1998. 
Under this program the recovery of incremental purchased power costs resulting
from generating unit outages occurring through the retail access date is 
subject to review by the DTE. Proceedings relative to generating unit 
performance remain pending before the DTE. These proceedings will include the
review of replacement power costs associated with the shutdown of the 
Connecticut Yankee nuclear electric generating unit which is discussed in 
item 2. Management is unable to fully determine a range of reasonably 
possible disallowance costs in excess of amounts accrued. Based on its 
assessment of the information currently available, it does not believe that it
is probable that any such additional costs will have a material impact on its
consolidated financial position. However, it is reasonably possible that 
additional disallowance costs that may result from a change in estimates could
have a material impact on the results of a reporting period in the near term.
6. Legal Proceedings
Industry and corporate restructuring legal proceedings
The DTE order approving the Boston Edison settlement agreement and the DTE
order approving the formation of BEC as a holding company were appealed by
certain parties to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court SJC. In 
December 1998, the SJC dismissed the appeal of the order approving the holding
company formation. One settlement agreement appeal remains pending, however
there has to date been no briefing, hearing or other action taken with respect
to this proceeding.
In addition, along with other Massachusetts investor-owned utilities, Boston
Edison has been named as a defendant in a class action suit seeking to declare
certain provisions of the Massachusetts electric industry restructuring 
legislation unconstitutional.
Management is currently unable to determine the outcome of these outstanding
proceedings or the impact the proceedings may have on its consolidated results
of operations.
A referendum seeking repeal of the Massachusetts electric industry 
restructuring legislation that was enacted in November 1997 was overwhelmingly
defeated by a better than 70% to 30% margin in a state-wide general election
held on November 3, 1998. This outcome allows the comprehensive framework 
established for the restructuring of the electric industry to continue as 
intended under the enacted legislation.
53
Regulatory proceedings
In October 1997, the DTE opened a proceeding to investigate Boston Edison
compliance with the 1993 order which permitted the formation of BETG and 
authorized Boston Edison to invest up to $45 million in unregulated 
activities. Hearings began in the fourth quarter of 1998 and are expected to
be completed in the first half of 1999.
Each of the Reading Municipal Light Department, the Littleton Electric Light
Department and the West Boylston Municipal Light Department have filed 
separate claims for arbitration in Massachusetts alleging that the proposed
transfer of Pilgrim Station constitutes a breach of their respective power 
sale agreements and seeking to terminate those agreements. The remaining 
municipal light departments have also indicated that they plan to file similar
claims for arbitration. Boston Edison has requested the FERC to exercise its
pre-emptive authority to consider the claims of the municipal light 
departments. In the event that either the FERC determines, or as a result of
the arbitrations, that the contracts should be terminated, Boston Edison would
continue to be obligated to purchase power from Entergy that it intended to 
resell to the municipal light departments. Boston Edison may not be able to
resell such power in the short-term power exchange at a price equal to or 
greater than the price it is required to pay to Entergy. However, Boston 
Edison has filed at the DTE for recovery of any such shortfall as part of its
Pilgrim divestiture filing through the transition charge.
Management is currently unable to determine the outcome of these proceedings
or the impact these proceedings may have on its consolidated financial
position or results of operations.
Other litigation
In October 1998, the town of Plymouth, Massachusetts, the site of Pilgrim
Station, filed suit against Boston Edison. The town claims that Boston Edison
has wrongfully failed to execute an agreement with the town for payments in 
addition to taxes due to the town under the Massachusetts electric industry 
restructuring legislation. Boston Edison has disputed the town claim and 
will vigorously defend itself. In addition to this pending litigation, Boston
Edison and the town of Plymouth are also parties in proceedings before the 
Appellate Tax Board and the DTE concerning substantially the same dispute.
Management is unable to determine the ultimate outcome of these proceedings or
the impact they may have on its consolidated financial position or results of
operations.
In the normal course of its business BEC and its subsidiaries are also 
involved in certain other legal matters. Management is unable to fully 
determine a range of reasonably possible legal costs in excess of amounts 
accrued. Based on the information currently available, it does not believe 
that it is probable that any such additional costs will have a material impact
on its consolidated financial position. However, it is reasonably possible
that additional legal costs that may result from a change in estimates could
have a material impact on the results of a reporting period in the near term.

Note L. Long-Term Power Contracts
1. Long-Term Contracts for the Purchase of Electricity
Boston Edison entered into a 13-month agreement effective December 1, 1998 to
transfer all of the unit output entitlements from its long-term power purchase
contracts to Select Energy Select, a subsidiary of Northeast Utilities, Inc.
In return, Select will provide full energy service requirements to Boston 
Edison, including NEPOOL capability responsibilities, at FERC approved tariff
rates through December 31, 1999.

a Boston Edison purchases 755% of the energy output of this unit under
two contracts. One contract represents 135MW and expires in the year
2015. The other contract is for 84MW and expires in 2010. Energy is
paid for based on a price per kWh actually received. Boston Edison does
not pay a proportionate share of the unit capital and fixed operating
costs.
b Boston Edison pays for this energy based on a price per kWh actually
received. An agreement has been made with L'Energia to terminate this
contract. FERC approval of this agreement is pending. 55
Boston Edison total fixed and variable costs associated with these contracts
in 1998, 1997 and 1996 were approximately $267 million, $288 million and $281
million, respectively. Boston Edison minimum fixed payments under these
contracts for the years after 1998 are as follows in thousands
