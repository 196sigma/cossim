40 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm The Board of Directors
and Shareholders of Rush Enterprises,Inc. We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rush Enterprises,Inc. and
subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2008 and 2007, and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2008. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. In our opinion, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Rush Enterprises,Inc.
and subsidiaries at December31, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. As discussed in Note 2 to
the financial statements, in 2006 the Company changed its method of accounting
for share based payments and in 2007 the Company changed its method for
accounting for income taxes. We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States, Rush Enterprises,Inc.s internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2008, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March10,
2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS Rush Enterprises,Inc.
the Company was incorporated in 1965 under the laws of the State of
Texas. The Company now operates a Truck
segment and a Construction Equipment segment.
The Truck segment operates a regional network of Rush Truck
Centers. Rush Truck Centers sell trucks
manufactured by Peterbilt, Volvo, GMC, Hino, UD, Ford or Isuzu. Through its strategically located network of
Rush Truck Centers, the Company provides one-stop service for the needs of its
customers, including retail sales of new and used trucks, aftermarket parts
sales, service and repair facilities, financing, leasing and rental, and
Insurance products. The Companys truck
centers are located in areas on or near major highways in Alabama, Arizona,
California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma,
Tennessee and Texas. The Construction Equipment segment, formed in 1997,
operates John Deere equipment centers in Southeast Texas. Construction equipment dealership operations
include the retail sale of new and used construction equipment, aftermarket
parts and service facilities, equipment rentals and the financing of new and
used equipment. See Note 20 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for segment information. On September20, 2007, our shareholders
approved an amendment to our Restated Articles of Incorporation increasing the
total number of authorized shares of ClassA common stock from 40,000,000
to 60,000,000 and total number of authorized shares of ClassB common
stock from 10,000,000 to 20,000,000. On
the same date, our Board of Directors declared a 3-for-2 stock split of the ClassA
common stock and ClassB common stock, to be effected in the form of a
stock dividend. On October10,
2007, Rush Enterprises,Inc. distributed one additional share of stock for
every two shares of ClassA common stock and ClassB common stock
held by shareholders of record as of October1, 2007. All share and per share data except par
value in this Form10-K have been adjusted and restated to reflect the
stock dividend as if it occurred on the first day of the earliest period
presented. 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles
of Consolidation The
consolidated financial statements presented herein include the accounts of Rush
Enterprises,Inc. together with our consolidated subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Estimates
in Financial Statements The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results may differ from those estimates. Cash
and Cash Equivalents Cash
and cash equivalents generally consist of cash and other money market
instruments. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of ninety days or less to be cash equivalents. 46 Table of
Contents Allowance
for Doubtful Receivables and Repossession Losses The
Company provides an allowance for doubtful receivables and repossession losses
after considering historical loss experience and other factors that might
affect the collection of accounts receivable and the ability of customers to
meet their obligations on finance contracts sold by the Company. Inventories Inventories are
stated at the lower of cost or market value.
Cost is determined by specific identification of new and used truck and
construction equipment inventory and by the first-in, first-out method for
tires, parts and accessories. An
allowance is provided when it is anticipated that cost will exceed net
realizable value plus a reasonable profit margin. Property
and Equipment Property
and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful
lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the useful life of the
improvement, or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Provision for
depreciation of property and equipment is calculated primarily on a
straight-line basis. The Company capitalizes interest on borrowings during the
active construction period of major capital projects. Capitalized interest,
when incurred, is added to the cost of underlying assets and is amortized over
the estimated useful life of such assets. The Company did not incur any
capitalized interest related to major capital projects in the periods
presented. The cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization and estimated
useful lives are summarized as follows in thousands

As
of December31, 2008, the Company had $143 million net of accumulated
depreciation of $80 million in lease and rental vehicles under various
capital leases included in property and equipment. The charge to income resulting from amortization
of these assets recorded under capital leases is included in lease and rental
cost of products sold. Goodwill Goodwill
related to acquisitions was approximately $1419million as of December31,
2008 and $1206 million as of December31, 2007. Goodwill increased $214 million in 2008 and
$35 million in 2007. Accumulated
amortization of goodwill was approximately $38 million at December31,
2008 and December31, 2007. Goodwill
represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets
acquired. The Company applies the
provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards the FASB Statement
No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142, in our
accounting for goodwill. SFAS 142
requires that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives
not be amortized but instead be tested at 47 Table of
Contents least
annually by reporting unit for impairment, or more frequently when events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. For indefinite lived intangible assets,
impairment is tested by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the fair
value of the reporting unit, which is the same as the segment to which they are
assigned. For its goodwill
impairment tests, the Company determines the fair value of its reporting units
using the discounted cash flow method.
The discounted cash flow method uses various assumptions and estimates
regarding future revenue, expenses and cash flow projections. The analysis is based upon available
information regarding expected future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted
at rates consistent with the cost of capital specific to the reporting
unit. If the carrying amount of the
reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value determined using the discounted
cash flow method, then goodwill impairment may be present. Goodwill was tested for
impairment during the fourth quarter of 2008 and no impairment write down was
required. However, the Company cannot
predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the
reported value of goodwill in the future.
Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions
made in response to economic and competitive conditions or the impact of the
current economic environment. Other
Assets Other
assets include the long-term portion of notes receivable of $02 million at December31,
2008 and $07 million at December31, 2007. The Company recognizes interest income on
notes receivable monthly as earned.
Accumulated amortization of other assets was approximately $10 million
at December31, 2008 and $09 million at December31, 2007. The Company annually assesses the
appropriateness of the asset valuations of other assets and the related
amortization period as applicable. Income Taxes Significant management judgment is required to determine the provisions
for income taxes and to determine whether deferred tax assets will be realized
in full or in part. Deferred income tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled.
When it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific
deferred income tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be
established for the amount of deferred income tax assets that are determined
not to be realizable. The Company has a
valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets in certain states. Accordingly, the facts and financial
circumstances impacting state deferred income tax assets are reviewed quarterly
and managements judgment is applied to determine the amount of valuation
allowance required in any given period. Additionally,
despite the Companys belief that its tax return positions are consistent with
applicable tax law, management believes that certain positions may be
challenged by taxing authorities.
Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete
disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations. The Company adopted FASB
Interpretation48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48, effective January1,
2007. FIN 48 prescribes how a company should recognize, measure, present
and disclose uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to
take in its income tax returns. FIN 48
requires that only income tax benefits meeting the more likely than not
recognition threshold be recognized or continue to be recognized on its
effective date. Revenue
Recognition Policies Income
on the sale of a vehicle or a piece of construction equipment each a unit
is recognized when the seller and customer execute a purchase contract,
delivery has occurred and there are no significant uncertainties related to
financing or collectibility. Finance income related to the sale of a unit is
recognized 48 Table of
Contents over
the period of the respective finance contract, based on the effective interest
rate method, if the finance contract is retained by the Company. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, no finance
contracts were retained for any significant length of time by the Company but
were generally sold, with limited recourse, to certain finance companies
concurrent with the sale of the related unit. Gain or loss is recognized by the
Company upon the sale of such finance contracts to the finance companies, net
of a provision for estimated repossession losses and early repayment penalties.
Lease and rental income is recognized over the period of the related lease or
rental agreement. Parts and services revenue is earned at the time the Company
sells the parts to its customers or at the time the Company completes the
service work order related to service provided to the customers unit. Payments
received on prepaid maintenance plans are deferred as a component of accrued
expenses and recognized as income when the maintenance is performed. Cost
of Sales For
the Companys new and used truck and construction equipment operations and its
parts operations, cost of sales consists primarily of the Companys actual
purchase price, less manufacturers incentives, for new and used trucks and
construction equipment and parts. The Company is subject to a chargeback of
manufacturer incentives for trucks that are not sold to the customer for which they
were ordered. The Company records a
liability for a potential chargeback of manufacturer incentives in its
financial statements. For the Companys
service and body shop operations, technician labor cost is the primary
component of cost of sales. For the Companys rental and leasing operations,
cost of sales consists primarily of depreciation, rent and interest expense on
the lease and rental fleet owned and leased by the Company, and the maintenance
cost of the lease and rental fleet. There are no costs of sales associated with
the Companys finance and insurance revenue or other revenue. Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses Selling,
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of incentive-based
compensation for sales, finance and general management personnel, salaries for
administrative personnel and expenses for rent, marketing, insurance,
utilities, shipping and handling costs and other general operating purposes. Stock
Based Compensation The Company accounts for
stock-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment, SFAS 123R,
which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all
share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including grants of
stock options, restricted stock awards and employee stock purchases under the
Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on estimated fair values. The Company adopted SFAS
123Rusing the modified prospective transition method, which requires
the application of the accounting standard as of January1, 2006. The Companys Consolidated Financial
Statements reflect the impact of SFAS 123R. SFAS 123Rrequires
companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date
of grant using an option-pricing model.
The fair value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected
to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the Companys
Consolidated Statements of Income. Stock-based compensation
expense recognized is based on the fair value of the portion of share-based
payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in
the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December31,
2008, 2007 and 2006 included compensation expense for share-based payment
awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of December31, 2005, based
on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma
provisions of SFAS 123 and compensation expense for the share-based payment
awards granted subsequent to December31, 2005, based on the grant date
fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS
123R, compensation expense for all share-based payment awards is recognized
using the straight-line single-option method.
As stock-based 49 Table
of Contents compensation expense recognized in the
Consolidated Statements of Income is based on awards ultimately expected to
vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS 123Rrequires forfeitures to be estimated
at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company uses the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model which was previously used for the Companys
pro forma information required under SFAS 123. For additional information, see
Note 12. The Companys determination of fair value of share-based payment
awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by the
Companys stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly
complex and subjective variables. These
variables include, but are not limited to, the Companys expected stock price
volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected stock option
exercise behaviors. Option-pricing
models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that
have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable. Because the Companys stock options have
certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options,
and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the
estimated value, in managements opinion, the existing valuation models may not
provide an accurate measure of the fair value of the Companys stock
options. Although the fair value of
stock options is determined in accordance with SFAS 123Rusing an
option-pricing model, that value may not be indicative of the fair value
observed in a market transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller. The following table
reflects the weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during each
period using the Black-Scholes option valuation model with the following

The Company computes its
historical stock price volatility in accordance with SFAS 123R. The risk-free interest rate for periods
within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield
curve in effect at the time of grant.
The dividend yield assumption is based on the Companys history and
expectation of dividend payouts. The
expected life of stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock
options are expected to remain outstanding. Advertising
Costs Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred.
Advertising and marketing expense related to operations was $36 million
for 2008, $42 million for 2007 and $31 million for 2006. Advertising and
marketing expense is included in selling, general and administrative expense. Accounting for Internal
Use Software The American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for
the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use SOP
98-1 in March1998. SOP 98-1 provides guidance on accounting for
the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and
identifies characteristics of internal-use software. The Companys
accounting policy with respect to accounting for computer software developed or
obtained for internal use is consistent with SOP 98-1. The Company has
capitalized software costs of approximately $209 million at December31,
2008, and $119 million at December31, 2007. 50 Table of
Contents New Accounting
Pronouncements In December2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No141R, Business Combinations SFAS141R,
which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: arecognizes
and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the
liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; brecognizes
and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a
bargain purchase; and cdetermines what information to disclose to
enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial
effects of the business combination. SFAS 141Rrequires contingent
consideration to be recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date and,
for certain arrangements, changes in fair value to be recognized in earnings
until settled.SFAS 141Ralso requires acquisition-related
transaction and restructuring costs to be expensed rather than treated as part
of the cost of the acquisition.SFAS141Rapplies
prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15,
2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 141Rto
have a significant impact on its consolidated results of operations and
financial position, but will impact any business combinations that close on or after
January1, 2009. In June2008, the
FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments
Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities.
EITF 03-6-1 requires unvested share-based payment awards that contain
non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents to be treated as participating securities as defined
in EITF Issue No03-6, Participating Securities and the Two-ClassMethod
under FASB Statement No128, and, therefore, included in the earnings
allocation in computing earnings per share under the two-class method described
in FASB Statement No128, Earnings per Share. Upon adoption, all previously reported
earnings per share data should be adjusted retrospectively to conform with the
requirements of EITF 03-6-1. The Company
is required to adopt EITF 03-6-1 starting in 2009. The Company does not
expect EITF 03-6-1 to have an effect on its consolidated financial statements. 3. SUPPLIER AND CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION Major
Suppliers and Dealership Agreements The
Company has entered into dealership agreements with various manufacturers of
vehicles and construction equipment Manufacturers. These agreements are
nonexclusive agreements that allow the Company to stock, sell at retail and
service trucks, equipment and products of the Manufacturers in the Companys
defined market. The agreements allow the Company to use the Manufacturers
names, trade symbols and intellectual property and expire as follows

These
agreements, as well as agreements with various other Manufacturers, impose a
number of restrictions and obligations on the Company, including restrictions
on a change in control of the Company and the maintenance of certain required
levels of working capital. Violation of these restrictions could result in the
loss of the Companys right to purchase the Manufacturers products and use the
Manufacturers trademarks. 51 Table of
Contents The
Company purchases its new Peterbilt vehicles and most of its parts from PACCAR,
the maker of Peterbilt trucks and parts, at prevailing prices charged to all
franchised dealers. Sales of new Peterbilt
trucks accounted for approximately 83% of the Companys new vehicle sales for
the year ended December31, 2008, and December31, 2007. The
Company purchases most of its new construction equipment and parts from John
Deere at prevailing prices charged to all franchised dealers. Sales of new John
Deere equipment accounted for approximately 866% of the Companys new
equipment sales for the year ended December31, 2008, and 915% of the
Companys new equipment sales for the year ended December31, 2007. Primary
Lenders The
Company purchases its new and used vehicle and construction equipment
inventories with the assistance of floor plan financing programs offered by
various financial institutions and John Deere.
Additional floor plan financing is provided by John Deere pursuant to
the Companys equipment dealership agreement. These agreements provide that the
occurrence of certain events will be considered events of default. There were
no known events of default as of December31, 2008. In the event that the
Companys financing becomes insufficient, or its relationship with the current
primary lenders terminates, the Company would need to obtain similar financing
from other sources. Management believes it can obtain additional floor plan
financing or alternative financing if necessary. The
Companys debt agreements include certain restrictive covenants. The Company
was in compliance with these and all debt covenants as of December31,
2008. Concentrations of Credit Risks Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts
receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with what it
considers to be quality financial institutions.
As of December31, 2008, the Company had deposits in excess of
federal insurance protection totaling approximately $296 million. The
Company controls credit risk through credit approvals and by selling a majority
of its trade receivables without recourse.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are
reduced because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the
Companys customer base, thus spreading the trade credit risk. A majority of
the Companys business, however, is concentrated in the United States heavy-
and medium-duty truck and construction equipment markets and related
aftermarkets. The
Company generally sells finance contracts it enters into with customers to
finance the purchase of trucks or construction equipment to third parties. These finance contracts are sold both with
and without recourse. A majority of the
Companys finance contracts are sold without recourse. The Company provides an
allowance for doubtful receivables and a reserve for repossession losses
related to finance contracts sold.
Historically, the Companys allowance and reserve have covered losses
inherent in these receivables. 4. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE The

53 Table of
Contents Allowance for Doubtful Receivables The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible warranty
receivables. The Company evaluates the collectibility of its warranty claims
receivable based on a combination of factors, including aging and
correspondence with the applicable manufacturer. Management reviews the
warranty claims receivable aging and adjusts the allowance based on historical
experience. The Company records charge-offs related to warranty receivables on
an as-needed basis. The Company sells a
majority of its customer accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to a third
party that is responsible for qualifying the customer for credit at the point
of sale. If the third party approves the
customer for credit, then the third party assumes all credit risk related to
the transaction. Inventory The
Company provides a reserve for obsolete and slow moving parts. The reserve is
reviewed and, if necessary, adjustments are made on a quarterly basis. The
Company relies on historical information to support its reserve. Once the
inventory is written down, the Company does not adjust the reserve balance
until the inventory is sold. The
valuation for new and used truck and equipment inventory is based on specific
identification. A detail of new and used truck and equipment inventory is
reviewed and, if necessary, adjustments to the value of specific units are made
on a quarterly basis. 7. FLOOR PLAN NOTES
PAYABLE AND LINES OF CREDIT Floor Plan Notes Payable Floor plan notes are financing agreements to facilitate the Companys
purchase of new and used trucks and construction equipment. These notes are
collateralized by the inventory purchased and accounts receivable arising from
the sale thereof. The Companys floor plan notes have interest rates based on
the prime rate or LIBOR, as defined in the agreements. The interest rates
applicable to these agreements ranged from approximately 175% to 475% as of December31,
2008. Amounts borrowed under these agreements are due when the related truck or
construction equipment inventory collateral is sold and the sales proceeds
are collected by the Company, or in the case of construction equipment rentals,
when the carrying value of the equipment is reduced. These agreements may be
modified, suspended or terminated by the lender as described in Note 3. The Company finances substantially all of the purchase price of its new
truck inventory, and the loan value of its used truck inventory under a floor
plan financing agreement with GE Capital, under which GE Capital pays the
manufacturer directly with respect to new trucks. On December31, 2008, the Company had
approximately $2660 million outstanding under its floor plan financing
agreement with GE Capital. The Companys floor plan agreement with Chase is based on the book
value of the Companys construction equipment inventory. As of December31,
2008, the aggregate amount of borrowing capacity with this lender was $200 million,
with approximately $130million outstanding. Additional amounts are
available for construction equipment inventory purchases under the Companys
John Deere dealership agreement. At December31,
2008, approximately $37million was outstanding pursuant to the John
Deere dealership agreement. 54 Table of Contents Assets pledged as collateral as

Lines of Credit The Company may
request working capital advances in the minimum amount of $100,000 from GE
Capital, its primary truck lender.
However, such working capital advances may not cause the total
indebtedness owed GE Capital to exceed an amount equal to the wholesale
advances made against the then current inventory less any payment reductions
owed to GE Capital. There were no
working capital advances outstanding under this agreement at December31,
2008. The Company has a secured line of
credit that provides for a maximum borrowing of $80 million. There were no advances outstanding under this
secured line of credit at December31, 2008, however, $59 million was
pledged to secure various letters of credit related to self-insurance products,
leaving $21 million available for future borrowings as of December31,

The interest rates on the Companys variable interest rate notes are
based on LIBOR. The interest rates on
the notes range from approximately 268% to 294% on December31,
2008. Payments on the notes range from
$12,578 to $24,667 per month, plus interest.
Maturities of these notes range from December2012 to December2013. 55 Table of
Contents The Companys fixed interest rate notes are primarily with financial
institutions and had interest rates that ranged from approximately 366% to
850% on December31, 2008.
Payments on the notes range from $168 to $76,196 per month, plus
interest. Maturities of these notes
range from January2009 to September2016. The proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used primarily to
acquire land, buildings and improvements, transportation equipment and leasing
vehicles. The notes are secured by the
assets acquired with the proceeds of such notes. The
Companys long-term debt agreements require the Company to satisfy various financial ratios. At December31, 2008, the Company is in
compliance with all debt covenants. We
do not anticipate any breach of the covenants in the foreseeable future. 9. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in
estimating the fair value of financial instruments at December31, 2008 The
carrying value of current assets and current liabilities approximates the fair
value due to the short maturity of these items. The
fair value of the Companys long-term debt is based on secondary market
indicators. Since the Companys debt is
not quoted, estimates are based on each obligations characteristics, including
remaining maturities, interest rate, credit rating, collateral, amortization
schedule and liquidity. The carrying
amount approximates fair value. 10. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION
PLAN The Company has a defined contribution plan the Rush 401K Plan,
which is available to all Company employees and the employees of certain
affiliates. Each employee who has completed 90 days of continuous service is
entitled to enter the Rush 401K Plan on the first day of the following month.
Participating employees may contribute from 1% to 50% of total gross
compensation. However, certain higher paid employees are limited to a maximum
contribution of 15% of total gross compensation. For the first 10% of an
employees contribution, the Company, at its discretion, may contribute an
amount equal to 25% of the employees contributions for those employees with
less than five years of service and an amount equal to 50% of the employees
contributions for those employees with more than five years of service. The
Company incurred expenses related to the Rush 401K Plan of approximately $34
million during the year ended December31, 2008, $36 million during the
year ended December31, 2007, and $31 million during the year ended December31,
2006. The Company currently does not provide any postretirement benefits nor
does it provide any post employment benefits. 11. LEASING ACTIVITIES Vehicle
Leases as Lessee The
Company leases vehicles, as lessee, primarily over periods ranging from one to
ten years under operating lease and capital lease arrangements. As discussed
below, these vehicles are then subleased by the Company to customers under
various agreements. Future minimum
sublease rentals to be received by the Company under non-cancelable subleases,
as described below, are $340 million.
Generally, the Company is required to incur all operating costs and pay
a minimum rental. The Company guarantees the residual value of
vehicles under operating lease and capital lease arrangements. At December31, 2008, the Company
guaranteed vehicle residual values of $69 million under operating lease
arrangements and $61 million under capital lease arrangements. Historically, the Company purchases these
vehicles at the end of the lease term and recognizes a gain on the sale of the
vehicle. The residual values are not
reflected in the 56 Table of
Contents future
minimum lease payments for operating leases.
Vehicle lease expenses were approximately $44 million for the year
ended December31, 2008, $48 million for the year ended December31,
2007, and $48 million for the year ended December31, 2006. Future

12. STOCK OPTIONS AND
INCENTIVE PLANS Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan that allows eligible
employees to contribute up to 10% of their base earnings toward the semi-annual
purchase of the Companys ClassA common stock. The employees purchase
price is 85% of the lesser of the closing price of the ClassA common
stock on the first business day or the last business day of the semi-annual
offering period, as reported by The NASDAQ Global Select MarketSM. Employees may purchase
shares having a fair market value of up to $25,000 measured as of the first
day of each semi-annual offering period for each calendar year. Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
900,000 shares of the Companys ClassA common stock have been reserved
for issuance. The Company issued 54,532
shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan during the year ended December31,
2008 and 58,713 shares during the year ended December31, 2007. Of the 2,706 employees eligible to
participate, 287 were participants in the plan as of December31, 2008. Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan On May16, 2006, the Board of Directors and shareholders adopted
the Rush Enterprises,Inc. 2006 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan
the Director Plan, reserving 1,500,000 shares of ClassA common stock
for issuance upon exercise of any awards granted under the Plan. This Director
Plan was Amended and Restated on May20, 2008 to expand the type of award
that may be granted under the plan to include ClassA common stock awards. The Director Plan is designed to attract and retain highly qualified
non-employee directors. Historically,
each non-employee director received options to purchase 20,000 shares of the
Companys ClassA common stock upon their respective date of appointment
and each year on the date that they are elected or reelected by the
shareholders to serve on the Board of Directors. Each option has a ten year term from the
grant date and vested immediately. In
2008, in lieu of options, each non-employee director received an outright grant
of 7,566 shares of the Companys ClassA common stock on the date that
they were reelected by the shareholders to serve on the Board of Directors. Under the Director Plan, 1,500,000 shares of the Companys ClassA
common stock have been reserved for issuance.
The Company granted 30,264 shares of ClassA common stock under the
Director Plan during the year ended December31, 2008 and 120,000 options
to purchase ClassA common stock under the Director Plan during the year
ended December31, 2007. Employee Incentive Plans In
May2007, the Board of Directors and shareholders adopted the Rush
Enterprises,Inc. 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2007 Incentive Plan.
The 2007 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of stock options which may be
nonqualified stock options or incentive stock options for tax purposes, stock
appreciation rights issued independent of or in tandem with such options SARs,
restricted stock awards and performance awards.
The 2007 Incentive Plan replaced the Rush Enterprises,Inc.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Incentive Plan effective May22, 2007. 58 Table of
Contents The aggregate number of shares of common stock subject to stock options
or SARs that may be granted to any one participant in any year under the 2007
Incentive Plan is 100,000shares of ClassA common stock or 100,000
shares of ClassB common stock.
Each option has a ten year term from the grant date and vests in three
equal annual installments beginning on the third anniversary of the grant
date. The Company has 2,550,000 shares
of ClassA common stock and 450,000 shares of ClassB common stock

REPURCHASE PLAN Stock
Dividend On September20, 2007, our shareholders
approved an amendment to our Restated Articles of Incorporation increasing the
total number of authorized shares of ClassA common stock from 40,000,000
to 60,000,000 and total number of authorized shares of ClassB common
stock from 10,000,000 to 20,000,000. On
the same date, our Board of Directors declared a 3-for-2 stock split of the ClassA
common stock and ClassB common stock, to be effected in the form of a
stock dividend. On October10, 2007, Rush Enterprises,Inc.
distributed one additional share of stock for every two shares of ClassA
common stock and ClassB common stock held by shareholders of record as of
October1, 2007. All share and per
share data except par value in this Form10-K have been adjusted and
restated to reflect the stock dividend as if it occurred on the first day of
the earliest period presented. Stock Repurchase Plan On July22, 2008,
the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program
authorizing the Company to repurchase, from time to time, up to an aggregate of
$20,000,000 of its shares of ClassA common stock and/or ClassB common
stock. Repurchases will be made at times
and in amounts as the Company deems appropriate and will be made through open
market transactions, privately negotiated transactions and other lawful means.
The manner, timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by the
Company based on an evaluation of market conditions, stock price and other
factors, including those related to the ownership requirements of its
dealership agreements with manufacturers it represents. The stock repurchase
program has no expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any
time. While the stock repurchase program
does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount or class of
common stock, the Company anticipates that it will be repurchasing primarily
shares of its ClassB common stock. As of December31,
2008, the Company repurchased 1,639,843 shares of ClassB common stock at
a cost of $179 million. The Company is
holding the repurchased shares of the common stock as treasury stock and is
accounting for the treasury stock pursuant to the cost method. The Company includes treasury stock as a
component of stockholders equity. 14. EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share EPS were computed by dividing net income
by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted EPS differs from basic EPS due to the assumed conversions of
potentially dilutive options and warrants that were outstanding during the
period. The Companys ClassA common stock
and ClassB common stock have equal claims on earnings of the
Company. The following is a reconciliation
of the numerators and the denominators of the basic and diluted per share
computations for net income. Share and
per share data for 2006 has been adjusted and restated to reflect the stock dividend discussed
above. 61 Table of

The Company included
accruals for unrecognized income tax benefits totaling $19 million as a
component of accrued liabilities as of December31, 2008 and $20 million
as of December31, 2007. The
unrecognized tax benefits of $19 million at December31, 2008, if
recognized, would impact the Companys effective tax rate. As of December31, 2008, the Company
accrued interest of $185,000 related to unrecognized tax benefits in the
current provision for income taxes. No
amounts were accrued for penalties. The Company does not
anticipate a significant change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits in
the next 12 months. As of December31,
2008, the tax years ended December31, 2005, through 2008 remained subject
to examination by tax authorities. The
U.S. Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the Companys federal
income tax return for the tax year 2005. 63 Table of

16. COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENCIES The Company is contingently liable to finance
companies for certain notes initiated on behalf of such finance companies
related to the sale of trucks and construction equipment. The majority of finance contracts are sold
without recourse against the Company. A majority of the Companys liability
related to finance contracts sold with recourse is generally limited to 5% to
20% of the outstanding amount of each note initiated on behalf of the finance
company. The Company provides for an
allowance for repossession losses and early repayment penalties that it may be
liable for under finance contracts sold without recourse. The Company is involved in
various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.
The Company believes it is unlikely that the final outcome of any of the claims
or proceedings to which the Company is a party would have a material adverse
effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations; however,
due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that
the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material
adverse effect on the Companys results of operations for the fiscal period in
which such resolution occurred. During the second quarter
of 2007, the Company renegotiated its contractual obligations with its retail
funding sources regarding early repayment penalties, which occur as a result of
a premature termination of finance contracts sold by the Company. As a
result of these negotiations, the Company expects to decrease the amount of
finance income it will recognize at the time the contract is sold and to
decrease the amount of early repayment penalties it will owe its retail funding
sources in the future. In 2006, the Company signed an agreement
with Titan Technology Partners to implement SAP enterprise software and a new SAP
dealership management system. The cost
of the SAP software and implementation is estimated at $300 million to $320
million, of which $209 million was expended at December31, 2008. 17. ACQUISITIONS All
of the following acquisitions, unless otherwise noted, were considered business
combinations accounted for under SFAS 141. In June2008, the Company acquired certain

investments for impairment. If the
investments are deemed to be impaired, the Company determines whether the impairment
is temporary or other than temporary. If
the impairment is deemed to be temporary, the Company records an unrealized
loss in other comprehensive income. If
the impairment is deemed other than temporary, the Company records the
impairment in the Companys consolidated statement of income. The Company historically invested in
interest-bearing short-term investments primarily consisting of
investment-grade auction rate securities classified as available-for-sale and
reported at fair value. These types of
investments were designed to provide liquidity through an auction process that
reset the applicable interest rates at predetermined periods ranging from 1 to
35 days. This reset mechanism was
intended to allow existing investors to continue to own their respective
interest in the auction rate security or to gain immediate liquidity by selling
their interests at par. As a result of the recent liquidity issues
experienced in the global capital markets, auctions for investment grade
securities held by the Company have failed.
An auction fails when there is insufficient demand. However, a failed auction does not represent
a default by the issuer. The auction
rate securities continue to pay interest in accordance with the terms of the
underlying security; however, liquidity will be limited until there is a
successful auction or until such time as other markets for these investments
develop. The Company believes that its
auction rate securities will liquidate within the next twelve months and has
classified them as a current asset on its consolidated balance sheet. The Company has the intent and ability to
hold these auction rate securities until liquidity returns to the market. The Company does not believe that the lack of
liquidity relating to its auction rate securities will have a material impact
on its ability to fund operations. As of December31, 2007, the Company did not
carry any short-term investments, as its previous practice had been to
liquidate its short-term investments, including auction rate securities near
the end of each fiscal quarter. However,
as of December31, 2008, the Company holds $76 million of auction rate
securities with underlying tax-exempt municipal bonds with stated maturities of
22 years. These bonds have credit wrap
insurance and have been rated AAA by credit agencies. The Company believes that the credit quality and
fair value of the auction rate securities it holds has not been negatively
impacted; therefore, no impairment charges have been recorded as of December31,
2008. As of December31, 2008, the
Company has valued these investments at fair value, which approximates
cost. The Company used observable inputs
to determine fair value, including consideration of broker quotes, the overall
quality of the underlying municipality, the credit quality of the insurance
company, as well as successful subsequent auctions. Accordingly, the Company has considered this
fair value to be a Level 2 valuation under SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurement. If the credit quality of these
investments deteriorates, or adverse developments occur in the bond insurance
market, the Company may be required to record an impairment charge on these
investments in the future. 67 Table of Contents 19. UNAUDITED

20. SEGMENTS The
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information SFAS131. This statement requires that public
business enterprises report certain information about operating segments in
complete sets of financial statements of the enterprise and in condensed
financial statements of interim periods issued to shareholders. It also
requires that public business enterprises report certain information about
their products and services, the geographic areas in which they operate, and
their major customers. The
Company currently has two reportable business segments: the Truck segment and
the Construction Equipment segment. The Truck segment operates a regional
network of truck centers that provide an integrated one-stop source for the
trucking needs of its customers, including retail sales of new and used heavy-
and medium-duty trucks; aftermarket parts, service and body shop facilities;
and a wide array of financial services, including the financing of new and used
truck purchases, insurance products and truck leasing and rentals. The
Construction Equipment segment operates a full-service John Deere dealership that
serves the Houston, Texas area.
Construction Equipment dealership operations include the retail sale of
new and used construction equipment, aftermarket parts and service facilities,
equipment rentals, and the financing of new and used construction equipment. The
accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates performance
based on income before income taxes not including extraordinary items. The
Company accounts for intersegment sales and transfers as if the sales or
transfers were to third parties, that is, at current market prices. There were
no material intersegment sales during the years ended December31, 2008,
2007 and 2006. The
Companys reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different
products and services. They are managed separately because each business unit
