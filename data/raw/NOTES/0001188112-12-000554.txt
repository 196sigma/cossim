ITEM 8.CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Page Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 51 Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31, 2011 and 2010 52 Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 53 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity Deficit and Comprehensive Loss for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 54 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 55 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 56  50  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of ArQule,Inc. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders equity deficit and comprehensive loss, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ArQule,Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011 based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopersLLP Boston, Massachusetts

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA 1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company organized as a Delaware corporation in 1993 engaged in the research and development of innovative cancer therapeutics. Our mission is to produce noveldrugs with differentiated mechanisms of action that will extend the lives of our patients. These drugs target biological pathways implicated in a wide range of cancers. We employ technologies such as our ArQule Kinase Inhibitor Platform AKIPTM to design and develop drugs that have the potential to fulfill this mission. Our lead product candidate is tivantinib ARQ197, an orally administered, small molecule inhibitor of the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met. C-Met is a promising target for cancer therapy, based on its multiple roles in cancerous cell proliferation, tumor spread, new blood vessel formation and resistance to certain drug therapies. We and our partners, Daiichi SankyoCo.,Ltd. Daiichi Sankyo and Kyowa Hakko KirinCo.,Ltd., Kyowa Hakko Kirin are implementing a clinical development program designed to realize the broad potential of tivantinib as a well-tolerated single agent and in combination with other anti-cancer therapies in a number of disease indications. Our strategy is to focus on the most promising indications within our clinical programs based upon data that is continually generated.Our leading indications include non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC, liver cancer hepatocellular carcinoma or HCC and colorectal cancer. We are also completing earlier-stage combination therapy trials with tivantinib and other anti-cancer agents that may provide data to support later-stage trials in additional indications. In January 2011, we enrolled the first patient in the Phase3 MARQUEE Met inhibitor ARQ 197 plus Erlotinib vs. Erlotinib plus placebo in NSCLC trial of tivantinib in NSCLC in combination with erlotinib, an approved anti-cancer agent. The Phase3 trial is a randomized, double-blinded, controlled study of previously treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic, non-squamous NSCLC who will receive tivantinib plus erlotinib or placebo plus erlotinib. This trial is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment SPA agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA. In August 2011, Kyowa Hakko Kirin announced the initiation of the Phase 3 ATTENTION Asian Trial of Tivantinib plus Erlotinib vs. Erlotinib for NSCLC without EGFR Mutation trial of tivantinib in combination with erlotinib.The ATTENTION trial is a randomized, double-blinded, controlled study of previously treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with the wild type form of the EGFR gene who will receive tivantinib plus erlotinib or placebo plus erlotinib. On November 10, 2011, we and Daiichi Sankyo announced the execution of a license agreement for the development of a new AKT inhibitor, ARQ 092, the first compound to emerge from the companies AKIP collaboration.The license agreement provides exclusive rights to Daiichi Sankyo for the development, manufacturing and marketing of ARQ 092 on a worldwide basis.Under this agreement, we received a $10 million upfront fee from Daiichi Sankyo in November 2011. Our proprietary pipeline is directed toward molecular targets and biological processes with demonstrated roles in the development of human cancers. The most advanced candidates in this pipeline are ARQ 621, an inhibitor of the Eg5 kinesin motor protein, and ARQ 736, an inhibitor of the RAF kinases, both of which are in Phase1 clinical testing. A third pipeline program, focused on small molecule inhibitors of fibroblast growth factor receptor, is in pre-clinical development. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of these financial statements are as follows Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities We consider all highly liquid investments purchased within three months of original maturity date to be cash equivalents. We invest our available cash primarily in U.S. Treasury bill funds, money market funds, commercial paper, and U.S. federal and state agency backed certificates, including auction rate securities that have investment grade ratings. Auction rate securities are structured with short-term interest reset dates of generally less than 90days, but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years. At the end of each reset period, which occurs every seven to twenty-eight days, investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par value. Our auction rate securities are classified as trading securities. We generally classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and re-evaluate such designation as of each consolidated balance sheet date. The Company classifies its investments as either current or long-term based upon the investments contractual maturities and the Companys ability and intent to convert such instruments to cash within one year. We report available-for-sale investments at fair value as of each balance sheet date and include any unrealized gains and, to the extent deemed temporary, unrealized losses in stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are included in other income expense in the statement of operations. Certain of our marketable securities are classified as trading securities and any changes in the fair value of those securities are recorded as other income expense in the statement of operations.  56  We conduct quarterly reviews to determine the fair value of our investment portfolio and to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to certain investments. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. In the event that the cost basis of a security exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, the duration of the period that, and extent to which, the fair value is less than cost basis, the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, and operational and financing cash flow factors, overall market conditions and trends, our intent to sell the investment and if it is more likely than not that we would be required to sell the investment before its anticipated recovery. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, we perform an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis. Where we intend to sell a security, or may be required to do so, the securitys decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as an impairment loss. Regardless of our intent to sell a security, we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security. Credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security. Fair Value of Financial Instruments At December31, 2011 and 2010 our financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates their fair values. At December31, 2011 and 2010 our financial instruments also included marketable securities which are reported at fair value. Non-refundable Advance Payments for Research and Development Non-refundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are initially deferred and capitalized. Related expenses or contra-revenues are then recognized as expense or contra-revenue as the goods are delivered and consumed or the related services are performed. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Assets under capital leases and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of the respective leases by use of the straight-line method. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Revenue RecognitionResearch and Development Revenue Research and development revenue is generated primarily through collaborative research and development agreements. The terms of the agreements may include nonrefundable upfront payments, funding for research and development, milestone payments and royalties on any product sales derived from collaborations. Research and development payments associated with our collaboration agreements in effect prior to January 1, 2011 are recognized as research and development revenue using the contingency adjusted performance model. Under this model, when payments are earned, revenue is immediately recognized on a pro-rata basis in the period we achieve the milestone based on the time elapsed from inception of the agreement to the time the milestone is earned over the estimated duration of the development period under the agreement. Thereafter, the remaining portion of the milestone payment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated development period under the agreement. This estimated development period may ultimately be shorter or longer depending upon the outcome of the development work, resulting in accelerated or deferred recognition of the development revenue. Royalty payments will be recognized as revenue when earned. The costs associated with satisfying research and development contracts are included in research and development expense as incurred.  57  On November 10, 2011, we and Daiichi Sankyo announced the execution of a license agreement for the development of a new AKT inhibitor, ARQ 092.The license agreement provides exclusive rights to Daiichi Sankyo for the development, manufacturing and marketing of ARQ 092 on a worldwide basis. Revenue for this agreement is recognized using Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13,Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements ASU 2009-13.Under ASU 2009-13 all undelivered items under an agreement are divided into separate units of accounting based on whether the deliverable provides stand-alone value to the licensee. The Company determines the best estimate selling price BESP for each unit of accountingbased upon managements judgment and including factors such as discounted cash flows, estimated direct expenses and other costs and probability of successful outcome of clinical trials. Research and Development Costs Costs of internal research and development, which are expensed as incurred, are comprised of the following types of costs incurred in performing research and development activities and those incurred in connection with research and development revenue: salaries and benefits, allocated overhead and occupancy costs, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs, contract services, and other outside costs. Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets We assess our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances a triggering event indicate that the carrying value of a group of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, including its eventual residual value, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written-down to their estimated fair values. We did not recognize an impairment charges related to our long-lived assets during 2011, 2010 and 2009. Segment Data The chief operating decision maker uses consolidated financial information in determining how to allocate resources and assess performance. For this reason, we have determined that we are principally engaged in one operating segment. See Note13 with respect to significant customers. Substantially all of our revenue since inception has been generated in the United States and all of our long-lived assets are located in the United States. Other Income Other income in 2011 includes a $20 gain from the increase in fair value of our auction rate securities Other income in 2010 includes a $4,362 gain from the increase in fair value of our auction rate securities and a $5,074 loss from the decrease in fair value of our Put Option upon exercise. Other income in 2010 also includes $978 of cash grants for qualifying therapeutic discovery projects that were awarded under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Other income in 2009 includes an unrealized gain on our auction rate securities of $3,204 partially offset by a loss of $1,610 on our auction rate security Put Option. Income Taxes Income taxes have been accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded if, based upon the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. For uncertain tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold, the Company recognizes the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the consolidated financial statements.  58  Earnings Loss Per Share The computations of basic and diluted earnings loss per common share are based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive securities. Potentially dilutive securities include stock options. Options to purchase 6,547,443, 6,355,827 and 5,215,189 shares of common stock were not included in the 2011, 2010 and 2009 computations of diluted net loss per share, respectively, because inclusion of such shares would have an anti-dilutive effect. Stock-Based Compensation Our stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the employees requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant. We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price of the award, expected option term, expected volatility of our stock over the options expected term, risk-free interest rate over the options expected term, and the expected annual dividend yield. We believe that the valuation technique and approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the fair values of our stock options granted in the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. The following table presents stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations  2011 2010 2009 Research and development 1,586 1,283 1,415 General and administrative 2,244 1,976 2,016 Total compensation expense 3,830 3,259 3,431 In the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, no stock-based compensation expense was capitalized and there were no recognized tax benefits associated with the stock-based compensation charge. The fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares granted in the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively were estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions  2011 2010 2009 Dividend yield1 00 00 00 Weighted average expected volatility factor2 64 64 61 Risk free interest3 10-22 14-23 18-24 Expected term, excluding options issued pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan4 56-64years 59-64years 58-64years Expected termEmployee Stock Purchase Plan5 6months 6months 6months  1 We have historically not paid dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.  2 Measured using an average of historical daily price changes of our stock over a period equal to our expected term. The weighted average expected volatility in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was approximately 64%, 64% and 61%, respectively. 3 The risk-free interest rate for periods equal to the expected term of share option based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant.  59   4 The expected term is the number of years that we estimate, based on historical experience, that options will be outstanding before exercise or cancellation. The range in expected term is the result of certain groups of employees exhibiting different exercising behavior.  5 The expected term of options issued in connection with our Employee Stock Purchase Plan is 6months based on the terms of the plan. Comprehensive Loss Comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and other comprehensive gain loss. Other comprehensive gain loss was $1, $62 and $55 in 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively, composed of unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued accounting standards update ASU No. 2009-13 Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements ASU 2009-13.ASU 2009-13 amended revenue recognition accounting pronouncements and provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the arrangement should be separated, and the consideration allocated. Among other provisions, this guidance eliminates the requirement to have objective evidence for undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon managements best estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item. Previous accounting principles required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately. Revenue from our multiple-deliverable arrangements in effect prior to January 1, 2011 is recognized over the estimated development period using the contingency adjusted performance model. Under the new approach, revenue for new agreements or material modifications of existing agreements will be recognized based upon the relative selling price of each element in the arrangement. The Company adopted this guidance prospectively on January1, 2011 and applied the amended revenue guidance to the license agreement entered into in November 2011 see Note 3, Collaborations and Alliances- Daiichi Sankyo ARQ 092 Agreement. In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No2010-17, Revenue RecognitionMilestone Method. This ASU provides guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate. Under the milestone method of revenue recognition, consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety can be recognized as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive. This standard provides the criteria to be met for a milestone to be considered substantive which includes that: aperformance consideration earned by achieving the milestone be commensurate with either performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from performance to achieve the milestone; and brelate to past performance and be reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement.The Company adopted this guidance on a prospective basis on January 1, 2011.The decision to use the milestone method of revenue recognition is a policy election.The new guidance may impact any new collaboration agreements or material modifications to existing agreements, in the event we elect the policy of utilizing the milestone method to recognize substantive milestones. In January2011, we adopted ASU No2010-06,Improving Disclosures About Fair Value Measurements which requires additional disclosure about the amounts of and reasons for significant transfers in and out of Level1 and Level2 fair value measurements. In addition, effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December15, 2010, which for us is January1, 2011, this standard further requires an entity to present disaggregated information about activity in Level3 fair value measurements on a gross basis, rather than as one net amount. As this accounting standard only requires enhanced disclosure, the adoption of this newly issued accounting standard did not impact our financial position or results of operations.  60  In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No2011-04, Fair Value Measurement Topic 820: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S.GAAP and IFRSs. This newly issued accounting standard clarifies the application of certain existing fair value measurement guidance and expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable Level3inputs. This ASU is effective on a prospective basis for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after December15, 2011, which for us is January1, 2012. We do not expect that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No2011-05, Comprehensive Income Topic 220. This newly issued accounting standard 1eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity; 2requires the consecutive presentation of the statement of net income and other comprehensive income; and 3requires an entity to present reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements from other comprehensive income to net income. The amendments in this ASU do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income nor do the amendments affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented. This ASU is required to be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December15, 2011, which for us is January1, 2012. As this accounting standard only requires enhanced disclosure, the adoption of this standard will not impact our financial position or results of operations. 3. COLLABORATIONS AND ALLIANCES Daiichi Sankyo Kinase Inhibitor Discovery Agreement On November7, 2008, we entered into a research collaboration, exclusive license and co-commercialization agreement with Daiichi Sankyo under which we are applying our proprietary technology and know-how using our AKIP technology for the discovery of therapeutic compounds that selectively inhibit certain kinases in the field of oncology. The agreement defines two such kinase targets, and Daiichi Sankyo will have an option to license compounds directed to these targets following the completion of certain pre-clinical studies. The agreement provides for a $15million upfront payment, which we received in November 2008, research support payments for the first two years of the collaboration which was extended for an additional two years in 2010, licensing fees for compounds discovered as a result of this research, milestone payments related to clinical development, regulatory review and sales, and royalty payments on net sales of compounds from the collaboration. We retain the option to co-commercialize licensed products developed under this agreement in the U.S. In May 2009, we entered into an agreement with Daiichi Sankyo related to potential future milestones and royalties for our AKIP collaboration, under which we could receive up to $265million in potential development and sales milestone payments for each product selected for clinical development. Upon commercialization of a licensed product, we would also receive tiered, double-digit royalties on its net sales. On October12, 2010, we and Daiichi Sankyo announced the expansion of this agreement, establishing a third target, with an option for a fourth, in oncology, and a two-year extension through November 2012. The duration and termination of the agreement are tied to future events. Unless earlier terminated due to breach, insolvency or upon 90days notice by Daiichi Sankyo, the agreement terminates on the later of ithe expiration of the research collaboration period, or iivarious periods specified in the agreement for development and commercialization of products. If Daiichi Sankyo has commercialized a licensed product or products, the agreement will continue in force until such time as all royalty terms for all licensed products have ended. The royalty term, on a country-by-country basis for a product, ends as of the later of ithe expiration of the last valid claim under a patent covering the manufacture, use, or sale of a licensed product or iia certain number of years from the date of the commercial sale of the licensed product in such country. Revenue for this agreement is recognized using the contingency-adjusted performance model with an estimated performance period through November 2012. For the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010, $177million and $126million, respectively, were recognized as revenue. At December31, 2011, $102million remains in deferred revenue. Daiichi Sankyo ARQ 092 Agreement On November 10, 2011, we and Daiichi Sankyo announced the execution of a license agreement for the development of a new AKT inhibitor, ARQ 092, the first compound to emerge from the companies AKIP collaboration.The license agreement provides exclusive rights to Daiichi Sankyo for the development, manufacturing and marketing of ARQ 092 on a worldwide basis.Under this agreement, we received a $10 million upfront fee from Daiichi Sankyo in November 2011.  61  Revenue for this agreement is recognized using Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13,Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements ASU 2009-13. Under ASU 2009-13 all undelivered items under the agreement are divided into separate units of accounting based on whether the deliverable provides stand-alone value to the licensee. These units of accounting consist of i the license to develop and commercialize ARQ 092, ii committed future clinical trial services, iii committed future clinical trial costs and ii steering committee services.The Company determined the best estimate selling price BESP for each unit of accountingbased upon managements judgment and including factors such as discounted cash flows, estimated direct expenses and other costs and probability of successful outcome of clinical trials. As the license granted under the agreement was delivered, the license had standalone value, and there were no further obligations related to the license, revenue of $100 million related to this accounting unit was recognized in 2011 based on the best estimate of selling price of the license.Revenue related to future clinical trial services, clinical trial costs and steering committee services will be recognized ratably over the clinical trial as amounts are incurred and billed, up to the amount of cash received for these deliverables based on the best estimate of selling price of each deliverable.We recognized revenue of $100 million related to this agreement for the year ended December 31, 2011and as of December31, 2011, there is no deferred revenue related to this arrangement. The estimated development period for this arrangement is through June 2013. Daiichi Sankyo Tivantinib Agreement On December18, 2008, we entered into a license, co-development and co-commercialization agreement with Daiichi Sankyo to conduct research, clinical trials and the commercialization of tivantinib in human cancer indications in the U.S., Europe, South America and the rest of the world, excluding Japan, China including Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan, where Kyowa Hakko Kirin has exclusive rights for development and commercialization. The agreement provides for a $60million cash upfront licensing payment from Daiichi Sankyo to us, which we received in December2008, and an additional $560million in potential development and sales milestone payments offset by our share of the Phase 3 costs. Upon commercialization, we will receive tiered, double-digit royalties from Daiichi Sankyo on net sales of tivantinib commensurate with the magnitude of the transaction. We retain the option to participate in the commercialization of tivantinib in the U.S. We and Daiichi Sankyo will share equally the costs of Phase2 and Phase3 clinical studies, with our share of Phase3 costs payable solely from milestone and royalty payments by Daiichi Sankyo. The dosing of the first patient in the Phase3 MARQUEE trial of tivantinib in NSCLC, announced in January2011, triggered the payment of a $25million development milestone from Daiichi Sankyo that was received in February2011. The milestone payment was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized as revenue using the contingency-adjusted performance model with an estimated development period through December2013. For year ended December31, 2011, $151 million was recognized as revenue from the milestone. In each quarter the tivantinib collaboration costs we incur are compared with those of Daiichi Sankyo. If our costs for the quarter exceed Daiichi Sankyos we recognize revenue on the amounts due to us under the contingency adjusted performance model. Revenue is calculated on a pro-rata basis using the time elapsed from inception of the agreement over the estimated duration of the development period under the agreement. If our costs for the quarter are less than those of Daiichi Sankyos, we report the amount due to Daiichi Sankyo as contra-revenue in that quarter. To the extent that our share of Phase 3 collaboration costs exceeds the amount of milestones and royalties received, that excess is netted against future milestones and royalties if and when earned and is not reported as contra-revenue. In 2011 our tivantinib collaboration costs incurred were less than those of Daiichi Sankyos by $166 million which was recognized as contra-revenue and netted against our tivantinib Daiichi Sankyo research and development revenue. Our non-refundable share of advance drug purchases in 2011 was $54 million. These costs are recognized as contra-revenue as the related drugs are administered to patients.For the year ended December 31, 2011 $29 million of these drug purchases was also recognized as contra-revenue. Our cumulative share of the Daiichi Sankyo Phase 3 costs inception to date through December 31, 2011, totaled $356 million and we received milestones of $250 million during that period. Our cumulative share of Phase 3 collaboration costs has exceeded the amount of milestones received through December 31, 2011 by $106 million which will be netted against future milestones and royalties when earned and has not been reported as contra-revenue. Prepaid expenses and other current assets include $25 million of prepaid Phase 3 drug purchases. This amount will be recognized as contra-revenue as the drugs are administered to patients in the Phase 3 trial.  62  In 2010, our tivantinib collaboration costs incurred were less than those of Daiichi Sankyos by $33million which was recognized as contra-revenue and netted against our tivantinib Daiichi Sankyo research and development revenue. There were no advance drug purchases in the year ended December 31, 2010. The duration and termination of the agreement are tied to future events. Unless earlier terminated due to breach, insolvency or upon 90days notice if prior to phase3 clinical trials or 180days notice if on or after the beginning of phase3 clinical trials by Daiichi Sankyo, the agreement shall continue until the later of isuch time as Daiichi Sankyo is no longer developing at least one licensed product or iiif Daiichi Sankyo has commercialized a licensed product or products, such time as all royalty terms for all licensed products have ended. The royalty term, on a country-by-country basis for a product, ends as of the later of ithe expiration of the last valid claim under a patent covering the manufacture, use, or sale of a licensed product or iia certain number of years from the date of the commercial sale of the licensed product in such country. Revenue for this agreement is recognized using the contingency-adjusted performance model with an estimated development period through December 2013. For the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010, $95million, net of $195 million of contra-revenue and $105million net of $33million of contra-revenue, respectively, were recognized as revenue.For the year ended December31, 2009, $139 million was recognized as revenue and there was no contra-revenue.At December31, 2011 and 2010, $370 millionand $410 million respectively, remained in deferred revenue. Kyowa Hakko Kirin Licensing Agreement On April27, 2007, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Kyowa Hakko Kirin to develop and commercialize tivantinib in Japan and parts of Asia. A $3million portion of an upfront licensing fee was received by the Company under this agreement in the first quarter of 2007, and an additional $27million in upfront licensing fees was received on May7, 2007. The agreement includes $123million in upfront and potential development milestone payments from Kyowa Hakko Kirin to ArQule, including the $30million cash upfront licensing payments. In February2008, we received a $3million milestone payment from Kyowa Hakko Kirin. Upon commercialization, ArQule will receive tiered royalties in the mid-teen to low-twenty percent range from Kyowa Hakko Kirin on net sales of tivantinib. Kyowa Hakko Kirin will be responsible for all clinical development costs and commercialization of the compound in certain Asian countries, consisting of Japan, China including Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan. In July2010, we announced the initiation of a Phase2 trial with tivantinib by Kyowa Hakko Kirin in gastric cancer, for which we received a $5million milestone payment in September2010.In August 2011, Kyowa Hakko Kirin announced the initiation of the Phase 3 ATTENTION trial in Asia of tivantinib and erlotinib in non-squamous NSCLC patients with wild type EGFR. Dosing of the first patient in this trial triggered a $10million milestone payment, which we received in August2011. The milestone payment was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized as revenue using the contingency-adjusted performance model with an estimated development period through April2016. In addition to the upfront and possible regulatory milestone payments totaling $123million, the Company will be eligible for future milestone payments based on the achievement of certain levels of net sales. The Company will recognize the payments, if any, as revenue in accordance with the contingency-adjusted performance model. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had not recognized any revenue from these sales milestone payments, and there can be no assurance that it will do so in the future. The duration and termination of the agreement are tied to future events. Unless earlier terminated due to breach, insolvency or upon 90days notice by Kyowa Hakko Kirin, the agreement terminates on the date that the last royalty term expires in all countries in the territory. The royalty term ends as of the later of ithe expiration of the last pending patent application or expiration of the patent in the country covering the manufacture, use, or sale of a licensed product or iia certain number of years from the date of the commercial launch in such country of such license product. Revenue for this agreement is recognized using the contingency-adjusted performance model with an estimated development period through April2016. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, $101 million, $61 million, and $40 million, respectively were recognized as revenue. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, $247millionand $240 million respectively, remained in deferred revenue. 4. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS We generally classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and re-evaluate such designation as of each consolidated balance sheet date. Since we generally intend to convert them into cash as necessary to meet our liquidity requirements our marketable securities are classified as cash equivalents if the original maturity, from the date of purchase, is ninety days or less and as short-term investments if the original maturity, from the date of purchase, is in excess of ninety days but less than one year. Our marketable securities are classified as long-term investments if the maturity date is in excess of one year of the balance sheet date.  63  We report available-for-sale investments at fair value as of each balance sheet date and include any unrealized gains and, to the extent deemed temporary, unrealized losses in stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are included in other income expense in the statement of operations. Our auction rate securities are classified as trading securities and any changes in the fair value of those securities are recorded as other income expense in the statement of operations. We conduct quarterly reviews to determine the fair value of our investment portfolio and to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to certain investments. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. In the event that the cost basis of a security exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, the duration of the period that, and extent to which, the fair value is less than cost basis, the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, and operational and financing cash flow factors, overall market conditions and trends, our intent to sell the investment and if it is more likely than not that we would be required to sell the investment before its anticipated recovery. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, we perform an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis. Where we intend to sell a security, or may be required to do so, the securitys decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as an impairment loss. Regardless of our intent to sell a security, we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security. Credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security. We invest our available cash primarily in U.S. Treasury bill funds, money market funds, commercial paper, and U.S. federal and state agency backed certificates, including auction rate securities that have investment grade ratings. Auction rate securities are structured with short-term interest reset dates of generally less than 90days, but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years. At the end of each reset period, which occurs every seven to twenty-eight days, investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par value. If auction rate securities fail an auction, due to sell orders exceeding buy orders, the funds associated with a failed auction would not be accessible until a successful auction occurred, a buyer was found outside the auction process, the underlying securities matured or a settlement with the underwriter is reached. ArQules marketable securities portfolio includes $21million at cost at December 31, 2011 and $26million at cost at December31, 2010, invested in auction rate securities. ArQules marketable securities portfolio included $595million at cost at December31, 2009, invested in auction rate securities. Beginning in the first quarter of 2008 and throughout 2010, certain auction rate securities failed at auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders. On November3, 2008, the Company received a put option from UBS AG to repurchase auction rate securities owned by the Company at par value at any time during the period from June30, 2010 through July2, 2012 the Put Option. The Company accounted for the Put Option as a freestanding financial instrument and elected to record the value under the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities. On June30, 2010, the company exercised the Put Option and in July 2010, UBS AG redeemed at par value all $229million of the Companys auction rate securities held by UBS AG that were outstanding at June30, 2010. Throughout 2010 UBS AG redeemed at par value a total of $569million of the Companys auction rate securities held by UBS AG, including those redeemed from the exercise of the Put Option. The Company used a portion of the $569million of 2010 redemptions to retire the $444million notes payable to UBS AG that had been outstanding at December31, 2009. The credit line at UBS AG was cancelled in July 2010.  64  The following is a summary of the fair value of available-for-sale marketable securities we held at December31, 2011 and December31, 2010 December31, 2011 Amortized

During the year ended December31, 2010, unrealized losses of $446 were recognized on the auction rate securities which were held as of December31, 2010. The underlying collateral of our auction rate securities consists of student loans, supported by the federal government as part of the Federal Family Education Loan Program FFELP. At December31, 2011, the Companys auction rate security is included in marketable securities-long term and totals $1,676. At December31, 2010, the Companys auction rate security is included in marketable securities-long term and totals $2,154. The net increase in value of our auction rate securities totaling $20 in the year ended December31, 2011 was recorded as a gain in other income in the statement of operations. The net decrease in value of our Put Option and auction rate securities totaling $712 in the year ended December31, 2010 was recorded as a loss in other income in the statement of operations.  65  In January 2010, we adopted a newly issued accounting standard which requires additional disclosure about the amounts of and reasons for significant transfers in and out of Level1 and Level2 fair value measurements. This standard also clarified existing disclosure requirements related to the level of disaggregation of fair value measurements for each class of assets and liabilities and requires disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring Level2 and Level3 measurements. In addition, effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December15, 2010, this standard further requires an entity to present disaggregated information about activity in Level3 fair value measurements on a gross basis, rather than as one net amount. As this newly issued accounting standard only requires enhanced disclosure, the adoption of this standard did not impact our financial position or results of operations and will not affect them in the future. The following tables present information about our assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods presented and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques we utilized to determine such fair value. In general, fair values determined by Level1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values determined by Level2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. We value our level2 investments using quoted prices for identical assets in the markets where they are traded, although such trades may not occur daily. These quoted prices are based on observable inputs, primarily interest rates. Fair values determined by Level3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. There were no transfers in or out of Level1 or Level2 measurements for the periods presented  December31 2011 Quoted Prices in

The model considers factors that reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing including, among others, the collateralization underlying the investments, the creditworthiness of the counterparty, the expected future cash flows, liquidity premiums, the probability of successful auctions in the future, and interest rates. The assumptions used are subject to volatility and may change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and markets conditions change.  66  Due to the lack of market quotes relating to our Put Option, the fair value measurements for our Put Option at December31, 2009 were estimated using a valuation approach commonly used for forward contracts in which one party agrees to sell a financial instrument generating cash flows to another party at a particular time for a predetermined price, which is based on Level3 inputs. In this approach the present value of all expected future cash flows is subtracted from the current fair value of the security, and the resulting value is calculated as a future value at an interest rate reflective of counterparty risk. On June30, 2010, the company exercised the Put Option and in July 2010, UBS AG redeemed at par value all $229million of the Companys auction rate securities held by UBS AG that were outstanding at June30, 2010. Throughout 2010 UBS AG redeemed at par value a total of $569million of the Companys auction rate securities held by UBS AG, including those redeemed from the exercise of the Put Option.

Simultaneous with that sale, we entered into an agreement to lease back the entire facility and the associated land. The lease was subsequently amended on June30, 2005. The amended lease has a term of ten years with an average annual rental rate of $3,409. We also have options to extend the lease term for up to an additional ten years. We are applying sale leaseback accounting to the transaction and are treating the lease as an operating lease. As a result of this transaction, we realized a gain on the sale of $5,477, which was deferred and is being amortized over the initial ten year lease term as a reduction in rent expense. The remaining amount of the deferred gain is $1,888 at December31, 2011.  67  6.

The amount outstanding under this facility was $17million at December31, 2011 and 2010 and was collateralized by $21million and $26 million of auction rate securities at cost, respectively. Interest expense was $25, $274 and $655 for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 9. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Preferred Stock We are authorized to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock. As of December31, 2011 and 2010, there were no outstanding shares of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors will determine the terms of the preferred stock if and when the shares are issued. Common Stock Our amended Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 100million shares of $001 par value common stock. In January 2011, we completed a stock offering in which we sold 8,050,000 shares of common stock at a price of $615 for net proceeds of $468million after commissions and offering expenses. At December31, 2011, we have 681,900 common shares reserved for future issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan Purchase Plan and for the exercise of common stock options pursuant to the 1994 Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan Equity Incentive Plan and the 1996 Amended and Restated Director Stock Option Plan Director Plan.  68  10. EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS During 2011, our stockholders approved an amendment to the Equity Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares available to 15,500,000. All shares are awarded at the discretion of our Board of Directors in a variety of stock based forms including stock options, restricted stock and performance based stock units. Pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan, incentive stock options may not be granted at less than the fair market value of our common stock at the date of the grant, and the option term may not exceed ten years. Stock options issued pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan generally vest over four years. For holders of 10% or more of our voting stock, options may not be granted at less than 110% of the fair market value of the common stock at the date of the grant, and the option term may not exceed five years. Stock appreciation rights granted in tandem with an option shall have an exercise price not less than the exercise price of the related option. As of December31, 2011, no stock appreciation rights have been issued. At December31, 2011, there were 4,387,745 shares available for future grant under the Equity Incentive Plan. During 2011, our stockholders approved an amendment to the Director Plan to increase the number of shares available to 950,500. Under the terms of the Director Plan, options to purchase shares of common stock are automatically granted Ato the Chairman of the Board of Directors 1upon his or her initial election or appointment in the amount of 25,000 and vesting over three years and 2upon his or her re-election or continuation on our board immediately after each annual meeting of stockholders in the amount of 25,000 and vesting immediately, and Bto each other Director 1upon his or her initial election to our board in the amount of 30,000 and vesting over three years and 2upon his or her re-election or continuation on our board in the amount of 15,000 and vesting immediately. All options granted pursuant to the Director Plan have a term of ten years with exercise prices equal to fair market value on the date of grant. Through December31, 2011, options to purchase 847,500 shares of common stock have been granted under this plan of which 641,000 shares are currently exercisable. As of December31, 2011, 276,000 shares are available for future grant. In 2009, we issued 12,000 fully-vested options to certain members of our Scientific Advisory Board under the Equity Incentive Plan. Compensation expense with respect to these awards was $41. No such awards were granted in 2010 or 2011. Option activity under the Plans for the years ended December31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 was as follows Stock Options Number of Shares Weighted Average

The weighted average remaining contractual life for options exercisable at December31, 2011 was 53years. In 2009, we granted 412,200 shares of restricted stock to employees, vesting annually over a four year period. In 2008 we granted 103,316 shares of restricted stock to employees, vesting annually over a four year period and 125,000 shares vesting annually over a two year period. The shares of restricted stock were issued at no cost to the recipients. The weighted average fair value of the restricted stock at the time of grant in 2009 and 2008 was $354 and $431 respectively, per share, and is being expensed ratably over the vesting period. Through December31, 2011, 60,945 shares have been forfeited, and 383,592 shares have vested. We recognized share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock of $358, $389 and $653 for the year ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

In July 2010, the Company amended its chief executive officers the CEOs employment agreement to grant the CEO 100,000 stock options, of which 25% vested upon grant and 25% vest annually over the next three years, and a maximum of 390,000 performance-based stock units that vest upon the achievement of certain performance and market based targets. Through December31, 2011 no expense has been recorded for these performance-based stock units. In February 2012, the Company amended its chief medical officer the CMO employment agreement to grant the CMO 50,000 performance-based stock units that vest upon the achievement of certain performance based targets.  70  In 1996, the stockholders adopted the Purchase Plan. This plan enables eligible employees to exercise rights to purchase our common stock at 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the date the right was granted or the date the right is exercised, whichever is lower. Rights to purchase shares under the Purchase Plan are granted by the Board of Directors. The rights are exercisable during a period determined by the Board of Directors; however, in no event will the period be longer than twenty-seven months. The Purchase Plan is available to substantially all employees, subject to certain limitations. In 2011, our stockholders approved an amendment to the Purchase Plan to increase the aggregate number of shares of the Companys common stock that may be to 2,400,000. As of December31, 2011, 1,718,100 shares have been purchased and 681,900 shares are available for future sale under the Purchase Plan. We recognized share-based compensation expense related to the Purchase Plan of $165, $248 and $215 for the year ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 11. INCOME TAXES There was no current or deferred tax expense for the year ended December31, 2011. The Company recorded a $550 federal income tax benefit in 2010 attributable to an election it made in the second quarter of 2010 under legislation that allowed net operating losses to offset 100% of alternative minimum tax AMT. Prior to this legislation, only 90% of AMT could be offset by net operating losses and accordingly in 2009 the Company recorded a $550 federal income tax expense for AMT. The Company received a refund in 2010 of the $550 AMT paid in 2009. The following is reconciliation between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009  2011 2010 2009 Income tax benefit expense at statutory rate 3,659 10,430 12,080 State tax benefit expense, net of Federal tax benefit expense 357 559 2,458 Permanent items 617 116 439 Effect of change in valuation allowance 3,737 11,586 17,089 Tax credits 2,006 1,466 2,632 Other 954 203 192 Tax expense benefit  550 550 The income tax effect of temporary differences comprising the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on the accompanying balance sheets is a result of the following at December31, 2011 and 2010  2011 2010 Deferred tax assets Net operating loss carryforwards 86,848 78,562 Tax credit carryforwards 22,492 20,486 Equity based compensation 5,881 5,115 Book depreciation in excess of tax 2,321 2,455 Reserves and accruals 101 69 Deferred revenue 21,439 28,559 Loss on investment 194 227 Other 180 182  139,254 135,517 Valuation allowance 139,254 135,517 Deferred tax liabilities   Net deferred tax assets   Total valuation allowance increased by $3,737 for the year ended December31, 2011. We have evaluated positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets, which are comprised principally of federal net operating loss NOL, net capital loss, and research and development credit carryforwards. We have determined that it is more likely than not that we will not recognize the benefits of our federal and state deferred tax assets and, as a result, we have established a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets as of December31, 2011. As of December31, 2011, we had federal NOL, state NOL, and research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $243,310, $171,060 and $25,063 respectively, which can be used to offset future federal and state income tax liabilities and expire at various dates through 2031. Federal net capital loss carryforwards of approximately $571 can be used to offset future federal capital gains and expire in 2015. Approximately $14,954 of our federal NOL and $1,974 of our state NOL were generated from excess tax deductions from share-based awards, the tax benefit of which will be credited to additional paid-in-capital when the deductions reduce current taxes payable.  71  At December31, 2010, and 2011 we had no unrecognized tax benefits. We do not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase in the next twelve months. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of December31, 2010 and 2011, we had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Our U.S. federal tax returns for the tax years 2009 through 2011 and our state tax returns for the tax years 2007 through 2011 remain open to examination. Prior tax years remain open to the extent of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Utilization of NOL and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation in the event of an ownership change that has occurred previously or could occur in the future pursuant to Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as well as similar state provisions. An ownership change may limit the amount of NOL and research and development credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, and may, in turn, result in the expiration of a portion of those carryforwards before utilization. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section382, results from transactions that increase the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50percentage points over a three year period. We undertook a detailed study of our NOL and research and development credit carryforwards in the fourth quarter of 2009 to determine whether such amounts are likely to be limited by Section382. As a result of this analysis, and a detailed review of ownership changes through 2011, we currently do not believe Sections382s limitations will significantly impact our ability to offset income with available NOL and research and development credit carryforwards. However, future ownership changes under Section382 may limit our ability to fully utilize these tax benefits. 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Leases We lease facilities under non-cancelable operating leases. At December31, 2011, the minimum lease commitments for all leased facilities, net of sublease income, are as follows YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31 OPERATING LEASES 2012 3,573 2013 3,073 2014 3,185 2015 1,069 2016 Thereafter  Total minimum lease payments 10,900 Rent expense under non-cancelable operating leases was approximately $2,866 for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. Sublease income, which is recorded as a reduction of rent expense, was approximately $0, $44, and $534, for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively. 13. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK Revenue from one customer represented approximately 79% of total revenue during 2011, 79% in 2010 and 84% in 2009. Revenue from another customer represented approximately 21% of total revenue during 2011, 21% in 2010, and 16% in 2009.  72  14. SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA UNAUDITED  FIRST

Item5.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Operating Officer Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2011. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2011, our Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Operating Officer Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f.

Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2011. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopersLLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.
