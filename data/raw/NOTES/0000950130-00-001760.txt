To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Stoneridge, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stoneridge,
Inc. an Ohio corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 and
the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Stoneridge, Inc. and
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.                            ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP Cleveland, Ohio,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise indicated
1. Organization and Nature of Business
Stoneridge, Inc. Stoneridge and its subsidiaries are independent
designers and manufacturers of engineered electrical and electronic components,
modules and systems for the automotive, medium and heavy-duty truck, and
agricultural vehicle markets.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Stoneridge and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries collectively,
the Company. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all short-term investments with original maturities
of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at
cost, which approximates fair value.
Accounts Receivable Concentrations
Revenues are principally generated from the automotive, medium and
heavy-duty truck, and agricultural vehicle markets. Due to the nature of these
industries, a significant portion of sales and related accounts receivable are
concentrated in a relatively low number of customers. In 1999, three customers
accounted for approximately 21%, 18% and 10% of net sales, while the top five
customers accounted for 69% of net sales. Three customers accounted for
approximately 25%, 18% and 10% of the Company 1998 net sales, and its top five
customers accounted for approximately 72% of its 1998 net sales. Accounts
receivable from the Company five largest customers aggregated approximately
$58,685 and $51,927 at December 31, 1999, and 1998, respectively.
Inventories
Cost is determined by the last-in, first-out LIFO method for
approximately 88% and 76% of the Company inventories at December 31, 1999 and
1998, respectively, and by the first-in, first-out FIFO method for all other
inventories. Inventory cost includes material, labor and overhead. Inventories
consist of the following at December 31                          1999        1998

$106,163     $ 94,770
Depreciation is provided by both the straight-line and accelerated methods
over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation expense for the
years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 was $17,057, $11,779 and $11,273,
respectively. Depreciable lives within each property classification are as
follows      Buildings and improvements        10-40 years
Machinery and equipment          5-10 years
Office furniture and fixtures       3-10 years
Tooling                  2-5 years
Vehicles                  3-5 years
Leasehold improvements           3-8 years
Maintenance and repair expenditures that are not considered betterments and
do not extend the useful life of property are charged to expense as incurred.
Expenditures for improvements and major renewals are capitalized. When assets
are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any gain or loss on the
disposition is credited or charged to income.
Goodwill and Other Intangibles
Goodwill and other intangibles, net, which result principally from
acquisitions, consist of the following at December 31                      Estimated

Goodwill and other intangibles are presented net of accumulated
amortization of $18,191 and $8,422 as of December 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. Goodwill and other intangible asset amortization expense totaled
approximately $9,769, $1,453 and $1,495 in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
The Company regularly evaluates its accounting for goodwill and other intangible
assets. Impairment would be recognized when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
Measurement of the amount of impairment would be based on appraisal, market
value of similar assets or estimated discounted future cash flows resulting from
the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.
Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consist of the following at
December 31                             1999       1998
Compensation-related obligations           $13,861     $14,717
Insurance-related obligations              7,441      7,241
Income taxes                      3,401      2,012

$47,114     $48,234
Income Taxes
Prior to the initial public offering Offering discussed in Note 3, the
Company was an S corporation. As an S corporation, the Company profits were
taxed directly to its shareholders for federal income tax and certain state
income tax purposes. Certain state taxes were paid directly by the Company.
Concurrent with the Offering, the Company terminated its S corporation status,
making it subject to federal, state and foreign income taxes.
The Company accounts for income taxes, using the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred
income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts.
Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such
benefits is more likely than not.
Currency Translation Adjustment
The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, where the local currency
is the functional currency, are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange
rates in effect at the period end for assets and liabilities and average
exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations.
Adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements are reflected as
accumulated other comprehensive income.
The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, where the U.S. dollar is
the functional currency and which have certain transactions denominated in a
local currency, are remeasured as if the functional currency were the U.S.
dollar. The remeasurement of local currencies into U.S. dollars creates
translation adjustments which are included in net income. All translation and
transaction activities were insignificant in 1999, 1998 and 1997.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenues from the sale of products at the point of
passage of title, which is generally at the time of shipment.

Product Development Expenses
Expenses associated with the development of new products and changes to
existing products are charged to expense as incurred. The costs amounted to
$21,976, $17,418 and $14,114 in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations in accounting for its employee share options. Since the exercise
price of the Company employee share options equals the market price of the
shares on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recorded. The Company
has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
Financial Instruments and Derivative Financial Instruments
Financial instruments held by the Company include cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, long-term debt and interest
rate swap agreements. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable and accounts payable is considered to be representative of fair value
because of the short maturity of these instruments. The fair values of
borrowings under the long-term debt facilities are based on rates available to
the Company for debt with comparable terms and maturities.
The interest rate swap agreements convert floating-rate debt under the
Company credit agreement to fixed-rate debt. As the outstanding balance on the
Company credit agreement was less than the notional amount of the interest
rate swap agreements, the market value attributable to the difference was
recognized in interest expense in 1998 and 1997.
Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
including certain self- insured risks and liabilities, and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Since actual results could differ from those estimates, the
Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes
available.
Net Income Per Share
Net income per share amounts for all periods are presented in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share,
which requires the presentation of basic net income per share and diluted net
income per share. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income
per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average of all
potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the period.
Potentially dilutive securities are not significant and do not create
differences between reported basic and diluted net income per share for all
periods presented.
Impairment of Assets
The Company reviews its long-lived assets and identifiable intangible
assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Measurement of the
amount of impairment may be based on appraisal, market values of similar assets
or estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate
disposition of the asset.

Comprehensive Income
During 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which established standards
for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components.
Comprehensive income is defined as all changes in a company net assets except
changes resulting from transactions with shareholders. Comprehensive income
differs from net income in that certain items currently recorded directly to
shareholders' equity are included in comprehensive income.
Accounting Standards
The Company is required to adopt Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133 SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. SFAS 133 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for
derivatives and hedging activities. This standard was effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 1999, with earlier adoption permitted. The Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB has since issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133. This
pronouncement amended SFAS 133 to defer its effective date to fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company has not yet evaluated the financial
accounting and reporting impact of SFAS 133.
The Company is required to adopt Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 99-5
EITF 99-5, Accounting for Pre-Production Costs Related to Long-Term Supply
Arrangements, for its fiscal year ending 2000. EITF 99-5 establishes new
accounting rules for costs related to the design and development of products and
for costs incurred to develop molds, dies and other tools to be used to produce
products that will be sold under long-term supply agreements. The Company
believes that the adoption of EITF 99-5 could have a material impact on its
financial statements. Upon adoption, the Company will be required to expense as
incurred certain costs that were previously capitalized. Management is currently
assessing the specifics of EITF 99-5 and will incorporate the EITF 99- 5
accounting rules in the Company consolidated financial statements for the
quarter ended March 31, 2000.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to their 1999
presentation in the financial statements. 3. Offering of Common Shares
On October 10, 1997, the Company completed its Offering of 6,727,500 Common
Shares, resulting in net proceeds of $108,693. Net proceeds from the Offering
were used to pay an $83,000 S corporation distribution, and the remaining
proceeds were used to repay net borrowings under the credit agreement discussed
in Note 6. Concurrent with the Offering, certain officers and management of the
Company purchased 510,181 Common Shares Management Reinvestment, resulting in
net proceeds of $8,326.
In connection with the Offering, the Company amended its Articles of
Incorporation to change the authorized share capital of the Company from 37,724
shares of Class A Common, voting, without par value, and 87,276 shares of Class
B Common, non-voting, without par value, to 60,000,000 Common Shares, without
par value and 5,000,000 shares of voting Preferred Shares, without par value.
The amended Articles of Incorporation provided that each Class A Common Share
and Class B Common Share automatically became 1390856 Common Shares. All
applicable share and per share data have been adjusted accordingly in these
financial statements.

In April 1996, the Company purchased 45% of the outstanding common stock of
Berifors AB Berifors, a Sweden-based manufacturer of electronic
instrumentation and information displays for the European truck and commercial
vehicle markets, for approximately $8,834. The investment was accounted for
under the equity method of accounting. The excess of the amount paid over the
fair value of the assets acquired, totaling $7,200, is being amortized over 40
years on a straight-line basis. On October 10, 1997, the Company acquired the
remaining 55% of Berifors, in exchange for 757,063 Common Shares. The
transaction was accounted for as a purchase. The excess of the purchase price
over the fair value of assets acquired, totaling $10,439, is being amortized
over 40 years on a straight-line basis. The results of operations of Berifors
are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements from October 1997.
5. Investments
In October 1997, the Company purchased 50% of the outstanding common stock
of PST Industria Eletronica da Amazonia Ltda. PST, a Brazilian electronic
components business that specializes in electronic vehicle security devices. The
investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Total cash
consideration paid by the Company with respect to this investment was $17,722,
including fees and expenses. The allocation of purchase price resulted in
intangibles, primarily non-compete agreements and goodwill of $2,000 and
$12,622, respectively, which are being amortized over periods of two and 40
years, respectively. Amortization expense was $1,024, $1,190 and $469 in 1999,
1998 and 1997, respectively. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under
the credit agreement discussed in Note 6. In 1998, the Company loaned PST
$5,000, which was used for the repayment of existing debt. The note is secured
by certain assets of PST.
In August 1997, the Company entered into two joint venture agreements with
Connecto AB, a Swedish manufacturer of power distribution systems. Pursuant to
the terms of the agreements, the Company has a 60% interest in a Brazilian joint
venture and a 40% interest in a European joint venture. The Brazilian joint
venture is consolidated with the results of the Company and the European joint
venture is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. As of December
31, 1999, the Company incurred costs of approximately $1,041 related to these
joint ventures. The joint ventures are establishing production facilities in
Brazil and Europe for the purpose of manufacturing and selling power
distribution systems in South America and Europe, respectively. The Company
finances its investments in the joint ventures through borrowings under the
credit agreement discussed in Note 6.
6. Long-Term Debt
The Company has a $425,000 credit agreement with a bank group. The credit
agreement has three components: a $100,000 revolving credit facility, a $150,000
term facility and a $175,000 term facility. The $100,000 revolving facility and
the $150,000 term facility expire on December 31, 2003 and require a commitment
fee of 037% to 050% on the unused balance. Interest is payable quarterly at
either i the prime rate plus a margin of 000% to 100% or ii LIBOR plus a
margin of 125% to 250%, depending upon the Company ratio of consolidated
total debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization EBITDA, as defined. The $175,000 term facility expires on
December 31, 2005. Interest is payable quarterly at either i the prime rate
plus a margin of 200% or ii LIBOR plus a margin of 350%.
The weighted average interest rate in effect for the years ended December
31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 was approximately 84%, 71% and 71%, respectively,
including the effects of the interest rate swap agreements.

Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries are $7,713 as of December 31,
1999. Because these earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in foreign
operations, no provision has been made for U.S. income taxes. It is
impracticable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred taxes with
respect to these earnings; however, foreign tax credits would be available to
reduce U.S. income taxes in the event of a distribution.
As a result of the Company conversion to C corporation status on October
9, 1997, current deferred income tax assets and noncurrent deferred income tax
liabilities of approximately $4,073 and $2,906, respectively, were recorded,
offsetting a cumulative effect benefit of $1,167.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following at December
31                            1999     1998

8.  Operating Lease Commitments
The Company leases equipment, vehicles and buildings from third parties
under operating lease agreements.
The Company also leases some of its facilities from certain related
parties. The leases are accounted for as operating leases and are for various
terms with additional renewal options. The Company is generally responsible for
repairs and maintenance, taxes and insurance.
For the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, lease expense totaled
$3,620, $3,015 and $2,313, under these agreements including related party lease
expense of $465, $451 and $451, respectively.

9. Share Option Plans
In June 1996, the Company granted 438,119 options to directors and key
executives to purchase Common Shares at $574 per share. The options were
exercised prior to the Offering. The Company recorded compensation expense of
$450 in 1997 relative to these options.
In October 1997, the Company adopted a Long-Term Incentive Plan Incentive
Plan. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 Common Shares for issuance under the
Incentive Plan. Under the Incentive Plan, the Company has granted cumulative
options to purchase 601,000 Common Shares to management with exercise prices
equal to the fair market value of the Company Common Shares at the date of
grant. The options vest from one to five years after the date of grant.

Of the outstanding options issued and outstanding under the Incentive Plan,
484,000 are currently exercisable as of December 31, 1999.
The following pro forma information regarding net income and net income per
share is required by SFAS 123, and has been determined as if the Company had
accounted for its share options under the fair value method of that Statement.
The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions                          1999        1998
Risk-free interest rate        529-532%    597-616%
Expected dividend yield         000%       000%
Expected lives           75 - 85 years   75 years
Expected volatility           3390%      3319   The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected share price
volatility. Because the Company share options have characteristics
significantly different from traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its share options.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The Company
pro forma net earnings per share were as follows                                       1999      1998      1997

Basic and diluted net income per share - pro forma          $ 175    $ 139    $ 289 10.  Employee Benefit Plans
The Company has certain defined contribution profit sharing and 401k
plans covering substantially all of the employees. Company contributions are
generally discretionary; however, a portion of these contributions are based
upon a percentage of employee compensation, as defined in the plans. The
Company policy is to fund all benefit costs accrued. There are no unfunded
prior service costs. For the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
contributions amounted to $6,310, $3,149 and $3,274, respectively.
The Company does not provide any other material retirement,
postretirement or postemployment benefits to its employees.
11. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
A financial instrument is cash or a contract that imposes an obligation
to deliver, or conveys a right to receive cash or another financial instrument.
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
accounts payable are considered to be representative of fair value because of
the short maturity of these instruments. In management opinion, the estimated
fair value of the Company long-term debt approximates book value, as under the
terms of the borrowing arrangements, a significant portion of the obligations
are subject to fluctuating market rates of interest.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposures to
market risks resulting from fluctuations in interest rates. The Company does not
enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. Management believes that
its use of these instruments to reduce risk is in the Company best interest.
Derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 1999, and 1998,
include the following interest rate swap agreements                     Expected
Notional Amount     Fixed Rate      Maturity
1999     1998      Paid         Date
--     25,000    655-780     Feb. 01, 1999
--     20,000    703-928     Aug 01, 1999
63,425    75,000    650-775     Dec. 29, 2000
63,425    75,000    650-775     Dec. 29, 2000
86,625    87,500       815     Dec. 31, 2000
86,625    87,500       815     Dec. 31, 2000
The fair market value of these interest rate swap agreements, which was
estimated based on quoted market sources, approximated a net asset of $4,025 and
a net liability of $220, at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
32            STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise indicated
The interest rate swap agreements require the Company to pay a fixed
interest rate to counterparties while receiving a floating interest rate based
on LIBOR. The fixed rate paid to the counterparties is dependent on the
Company ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA as defined by
the Company $425,000 credit agreement discussed in Note 6. The counterparties
to each of the interest rate swap agreements are major commercial banks.
Management believes that losses related to credit risk are remote.
12. Unaudited Pro Forma Information
The unaudited pro forma net income in the consolidated statement of
income for the year ended December 31, 1997, assumes that the Company was
subject to income taxes as a C corporation.
Unaudited pro forma net income per share for the year ended December 31,
1997, has been calculated by dividing pro forma net income by the weighted
average number of Common Shares outstanding, the number of Common Shares issued
in connection with the Offering discussed in Note 3 6,727,500, the number of
Common Shares issued in connection with the exercise of share options as
discussed in Note 9 438,119, and the number of Common Shares issued in
connection with the Management Reinvestment discussed in Note 3 510,181.
13. Commitments and Contingencies
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in various
legal proceedings, workers' compensation and product liability disputes. The
Company is of the opinion that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not
have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial
position of the Company.
14. Geographic Areas
Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 131 SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS 131 requires the financial statement
disclosures for operating segments, products and services, and geographic areas.
The Company operates in one business segment based on the criteria set forth in
SFAS 131.
