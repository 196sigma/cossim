Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management evaluated, with the participation and under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
In accordance with guidance issued by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal controls over financial reporting during the year of the acquisition while integrating the acquired operations. Managements evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excludes the operations of the six dealerships acquired in 2015. These stores represent approximately 3% of consolidated total assets and less than 1% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Based on our assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
KPMG LLP, our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, which is included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
