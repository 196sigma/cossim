Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Board of Directors and Stockholders   IXYS Corporation   Milpitas, California   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
IXYSCorporation as of March31, 2008 and 2007 and the
related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity, comprehensive income loss, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
March31, 2008. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of IXYSCorporation as of March31, 2008 and
2007, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended March31, 2008,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.   As more fully described in Note11 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, effective April1, 2007, the Company
changed its method of accounting for uncertain tax positions to
conform to FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States,
IXYSCorporations internal control over financial
reporting as of March31, 2008, based on criteria

Formation
and Business of IXYS   IXYSCorporation IXYS or the
Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets
power semiconductors and digital and analog integrated circuits
ICs. Power semiconductors are used primarily in
controlling energy in motor drives, power conversion including
uninterruptible power supplies UPS and switch mode
power supplies SMPS, and medical electronics.
IXYSs power semiconductors convert electricity at
relatively high voltage and current levels to create efficient
power as required by a specific application. IXYSs target
market includes segments of the power semiconductor market that
require medium to high power semiconductors, with a particular
emphasis on high power semiconductors. IXYSs power
semiconductors include power metal oxide silicon field effect
transistors Power MOSFETs, insulated gate bipolar
transistors IGBTs, thyristors and rectifiers,
including fast recovery epitaxial diodes FREDs.
IXYSs ICs include solid-state relays SSRs
for telecommunications applications and power management and
control ICs, such as current regulators, motion controllers,
digital power modulators and drivers.   IXYS sells products in North America, Europe and Asia through an
organization that includes direct sales personnel, independent
representatives and distributors. The Company is headquartered
in Northern California with principal operations in California,
Massachusetts, Germany and the United Kingdom. Each site has
manufacturing, research and development and sales and
distribution activities. The Company also makes use of
subcontract manufacturers for fabrication of wafers and for
assembly and test operations.

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   Principles
of Consolidation   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
IXYS and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of all
intercompany balances and transactions.   Foreign
Currency Translation   The local currency is considered to be the functional currency
of IXYSs wholly owned international subsidiaries: the euro
for IXYS Semiconductor GmbH IXYS GmbH; and the
pound sterling for Westcode Semiconductors Limited
Westcode. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are
translated at the exchange rate in effect at year-end and
revenues and expenses are translated at average rates during the
year. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the accounts
of IXYS GmbH and Westcode into U.S.dollars are included in
accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of
stockholders equity. The Companys Swiss subsidiary
utilizes the US dollar as its functional currency. Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are included as a
component of other income or expense.   Use of
Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could materially differ from IXYSs
estimates.   Revenue
Recognition   IXYS complies with the guidance summarized in Staff Accounting
Bulletin SAB No104, Revenue
Recognition.   Revenues are recognized upon shipment, provided that a signed
purchase order has been received, the price is fixed, title has
transferred, collection of resulting receivables is reasonably
assured, and there are no remaining significant obligations.
Reserves for sales returns and allowances, including allowances
for so called ship and   
51 Table of Contents   IXYS
CORPORATION
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   debit transactions, are recorded at the time of shipment,
based on historical levels of returns and discounts, current
economic trends and changes in customer demand. Transactions
with sale terms of FOB shipping point are recognized when the
products are shipped and transactions with sale terms of FOB
destination are recognized upon arrival.   IXYS sells to distributors and original equipment manufacturers.
Approximately 483% of the Companys revenues in fiscal
2008 were from distributors. IXYS provides its distributors with
the following programs: stock rotation and ship and debit. Ship
and debit is a form of price protection. IXYS recognizes revenue
from product sales upon shipment provided that it has received
an executed purchase order, the price is fixed and determinable,
the risk of loss has transferred, collection of resulting
receivables is reasonably assured, there are no customer
acceptance requirements, and there are no remaining significant
obligations. Reserves for allowances are also recorded at the
time of shipment. The management of IXYS must make estimates of
potential future product returns and so called ship and
debit transactions related to current period product
revenue. Management analyzes historical returns and ship and
debit transactions, current economic trends and changes in
customer demand and acceptance of the Companys products
when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and
allowances. We have visibility into inventory held by our
distributors to aid in our reserve analysis. Significant
management judgments and estimates must be made and used in
connection with establishing the allowances in any accounting
period. Material differences may result in the amount and timing
of the Companys revenue for any period if management made
different judgments or utilized different estimates.   Accounts receivable from distributors are recognized and
inventory is relieved when title to inventories transfer,
typically upon shipment from IXYS, at which point we have a
legally enforceable right to collection under normal payment
terms. Under certain circumstances where the Company is not able
to reasonably and reliably estimate the actual returns, revenues
and costs relating to distributor sales are deferred until
products are sold by the distributors to the distributors
end customers. Deferred amounts are presented net and included
under Accrued expenses and other liabilities.   Allowance for sales returns.IXYS maintains an
allowance for sales returns for estimated product returns by its
customers. The Company estimates its allowance for sales returns
based on its historical return experience, current economic
trends, changes in customer demand, known returns it has not
received and other assumptions. If IXYS were to make different
judgments or utilize different estimates, the amount and timing
of its revenue could be materially different. Given that the
Companys revenues consist of a high volume of relatively
similar products, to date its actual returns and allowances have
not fluctuated significantly from period to period, and its
returns provisions have historically been reasonably accurate.
This allowance is included as part of the accounts receivable
allowance on the balance sheet and as a reduction of revenues in
the statement of operations.   Allowance for stock rotation.The Company also
provides stock rotation to select distributors. The
rotation allows distributors to return a percentage of the
previous six months sales. In the fiscal years ended
March31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, approximately
$10million, $18million and $962,000, respectively,
of products were returned to IXYS under the program. IXYS
generally establishes the stock rotation on all sales to
distributors except where the revenue recognition is deferred
and recognized on the sale by the distributor of products to the
end-customers. The allowance, which is managements best
estimate of future returns, is based upon the historical
experience of returns and inventory levels at the distributors.
This allowance is included as part of the accounts receivable
allowance on the balance sheet and as a reduction of revenues in
the statement of operations.   Allowance for ship and debit.Ship and debit
is a program designed to assist distributors in meeting
competitive prices in the marketplace on sales to their end
customers. Ship and debit requires a request from the
distributor for a pricing adjustment for a specific part for a
customer sale to be shipped from the distributors stock.
The Company has no obligation to accept this request. However,
it is the Companys historical practice to allow some
companies to obtain pricing adjustments for inventory held.
IXYSs distributors had approximately $52million in
inventory of the Companys products on hand at
March31, 2008. Ship and debit authorizations may cover
current and future distributor activity for a specific part for
sale to the distributors customer. At the time   
52 Table of Contents   IXYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   the Company records sales to the distributors, it provides an
allowance for the estimated future distributor activity related
to such sales since it is probable that such sales to
distributors will result in ship and debit activity. The sales
allowance requirement is based on sales during the period,
credits issued to distributors, distributor inventory levels,
historical trends, market conditions, pricing trends IXYS sees
in its direct sales activity with original equipment
manufacturers and other customers, and input from sales,
marketing and other key management. The Company receives
periodic statements regarding its products held by distributors.
These procedures require the exercise of significant judgments.
IXYS believes that they enable the Company to make reliable
estimates of future credits under the ship and debit program.
Actual results to date have approximated the estimates. At the
time the distributor ships the part from stock, the distributor
debits IXYS for the authorized pricing adjustment. This
allowance is included as part of the accounts receivable
allowance on the balance sheet and as a reduction of revenues in
the statement of operations. If competitive pricing were to
decrease sharply and unexpectedly, estimates would be
insufficient, which could significantly adversely affect results.   Additions to the ship and debit allowance are estimates of the
amount of expected future ship and debit activity related to
sales during the period and reduce revenues and gross profit in
the period. The following table sets forth the beginning and
ending balances of, additions to, and deductions from, the
allowance for ship and debit during the three years ended

customers that are required to be remitted to the various
government agencies. The amount of taxes collected from
customers and payable to government is included under accrued
expenses and other liabilities. Shipping and handling costs are
included in cost of sales.   Trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful
accounts.Trade accounts receivable are recorded
at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance
for doubtful accounts is IXYSs best estimate of the amount
of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable.
IXYS determines the allowance based on the aging of its accounts
receivable, the financial condition of its customers and their
payment history, its historical write-off experience and other
assumptions. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed
quarterly. Past due balances and other specified accounts as
necessary are reviewed individually. Account balances are
charged off against the allowance after all means of collection
have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered

STATEMENTSContinued   remote. This allowance is included as part of the accounts
receivable allowance on the balance sheet and as a selling,
general and administrative expense in the statement of
operations.   Cash
and Cash Equivalents   IXYS considers all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be
cash equivalents. Cash equivalents include investments in
commercial paper and money market accounts at banks.   Restricted
Cash   Cash and cash equivalents at March31, 2008 and
March31, 2007 include restricted cash balances of $620,000
and $169,000, respectively. The restricted cash balances include
amounts pledged as collateral on outstanding letters of credit
and funds held in escrow.   Inventories   Inventories, consisting primarily of wafers, bipolar devices,
transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, are recorded at the
lower of a currently adjusted standard cost, which approximates
actual cost on a
first-in-first-out
basis, or market value. The Companys accounting for
inventory costing is based on the applicable expenditure
incurred, directly or indirectly, in bringing the inventory to
its existing condition. Such expenditures include acquisition
costs, production costs and other costs incurred to bring the
inventory to its use. As it is impractical to track inventory
from the time of purchase to the time of sale for the purpose of
specifically identifying inventory cost, inventory is therefore
valued based on a standard cost, given that the materials
purchased are identical and interchangeable at various
production processes. The Company follows
SFASNo151, Inventory Costs an
amendment of ARB No43, Chapter4.
SFASNo151 requires certain abnormal expenditures to
be recognized as expenses in the current period versus being
capitalized in inventory. It also requires that the amount of
fixed production overhead allocated to inventory be based on the
normal capacity of the production facilities. The application of
SFASNo151 did not have a material impact on the
Companys consolidated financial statements. IXYS reviews
its standard costs on an as-needed basis but in any event at
least once a year, and updates them as appropriate to
approximate actual costs.   The Company typically plans its production and inventory levels
based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which are highly
unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. The value of its
inventories is dependent on its estimate of future demand as it
relates to historical sales. If the Companys projected
demand is over-estimated, IXYS may be required to reduce the
valuation of its inventories below cost. IXYS regularly reviews
inventory quantities on hand and records an estimated provision
for excess inventory based primarily on its historical sales and
expectations for future use. However, for new products, the
Company does not consider whether there is excess inventory
until it develops sufficient sales history or experiences a
significant change in expected product demand, based on backlog.
Actual demand and market conditions may be different from those
projected by IXYSs management. This could have a material
effect on the Companys operating results and financial
position. If IXYS were to make different judgments or utilize
different estimates, the amount and timing of the write-down of
inventories could be materially different.   Excess inventory frequently remains saleable. When excess
inventory is sold, it yields a gross profit margin of up to
100%. Sales of excess inventory have the effect of increasing
the gross profit margin beyond that which would otherwise occur,
because of previous write-downs. Once inventory is written down
below cost, it is not written back up until inventory is
subsequently sold or scrapped. IXYS does not physically
segregate excess inventory and assign unique tracking numbers to
it in the Companys accounting systems. Consequently, IXYS
cannot isolate the sales prices of excess inventory from the
sales prices of non-excess inventory. Therefore, IXYS is unable
to report the amount of gross profit resulting from the sale of
excess inventory or quantify the favorable impact of such gross
profit on its gross profit margin.

manufacture of semiconductor wafers in minimum lot sizes. Often,
when manufactured, the Company does not know whether or when all
the semiconductors resulting from a lot of wafers will sell.
With more than 9,000 different part numbers for semiconductors,
excess inventory resulting from the manufacture of some of those
semiconductors will be continual and ordinary. Because the cost
of storage is minimal when compared to potential value and
because the products of the Company do not quickly become
obsolete, IXYS expects to hold excess inventory for potential
future sale for years. Consequently, IXYS has no set time line
for the sale or scrapping of excess inventory.   In addition, the inventory of the Company is also being written
down to lower of cost or market or net realizable value. IXYS
reviews its inventory listing on a quarterly basis for an
indication of losses being sustained for costs that exceed
selling prices less direct costs to sell. When it is evident
that the selling price is lower than current cost, the inventory
is marked down accordingly. At March31, 2008 and 2007, the
Companys lower of cost or market reserve was
$10million and $615,000, respectively.   The Company periodically identifies any inventory that is no
longer usable and writes it off against recorded reserves.   The Company has entered into purchase agreements for purchase of
wafers and substrates over one to five years. Under these
agreements, the supplier agrees to supply and the Company is
obliged to purchase products corresponding to an agreed yearly
purchase amount. The Company has recognized the liability for
all products delivered as at March31, 2008. The total
amount committed under the agreements has been disclosed in
Note6, Commitments and Contingencies.   Property,
Plant and Equipment   Property, plant and equipment, including equipment under capital
leases, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Equipment under capital lease is stated at the lower of the
present value of the minimum lease payments at the beginning of
the lease term or the fair value of the leased assets at the
inception of the lease.   
55 Table of Contents   IXYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over
estimated useful lives of 2 to 14years for equipment and
24years to 50years for property and plant. Upon
disposal, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are
removed from IXYSs accounts and the resulting gains or
losses are reflected in the statements of operations. Repairs
and maintenance costs are charged to expense. Depreciation of
leasehold improvements is provided on the straight-line method
over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the
lease.   As required by SFASNo144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, IXYS
evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its
property, plant and equipment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be fully recoverable. Impairment is assessed when the
forecasted undiscounted cash flows derived for the operation to
which the assets relate are less than the carrying amount
including associated intangible assets of the operation. If the
operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying
amount of its assets, then intangible assets are written down
first, followed by the other long-lived assets of the operation,
to fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash
flows or appraised values, depending on the nature of the
assets. Judgment is used when applying these impairment rules to
determine the timing of the impairment test, the undiscounted
expected cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair
value of an impaired asset. The dynamic economic environment in
which IXYS operates and the resulting assumptions used to
estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of these
impairment tests.   On June10, 2005, IXYS Semiconductor GmbH, a German
subsidiary of IXYS, borrowed 100million, or about
$122million at the time, from IKB Deutsche Industriebank
for a term of 15years. This loan is partially
collateralized by a security interest in the facility owned by
IXYS in Lampertheim, Germany. See Note5, Borrowing
Arrangements for more details.   On August2, 2007, IXYS Buckeye, LLC, a subsidiary of IXYS,
acquired real property in Milpitas, California for
$75million. The Company moved its corporate office and a
facility for operations to this location in January 2008.
Additional costs of $101,000 incurred in connection with
preparing the building for occupancy were capitalized. The
building is being depreciated over its estimated useful life of
40years. The property was acquired by assumption of a loan
in the principal amount of $75million. For further
details regarding the loan, see Note5.   Treasury
Stock   The Company accounts for treasury stock using the cost method.   Other
Assets   Other assets include marketable equity securities classified as
available-for-sale and long term equity investment accounted
under the equity method. In accordance with
SFASNo115, Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities, unrealized gains and losses
on these investments are included as a separate component of
stockholders equity. Realized gains calculated as
proceeds less specifically identified costs and losses and
declines in value of these investments judged by management to
be other than temporary, if any, are included in interest income
and expense. The Company has a 45% equity interest in Powersem
GmbH Powersem, a semiconductor manufacturer based
in Germany, and 20% equity interest in EB Tech Ltd
EBTech, a radiation services provider based
in South Korea. These investments are accounted for using the
equity method. The Company recognized income of $507,000 and
loss of $176,000 during fiscal 2008 on each of these
investments, respectively. In fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, the
Company recognized income of $433,000 and $510,000,
respectively. See Note4, Balance Sheet Details
for further information.   An impairment loss is recorded when there has been a loss in
value of the investment that is other than temporary.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Goodwill
and Intangible Assets   Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the
estimated fair value of the net assets acquired. IXYS values
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with
SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. The costs of acquired intangible assets are
recorded at fair value at acquisition. Intangible assets with
finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over
their estimated useful lives, normally three to six years, and
evaluated for impairment in accordance with
SFASNo144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.   Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are carried
at fair value and reviewed at least annually for impairment
during the quarter ending March31, as of December31,
or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the
asset might be impaired, in accordance with
SFASNo142. An impairment loss would be recognized
to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of
the reporting unit. There are two steps in the determination.
The first step compares the carrying amount of the net assets to
the fair value of the reporting unit. The second step, if
necessary, recognizes an impairment loss to the extent the
carrying amount of the reporting units net assets exceed
the fair value of the reporting unit. The implied fair value of
goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the
reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price
allocation, in accordance with SFASNo141,
Business Combinations. The residual fair value after
this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting
units goodwill. IXYS has not recorded an impairment of
goodwill or intangible assets.   In fiscal 2008, the Company reduced goodwill by $816,000. In
fiscal 2007, the Company reduced goodwill by $10million.
In fiscal 2006, the Company reduced goodwill and intangible
assets by $14million and $13million, respectively.
The reductions in goodwill resulted from valuation allowance
releases on deferred tax assets, accounted for in accordance
with SFASNo109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. This is discussed in Note11, Income
Taxes below. These deferred tax assets were from loss
carryforwards of acquired entities. At March31, 2008, the
Company had goodwill of $56million and intangible assets
of $466,000 included in other assets.   Foreign
Exchange Contracts   Although the majority of IXYSs transactions are in
U.S.dollars, IXYS enters into foreign exchange forward and
option contracts to manage foreign currency exchange risk
associated with its operations. From time to time, IXYS
purchases short-term, foreign exchange forward and option
contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations
on certain underlying assets, liabilities and commitments for
operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies. The
purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the results of
operations. The contracts generally have maturity dates that do
not exceed six months. IXYS does not purchase these contracts
for trading purposes. The Company elected not to designate these
contracts as accounting hedges and any changes in fair value are
marked to market and recorded in the results of operations in
other income. IXYS did not have any significant open foreign
exchange forward and option contracts during the year ended
March31, 2008.   Defined
Benefit Plans   IXYS maintains pension plans covering certain of its employees.
For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension costs are
calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions,
including a discount rate for plan obligations, assumed rate of
return on pension plan assets and assumed rate of compensation
increases for plan employees. All of these assumptions are based
upon managements judgment, considering all known trends
and uncertainties. Actual results that differ from these
assumptions would impact the future expense recognition and cash
funding requirements of the Companys pension plans.
Effective at the end of fiscal 2007, IXYS adopted the provisions
of SFASNo158, Employers Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Retirement Plans.
SFASNo158 required IXYS to recognize the funded
status of its defined benefit pension and post-retirement
benefit plans in its Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a
corresponding adjustment to accumulated other

STATEMENTSContinued   comprehensive income, net of tax. The adoption of
SFASNo158 did not have any impact on the
consolidated financial statements. See Note10,
Pension Plans for the effects of the adoption of
SFASNo158.   Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   Carrying amounts of certain of IXYSs financial instruments
including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short
maturities. Based on borrowing rates currently available to IXYS
for loans with similar terms, the carrying value of notes
payable to banks, loans payable and notes receivable from
stockholders approximate fair value.   Advertising   IXYS expenses advertising as the costs are incurred. Advertising
expense for the years ended March31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
was $518,000, $628,000 and $603,000, respectively. Advertising
expense is included in selling, general and administrative
expense.   Research
and Development   Research and development costs are charged to operations as
incurred.   Income
Taxes   IXYSs provision for income taxes is comprised of its
current tax liability and the change in deferred tax assets and
liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases
of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax
rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are
expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is required to reduce
the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than
not to be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation
allowance, IXYS considers estimated future taxable income as
well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing
jurisdiction in which it operates. If IXYS determines that it is
more probable that it will not realize all or a portion of its
remaining deferred tax assets, it will increase its valuation
allowance with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if
IXYS determines that it is likely that it will ultimately be
able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for
which a valuation allowance has been provided, the related
portion of the valuation allowance will be released as either a
credit to goodwill, non-current intangible assets, or income tax
expense. Significant management judgment is required in
determining the provision for income taxes, the deferred tax
assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded
against net deferred tax assets. In the event that actual
results differ from these estimates or IXYS adjusts these
estimates in future periods, IXYS may need to establish or
increase an additional valuation allowance that could materially
impact its financial position and results of operations.
IXYSs ability to utilize its deferred tax assets and the
continuing need for a related valuation allowance are monitored
on an ongoing basis.   IXYS adopted FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of
FASB Statement No109 FIN48, and
related guidance as of April1, 2007. See Note11 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion.   Other
Income and Expense   Other income and expense primarily consists of gains and losses
on foreign currency transactions and interest income and
expense, together with the Companys share of income from
investments accounted for on the equity method.   Indemnification   The Company does not provide product guarantees or warranties.
On occasion, the Company provides limited indemnification to
customers against intellectual property infringement claims
related to the Companys products.   
58 Table of Contents   IXYS
CORPORATION
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   To date, the Company has not experienced significant activity or
claims related to such indemnifications. The Company also
provides in the normal course of business indemnification to its
officers, directors and selected parties. The Company is unable
to estimate any potential future liability, if any; therefore,
no liability for these indemnification agreements has been
recorded as of March31, 2008 and 2007.   Legal
Contingencies   IXYS is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the
outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty.
SFASNo5, Accounting for Contingencies,
requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should
be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset
has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a
contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable
possibility that a loss has been incurred. IXYS evaluates, among
other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable
outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the
amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact
the Companys financial position, results of operations or
cash flows. At March31, 2008, IXYS did not have any
reserves for litigation upon the favorable fiscal 2008 decisions
of the appellate courts in the matters involving International
Rectifier Corporation and LoJack Corporation. At March31,
2007, IXYS had reserves of approximately $142million for
litigation, comprised of reserves for the litigation against
International Rectifier Corporation of $68million and
against LoJack Corporation of $74million. The Company
expenses legal costs related to loss contingencies as incurred.   Net
Income Loss per Share   Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income
loss by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects
the potential dilution from the exercise of options into common
stock. The calculation of dilutive net income loss per share
excludes potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive; that
is, when the exercise price of the option exceeds the market
price. Potential shares consist of incremental common shares
issuable upon the exercise of stock options.   Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income   Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss represents
foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gain or
loss on equity investments classified as available for
sale and minimum pension liability, net of tax. See
Note7, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.   Concentration
and Business Risks   Dependence
on Third Parties for Wafer Fabrication and Assembly   Measured in dollars, IXYS manufactures approximately 62% of its
wafers, an integral component of its products, in its facilities
in Germany, the UK, Massachusetts and California. IXYS relies on
third party suppliers to provide the remaining 38%. The
principal external foundry is Samsung Electronics facility
in Kiheung, SouthKorea. There can be no assurance that
material disruptions in supply will not occur in the future. In
such event, IXYS may have to identify and secure additional
foundry capacity and may be unable to identify or secure
sufficient foundry capacity to meet demand. Even if such
capacity is available from another manufacturer, the
qualification process could take six months or longer. If IXYS
were unable to qualify alternative manufacturing sources for
existing or new products in a timely manner or if such sources
were unable to produce semiconductor devices with acceptable
manufacturing yields and at acceptable prices, IXYSs
business, financial condition and results of operations would be
materially and adversely affected.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Dependence
on Suppliers   IXYS purchases silicon substrates from a limited number of
vendors, most of whom IXYS does not have long-term supply
agreements with. Any of these suppliers could terminate their
relationship with IXYS at any time. IXYSs reliance on a
limited number of suppliers involves several risks, including
potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of silicon
substrates and reduced control over the price, timely delivery,
reliability and quality of the silicon substrates. There can be
no assurance that problems will not occur in the future with
suppliers.   Employees
Covered by Collective Bargaining Arrangements   Approximately 150 IXYS employees in the United Kingdom and 278
in Germany have their annual pay increases negotiated by a labor
union.   Concentration
of Credit Risk   Financial instruments that potentially subject IXYS to credit
risk comprise principally cash and cash equivalents and trade
accounts receivable. IXYS invests its excess cash in accordance
with its investment policy that has been approved by the Board
of Directors and is reviewed periodically by management to
minimize credit risk. The policy authorizes the investment of
excess cash in government securities, tax exempt municipal
securities, Eurodollar notes and bonds, time deposits,
certificates of deposit, commercial paper rated AA or better and
other specific money market accounts and corporate instruments
of similar liquidity and credit quality.   IXYS invests its excess cash primarily in foreign and domestic
banks in short-term time deposit and money market accounts.
Maturities are generally three months or less. Additionally,
IXYS invests in commercial paper with financial institutions
that management believes to be creditworthy. These securities
mature within ninety days or less and bear minimal credit risk.
IXYS has not experienced any losses on such investments.   IXYS sells its products primarily to distributors and original
equipment manufacturers. IXYS performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers and generally does not require
collateral. An allowance for potential credit losses is
maintained by IXYS. See Note13, Segment and
Geographic Information for a discussion of revenues by
geography.   In the years ended March31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, no single
end-user customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues.
At March31, 2008 and 2007, one customer accounted for
118% and 106% of accounts receivable, respectively.   Stock-Based
Compensation Plans   The Company has employee equity incentive plans, which are
described more fully in Note3, Employee Equity
Incentive Plans. Effective April1, 2006, the Company
adopted the provisions of SFASNo123R, Share
based payment. SFASNo123R requires employee
stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock
participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value
method and requires the use of an option pricing model for
estimating fair value. Accordingly, share-based compensation is
measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award and
shares expected to vest.   Under the modified prospective method of adoption for
SFASNo123R, the compensation cost recognized by
the Company beginning in fiscal 2007 includes compensation cost
for all equity incentive awards granted prior to, but not yet
vested as of April1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair
value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
SFASNo123, and compensation cost for all equity
incentive awards granted subsequent to April1, 2006 based
on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of SFASNo123R. The Company uses the
straight-line attribution method to recognize share-based
compensation costs over the service period of the award.

SFASNo160. These standards aim to
improve, simplify, and converge internationally the accounting
for business combinations and the reporting of noncontrolling
interests in consolidated financial statements. The provisions
of SFASNo141R and SFASNo160 are
effective for the fiscal year beginning April1, 2009. The
Company is currently evaluating the provisions of
SFASNo141R and SFASNo160.   In March 2008, the FASB issued SFASNo161,
Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities an amendment of FASB Statement
No133 SFASNo161. The
standard requires additional quantitative disclosures provided
in tabular form and qualitative disclosures for derivative
instruments. The required disclosures include how derivative
instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys
financial position, financial performance, and cash flows;
relative volume of derivative activity; the objectives and
strategies for using derivative instruments; the accounting
treatment for those derivative instruments formally designated
as the hedging instrument in a hedge relationship; and the
existence and nature of credit-related contingent features for
derivatives. SFASNo161 does not change the
accounting treatment for derivative instruments.
SFASNo161 is effective for the Company for fiscal
quarter beginning after January1, 2009. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of SFASNo161.   The Company adopted FASB Interpretation No48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,
FIN48 as of April1, 2007 as required.

Purchase and Stock Option Plans   Stock
Options   Stock options may be granted under the 1999 Equity Incentive
Plan and the 1999 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive
Plan the Plans for not less than 85% of fair
market value at the time of grant. The options, once granted,
expire ten years from the date of grant. Options granted to
employees under the 1999 Equity Incentive Plan typically vest
over four years. The initial option grants under the 1999
Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan typically
vest over four years and subsequent annual grants vest over one
year. The Board of Directors has the full power to determine the
provisions of each option issued under the Plans. No options
have been granted below fair market value. During fiscal 2007,
the Company also began to grant options that contain net
exercise provisions. These options generally vest over a period
of four years. In a net exercise option, the number of shares
obtained by exercising the stock option is net of the number of
shares subject to the option that the Company cancels to cover
the aggregate exercise price.   Since inception, the cumulative amount authorized for the 1999
Equity Incentive Plan was approximately 116million
shares. The 1999 Equity Incentive Plan has an evergreen feature
that adds up to 1,000,000shares to the total shares
authorized each year at the discretion of the board. The 1999
Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan had a total
of 500,000shares authorized at its inception date. On
May20, 2008, the Board of Directors the
Board of IXYS approved the adoption of the 2008
Equity Incentive Plan the 2008 Plan, under which
3,500,000shares of the common stock of IXYS will be
reserved for the grant of stock options. The Board adopted a
resolution that no more than 200,000 additional shares will be
granted under the 1999 Equity Incentive Plan between
May21, 2008 and the plans expiration in May 2009 if
the 2008 Plan is approved by the stockholders.   Employee
Stock Purchase Plan   In May 1999, IXYS approved the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Purchase Plan and reserved 500,000shares of
common stock for issuance under the Purchase Plan. Under the
Purchase Plan, substantially all employees may purchase the
Companys common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower
of the fair market value at the beginning or the end of each
specified six-month offering period. Stock purchases are limited
to 15% of an employees eligible compensation. On
July31, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company
amended the Purchase Plan and reserved an additional
350,000shares of common stock for issuance under the
Purchase Plan. During the year ended March31, 2008, there
were 92,736shares purchased under the Purchase Plan,
leaving 328,977shares available for purchase under the
plan in the future.   Restricted
Stock Units   On May12, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company
amended the Companys 1999 Equity Incentive Plan to provide
for the grant of Restricted Stock Unit Awards
RSUs. Pursuant to a RSU award, the Company will,
in the future, deliver shares of the Companys common stock
if certain requirements, including continued performance of
services, are met. RSUs granted to employees typically vest over
four years. When vested, each RSU will entitle the holder of the
RSU award to one share of the Companys common stock.   Stock
Bonuses   Under the Plans, IXYS may also award shares of common stock as
stock bonuses.   Fair

STATEMENTSContinued   fair value method and requires the use of an option pricing
model for estimating fair value. Accordingly, share-based
compensation is measured at grant date, based on the fair value
of the award.   Under the modified prospective method of adoption for
SFASNo123R, the compensation cost recognized by
the Company beginning in fiscal 2007 includes compensation cost
for all equity incentive awards granted prior to, but not yet
vested as of, April1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair
value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
SFASNo123, and compensation cost for all equity
incentive awards granted on or after April1, 2006, based
on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of SFASNo123R. The Company uses the
straight-line attribution method to recognize share-based
compensation costs over the service period of the award. During
fiscal 2006, IXYS accelerated the vesting of the right to
purchase 920,250shares of its common stock pursuant to
previously granted stock options. The accelerated options had a
weighted average exercise price of $1299 per share and the
exercise prices were excess of the closing price on the date of
the acceleration. The vesting was accelerated to avoid future
accounting charges under SFASNo123R.   The fair value of issuances under the Companys Employee
Stock Purchase Plan is estimated on the issuance date by
applying the principles of FASB Technical

Assumptions were used in the calculation of fair value according
to the original provisions of SFASNo123.   The Company estimates the expected term of options granted based
on the historical average period over which the options are
exercised by employees. The Company estimates the volatility of
its common stock on historical volatility measures. The Company
bases the risk-free interest rate that it uses in the option
valuation model on U.S.Treasury zero-coupon issues with
remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options. The
Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the
foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield
of zero in the option valuation model. The Company is required
to estimate forfeitures at the time of grants and revise those
estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
from those estimates. The Company uses historical data to
estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based
compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to
vest. All stock-based payment awards are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the
awards, which are generally the vesting periods.   The Company recognizes the estimated compensation cost of
restricted stock over the vesting term. The estimated
compensation cost is based on the fair value of IXYSs
common stock on the date of grant.   The Company recognizes the compensation cost relating to stock
bonuses on the date of grant based on the fair value of
IXYSs common stock on the date of grant, as such stock
bonuses are vested immediately. The Company did not grant any
bonus shares during fiscal 2008.

Borrowing
Arrangements   IKB
Deutsche Industriebank   On June10, 2005, IXYS Semiconductor GmbH, a German
subsidiary of IXYS, borrowed 100million, or about
$122million at the time, from IKB Deutsche Industriebank
for a term of 15years.   The interest rate on the loan is determined by adding the then
effective three month Euribor rate and a margin. The margin can
range from 70basis points to 125basis points,
depending on the calculation of a ratio of indebtedness to cash
flow for the German subsidiary. During the first five years of
the loan, if the Euribor rate exceeds 375%, then the Euribor
rate for the purposes of the loan shall be 41%, and, if the
Euribor rate falls below 2%, then the Euribor rate for the
purposes of the loan shall be 3%. Thereafter, the interest rate
is recomputed annually. The interest rate at March31, 2008
was 48%.   Each fiscal quarter beginning with the quarter ended September
2005, during the first five years of the loan, a principal
payment of 167,000, or about $264,000, and a payment of
accrued interest will be required. Thereafter, the amount of the
payment will be recomputed.   Financial covenants for a ratio of indebtedness to cash flow, a
ratio of equity to total assets and a minimum stockholders
equity for the German subsidiary must be satisfied for the loan
to remain in good standing. The loan may be prepaid in whole or
in part at the end of a fiscal quarter without penalty. At
March31, 2008, the Company had complied with the financial
covenants. The loan is partially collateralized by a security
interest in the facility owned by IXYS in Lampertheim, Germany.   LaSalle
Bank National Association   On August2, 2007, IXYS Buckeye, LLC, a subsidiary of IXYS,
entered into an Assumption Agreement with LaSalle Bank National
Association, trustee for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Capital I
Inc., for the assumption of a loan of $75million in
connection with the purchase of property in Milpitas,
California. For further details regarding the acquisition of
property, see Note2. The loan carries a fixed annual
interest rate of 7455%. Monthly payments of principal and
interest of $56,000 are due under the loan. In addition, monthly
impound payments aggregating $13,000 are to be made for items
such as real property taxes, insurance and capital expenditures.
The loan is due and payable on February1, 2011. At
maturity, the remaining balance on the loan will be
approximately $71million. The loan is secured by a
guarantee from IXYS and collateralized by a security interest in
the property acquired. Aggregate loan costs of $93,000 incurred
in connection with the loan are amortized over the loan period
and the unamortized balance is shown net of the loan liability.   Aggregate debt maturities at March31, 2008 were:
$13million in fiscal 2009, $13million in fiscal
2010, $81million in fiscal 2011, $11million in

financial institutions of $620,000 and $169,000, respectively,
which were restricted as to use and represent compensating
balances for current or future discounted acceptances and
letters of credit. These balances are restricted for less than
one year and are included in restricted cash on the
Companys balance sheets.   IXYSCorporation guarantees, for certain events of default,
a $50million line of credit issued by a German bank to
IXYS Semiconductor GmbH to support a letter of credit facility.
At March31, 2008, there were approximately
$14million of open letters of credit to support inventory
purchases. Westcode had a Letter of Credit facility from a
British bank. At March31, 2008, there were approximately
315,000, or $628,000, of open letters of credit to support
inventory purchases. The bank also issued a guarantee on behalf
of the subsidiary for 121,000, or $241,000, in connection
with a product supply contract.   On occasion, the Company provides limited indemnification to
customers against intellectual property infringement claims
related to the Companys products. To date, the Company has
not experienced significant activity or claims related to such
indemnifications. The Company also provides in the normal course
of business indemnification to its officers, directors and
selected parties. The Company is unable to estimate the
potential future liability, if any; therefore, no liability for
these indemnification agreements has been recorded as of
March31, 2008 and 2007.   Legal
Proceedings   IXYS is currently involved in a variety of legal matters that
arise in the normal course of business. Were an unfavorable
ruling to occur, there could be a material adverse impact on its
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.   International
Rectifier   In June 2000, International Rectifier Corporation filed an
action for patent infringement against IXYS in the United States
District Court for the Central District of California, alleging
that certain of IXYSs products sold in the United States
infringed U.S.patents owned by International Rectifier.

STATEMENTSContinued   against IXYS contended that IXYSs alleged infringement of
International Rectifiers patents had been and continued to
be willful and deliberate. Subsequently, the U.S.District
Court decided that certain of IXYSs power MOSFETs and
IGBTs infringed patents owned by International Rectifier.   In September 2006, the U.S.District Court entered a
judgment for $62million in damages and issued a permanent
injunction barring IXYS from selling or distributing the
infringing products. Counsel to IXYS inadvertently did not file
the requisite notice of appeal following the entry of judgment
within the required time period. However, IXYS believes that its
counsel took timely corrective measures and that it is unlikely
that IXYSs appeal will be ultimately ruled to be late. In
January 2008, the appeal was argued before the United States
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In February 2008, the
Federal Circuit Court reversed the U.S.District Court,
vacated the damages award and the permanent injunction and ruled
that there shall be no further proceedings in the case regarding
any question of infringement. In March 2008, the Federal Circuit
Court refused to rehear the case. International Rectifier could
petition the U.S.Supreme Court to consider the Federal
Circuits ruling.   There can be no assurance of a favorable final outcome in the
International Rectifier suit. In the event of an adverse
outcome, damages awarded by the U.S.District Court would
be materially adverse to IXYSs financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.   LoJack   In April 2003, LoJack Corporation LoJack filed a
suit against Clare, Inc., a subsidiary of IXYS, in the Superior
Court of Norfolk County, Massachusetts claiming breach of
contract, unjust enrichment, breach of the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing, failure to perform services and
violation of a Massachusetts statute prohibiting unfair and
deceptive acts and practices, all purportedly resulting from
Clares alleged breach of a contract to develop custom
integrated circuits and a module assembly. In February 2006, the
jury awarded LoJack $367million in damages. In July 2006,
the Superior Court reduced LoJacks damages to
$4million. In July 2007, the Appeals Court ruled that
Clare owed LoJack $805,000 plus simple interest at the rate of
12% per annum from April 2003, which aggregated to
$12million. In September 2007, the Supreme Judicial Court
of Massachusetts denied the application for further appellate
review filed by LoJack. The denial by the Supreme Judicial Court
effectively concluded the material litigation between Clare and
LoJack. Clare paid LoJack $12million in accordance with
the opinion of the Appeals Court.

Employee
Savings and Retirement Plan   IXYS has a 401k plan, known as the IXYSCorporation
and Subsidiary Employee Savings and Retirement Plan.
Eligibility to participate in the plan is subject to certain
minimum service requirements. Employees may voluntarily
contribute up to 20% of yearly compensation and IXYS may make
matching contributions as determined by the Board of Directors
in a resolution on or before the end of the fiscal year.
Employees are 100% vested immediately in any contributions by
IXYS. For the years ended March31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
IXYS contributed $486,000, $519,000 and $396,000, respectively.   Westcode also started a defined contribution plan in fiscal 2007
known as Westcode Semiconductor Group Personal
Pension. The plan is subject to minimum service

Party Transactions   IXYS owns 45% of the outstanding equity of Powersem, a module
manufacturer based in Germany. The investment is accounted for
using the equity method. In fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, IXYS
recorded revenues of $27million, $24million and
$15million, respectively, from sales of products to
Powersem for use as components in their products. In fiscal
2008, 2007 and 2006, IXYS purchased $53million,
$28million and $31million, respectively, from
Powersem. At March31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the accounts
receivable balance from IXYSs sales to Powersem was
$292,000, $305,000 and $143,000, respectively. The accounts
payable balance of IXYS to Powersem, as of March31, 2008,
2007 and 2006, was $112,000, $261,000 and $129,000,
respectively. IXYS loaned Powersem $30,000, interest free, in
fiscal 2003. The loan was repaid in full on April12, 2006.   IXYS owns 20% of the outstanding equity of EB Tech Ltd, a
company with expertise in radiation technology based in South
Korea. The investment is accounted for using the equity method.
In fiscal 2008, EB Tech rendered processing services totaling
approximately $3,000 to IXYS. No services were rendered by EB
Tech in the fiscal years 2007 and 2006.   Omni Microelectronics, a consulting and engineering company

Pension
Plans   IXYS maintains two defined benefit pension plans:one for
United Kingdom employees and one for German employees. These
plans cover most of the employees in the United Kingdom and
Germany. Benefits are based on years of service and the
employees compensation. The Company deposits funds for
these plans, consistent with the requirements of local law, with
investment management companies, insurance companies or trustees
and/or
accrues for the unfunded portion of the obligations. The
measurement date for the projected benefit obligations and the
plan assets was March31, 2008, as required by
SFASNo158. Both the plans have been curtailed. As
such, the plans are closed to new entrants and no credit is
provided for additional periods of service.   Effective at the end of fiscal 2007, IXYS adopted the provisions
of SFASNo158. SFASNo158 required IXYS
to recognize the funded status of its defined benefit pension
plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a corresponding
adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of
tax. Application of SFASNo158 did not have any
impact on the consolidated financial position, primarily due to
curtailment of the pension plans.

Approximately 59% of the accrued pension liability relates to
the German plan and 41% to the United Kingdom plan.   The investment policies and strategies for the United Kingdom
plan assets of the plans are determined by the respective
plans trustees in consultation with independent investment
consultants and the employer. The Companys practice is to
fund these plans in amounts at least sufficient to meet the
minimum requirements of local laws and regulations. The trustees
are aware that the nature of the liabilities of the plans will
evolve as the age profile and life expectancy of the membership
changes. These changing liability profiles lead to consultations
about the appropriate balance of investment assets to be used by
the plans equity, debt, other, as well as timescales within
which required adjustments should be implemented. The plan
assets in the United Kingdom are held in pooled investment funds
operated by Fidelity Investments. The plan assets do not include
securities of the Company. There was an intermediate objective
to increase the debt proportion of the assets to approximately
25% of assets by 2007 by investing new contributions in debt and
by reducing equity investments. This objective has not been
achieved due to the relative investment returns. The investment
managers have discretion to vary the balance of investments of
the scheme according to prevailing investment conditions and the
Trustees regularly monitor all investment decisions affecting
the scheme and the overall investment performance. The plan
assets in Germany are held by a separate legal entity.   The long-term expected rate of return is a weighted average of
the returns expected for the underlying broad asset classes. The
expected returns for each asset class take into account the
market conditions on March31, 2008 and past performance of
the asset classes generally.   IXYS expects to make contributions to the plans of approximately
$957,000 in the fiscal year ending March31, 2009. This
contribution is primarily contractual. The allocation of the

The Companys management evaluates the recoverability of
these net deferred tax assets in accordance with
SFASNo109. As IXYS generates future taxable income

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   non-current intangible assets, or income tax expense will be
reported in such period. The Companys ability to utilize
its deferred tax assets and the continuing need for a related
valuation allowance are being monitored on an ongoing basis.
During the fourth quarter, IXYS recorded certain tax adjustments
on valuation allowance, tax contingency reserves, and other
temporary items. The impacts of these adjustments are discussed
further in this note. At March31, 2008, IXYS assessed its
ability to utilize net operating losses based on positive and
negative evidence and correspondingly released $891,000 of
valuation allowance for net operating losses that the Company
estimates to be utilizable.   At March31, 2008, IXYS had U.S.net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $369million, all of which
are subject to the limitations under section382 of the
U.S.tax code resulting from change in ownership. These
carry-forwards will expire, if not utilized, from fiscal 2009 to
2022 for U.S.tax purposes. None of the U.S.net
operating loss carry-forwards represent the stock option
deduction arising from activity under the Companys stock
option plan. IXYS had net operating loss carryforwards for
foreign income tax purposes of approximately $71million.   During fiscal 2008, the Companys valuation allowance
decreased by $15million from $82million as of
March31, 2007 to $67million as of March31,
2008. This was reflected as a reduction in goodwill of $816,000,
and in income tax expense of $684,000. The change in valuation
allowance from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 primarily relates to
the expected future taxable income of the Company in certain
jurisdictions.   During fiscal 2008, IXYSs deferred tax assets were
decreased by the tax benefits associated with the litigation
reserve. These benefits, credited directly to the income tax
expense, amounted to $51million. During fiscal 2007,
IXYSs deferred tax assets were decreased by the tax
benefits associated with the litigation reserve. These benefits,
credited directly to income tax expense, amounted to
$115million. This may cause the future effective tax rate
to fluctuate from year to year. IXYSs Swiss subsidiary has
a tax holiday that expires in 2010. The tax holiday reduced
income tax expense by approximately $359,000 in fiscal 2008 and
$400,000 in fiscal 2007.   As a result of the adoption of FIN48, the Company
recognized $62million for unrecognized tax benefits
primarily consisting of cross border transactions, pending
audits, tax credits and tax positions taken in prior periods. At
the adoption date, the Company had $62million of gross
unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would affect the
Companys effective tax rate if recognized. No valuation
allowance was placed on any of these unrecognized tax benefits.
At the end of the year, the Company had $46million of
gross unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would affect the
Companys effective tax rate if recognized. The Company
reclassified $41million from current taxes payable to
long-term taxes payable as of the adoption date. Since the
adoption of FIN48, the Companys FIN48
liability decreased by $22million principally due to
settlement of an audit and recognition of a tax item and
includes an increase of $393,000 of accrued interest and
penalties. The Company does not anticipate any unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12months that would result in a
material change to its financial position.   The Company includes interest and penalties recognized in
accordance with FIN48 in the financial statements as a
component of income tax expense. The Company had $412,000 of
accrued interest and penalties at March31, 2008.   Aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax

STATEMENTSContinued   IXYS has made no provision for U.S.income taxes on
undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries because
it is the Companys intention to permanently reinvest such
earnings in its foreign subsidiaries. If such earnings were
distributed, IXYS would be subject to additional
U.S.income tax expense. Determination of the amount of
unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these
earnings is not practicable.   Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of and benefits
from net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit
carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain
circumstances. Events that may restrict utilization of net
operating loss and credit carryforwards include, but are not
limited to, certain ownership change limitations and continuity
of business requirements as defined in Internal Revenue Code
Section382 and similar state provisions. In the event IXYS
had a change of ownership, defined as a cumulative ownership
change of more than 50% over a three-year period, utilization of
carryforwards could be restricted to an annual limitation. The
annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating
loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards before utilization.

$1185 per share that were not included in the computation of
dilutive net income per share since the exercise prices of the
options exceeded the market price of the common stock. These
options could dilute earnings per share in future periods. In
fiscal 2007 and 2006, there were outstanding options to purchase
1,374,574 and 2,179,943shares at weighted average exercise
prices per share of $1444 and $1134, respectively, that were
not included in the computation of net income loss per share
because their effect was anti-dilutive.

Controls
and Procedures   Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the
participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in
Rule13a-15e
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or
Exchange Act as of March31, 2008. This evaluation
included various processes that were carried out in an effort to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, reports is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified by the SEC. In this evaluation, the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer considered whether our
disclosure controls and procedures were also effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. This evaluation also included
consideration of certain aspects of our internal controls and
procedures for the preparation of our financial statements. Our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that, as of March31, 2008, our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective.   Managements
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act
Rules13a-15f
and
15d-15f.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of March31, 2008. In making this assessment, our
management used the criteria set forth in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework, which was issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Our management has concluded that, as of
March31, 2008, our internal control over financial
reporting was effective.   BDO Seidman, LLP BDO, the independent registered
public accounting firm that audited the financial statements
included in this Annual Report on
Form10-K,
has issued an attestation report on our internal control over
financial reporting, which is included elsewhere herein.   Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   We revised our calculations of the reserve for stock rotations
to make enhanced use of historical returns information.
Management also revised the methodology used to calculate the
reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. The methodology
includes a check for completeness as well as enhanced use of
historical sales information and product forecasts.
Additionally, management also altered the practice of searching
for unrecorded liabilities. This practice now includes an
enhanced review of liabilities exceeding a specified threshold.   Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls   Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, does not expect that our procedures or our
internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all
fraud. An internal control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of our controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues, errors and instances of fraud, if any, have
been detected.
