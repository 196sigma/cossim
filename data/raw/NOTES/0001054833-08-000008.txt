Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Coventry Health Care, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Coventry Health Care, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Coventry Health Care, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
As discussed in Note F to the consolidated financial statements, on January 1, 2006, Coventry Health Care, Inc. changed the method of accounting for stock-based compensation in accordance with guidance provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment. As discussed in Note G to the consolidated financial statements, Coventry Health Care, Inc. adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, effective January 1, 2007.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Coventry Health Care, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ Ernst Young, LLP Baltimore, Maryland

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 
A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Coventry Health Care, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, the Company or Coventry is a diversified national managed health care company based in Bethesda, Maryland operating health plans, insurance companies, network rental and workers compensation services companies. Through its Commercial Business, Individual Consumer Government Business and Specialty Business divisions, the Company provides a full range of risk and fee-based managed care products and services to a broad cross section of individuals, employer and government-funded groups, government agencies, and other insurance carriers and administrators. 
Since the Company began operations in 1987 with the acquisition of the American Service Companies entities, including Coventry Health and Life Insurance Company CHL, the Company has grown substantially through acquisitions. See Note B to these consolidated financial statements for information on the Companys most recent acquisitions.
Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of Presentation - The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are 100% owned. All inter-company transactions have been eliminated. 
Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those amounts. 
Significant Customers - The Companys commercial business is diversified across a large customer base and there are no commercial groups that make up 10% or more of Coventrys managed care premiums. The Company received 331%, 216% and 118% of its managed care premiums for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, from the federal Medicare program throughout its various markets. The Company also received 107%, 111% and 132% of its managed care premiums for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, from its state-sponsored Medicaid programs throughout its various markets. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the State of Missouri accounted for almost half the Companys Medicaid premiums. These revenues from the Medicare
and Medicaid Programs are included in the Individual Consumer Government Business division. The Company received 147%, 193% and 221% of its management services revenue from a single customer, Mail Handlers Benefit Plan, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively and is included in the Commercial Business division.
Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist principally of money market funds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. The Company considers all highly liquid securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value. 
Investments - The Company accounts for investments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115 - Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities and in accordance with FASB Staff Position Number FAS 115-1, The meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. The Company invests primarily in fixed income securities and classifies all of its investments as available-for-sale. Investments are evaluated on an individual security basis at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other-than-temporary. In making that determination, the Company considers all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence is reviewed at the individual security level and includes, but is not limited to, the following:   
adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer, monoline bond insurer, segment, industry, region or other variables;    
the length of the time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost;    
the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer;    
the Companys intent and ability to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value;    
elimination or reduction in dividend payments, or scheduled interest and principal;    
rating agency downgrade of a debt security; and    
expected cash flows of a debt security.  50 Temporary declines in value of investments classified as available-for-sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity. A decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be otherthantemporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. 
Investments with original maturities in excess of three months and less than one year are classified as short-term investments and generally consist of corporate bonds, U.S. Treasury notes and commercial paper. Long-term investments have original maturities in excess of one year and primarily consist of fixed income securities. 
Other Receivables - Other receivables include interest receivables, pharmacy rebate receivables, Office of Personnel Management OPM receivables, receivables from providers and suppliers and any other receivables that do not relate to premiums. 
Property and Equipment - Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost. In accordance with Statement of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and included in property and equipment. The Company capitalizes costs incurred during the application development stage for the development of internal-use software. These costs primarily relate to payroll and payroll-related costs for employees along with costs incurred for external consultants who are directly associated with the internal-use software project. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the related assets or, if shorter, over the terms of the respective leases. 
Long-term Assets - Long-term assets primarily include assets associated with the 401k Restoration and Deferred Compensation Plan, senior note issuance costs and reinsurance recoveries. The reinsurance recoveries were obtained with the acquisition of First Health Group Corp. First Health and are related to certain life insurance receivables from a third party insurer for liabilities that have been ceded to that third party insurer.
Business Combinations, Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangibles - The Company accounts for business combinations, goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with SFAS No. 141 - Business Combinations, SFAS No. 142 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and SFAS No. 144 - Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Acquired intangible assets are separately recognized upon meeting certain criteria. Such intangible assets include, but are not limited to, trade and service marks, non-compete agreements, customer lists and licenses. An intangible asset that is subject to amortization is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives are subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by
applying a fair-value-based test. The Company considers multiple approaches to identifying the fair value of its goodwill and other intangible assets. Those approaches include the market approach and the income approach. The market approach estimates a businesss fair value by analyzing the recent sales of similar companies. The income approach is based on the present value of expected future cash flows. As impairment charges occur, write-down charges will be recorded in the period in which the impairment took place. See Note C to consolidated financial statements for disclosure related to intangible assets. 
Medical Liabilities and Expense - Medical liabilities consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported. The estimated claims incurred but not reported are based on historical data, current enrollment, health service utilization statistics and other related information. In determining medical liabilities, the Company employs standard actuarial reserve methods that are specific to each markets membership, product characteristics, geographic territories and provider network. The Company also considers utilization frequency and unit costs of inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy and other medical expenses, as well as claim payment backlogs and the timing of provider reimbursements. The Company also establishes reserves, if required, for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance costs under
the group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts. These accruals are continually monitored and reviewed, and as settlements are made or accruals adjusted, differences are reflected in current operations. Changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term. 51 The following table shows the components of the change in medical liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively in thousands:

1 Acquisition balances represent medical liabilities of the acquired company as of the applicable acquisition date. 
2 Prior year reported medical costs in the current year as a percentage of prior year reported medical costs. 
3 Current year claim payments as a percentage of current year reported medical costs.  The negative amounts noted as prior year medical costs are favorable adjustments for claim estimates being settled for amounts less than originally anticipated. As noted above, these favorable changes from original estimates occur due to changes in medical utilization, mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trends. 
The Medicare Part D related subsidy liabilities identified in the table above represent subsidy amounts received from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS for reinsurance and for cost sharing related to low income individuals. These subsidies are recorded in medical liabilities and the Company does not recognize premium revenue or claims expense for these subsidies. Following the final settlement of each contract plan year, any remaining balances from these subsidy payments are refunded to CMS.
Other Long-term Liabilities - Other long-term liabilities consist primarily of liabilities associated with the 401K Restoration and Deferred Compensation Plan, the deferred tax liabilities associated with intangible assets, a limited partnership investment, and property, plant, and equipment, and the liability for unrecognized tax benefit. 
Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income includes net income and the unrealized net gains and losses on investment securities. Other comprehensive income is net of reclassification adjustments to adjust for items currently included in net income, such as realized gains and losses on investment securities. The deferred tax provision for unrealized holding gains arising from investment securities during the year ended December 31, 2007 was $63 million. The deferred tax benefit for unrealized holding losses arising from investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $002 million and $69 million, respectively. The deferred tax provision for reclassification adjustments for gains included in net income on investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2005 was $05 million and $08 million, respectively. The deferred tax benefit for
reclassification adjustments for losses included in net income on investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2006 was $02 million. 52 Revenue Recognition - Managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service. Premiums are based on a per subscriber contract rate and the subscribers in the Companys records at the time of billing. Premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month proceeding the month of coverage. Premium billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations, additions, or other changes. The Company also receives premium payments from Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS on a monthly basis for its Medicare membership. Membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with CMS and such reconciliations could result in adjustments to revenue. The Company also receives premium payments on a monthly basis from the state Medicaid programs with which
the Company contracts for the Medicaid members for whom it provides health coverage. Membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with the state Medicaid programs and such reconciliations could result in adjustments to revenue. Premiums collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. Employer contracts are typically on an annual basis, subject to cancellation by the employer group or by the Company upon 30 days notice.
The Medicare Part D program, gives beneficiaries access to prescription drug coverage. Coventry has been awarded contracts by CMS to offer various Medicare Part D plans on a nationwide basis, in accordance with guidelines put forth by the agency. Payments from CMS under these contracts include amounts for premiums, amounts for risk corridor adjustments and amounts for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies. 
The Company recognizes premium revenue ratably over the contract period for providing insurance coverage. Regarding the CMS risk corridor provision, an estimated risk sharing receivable or payable is recognized based on activity-to-date. Activity for CMS risk sharing is accumulated at the contract level and recorded within the consolidated balance sheet in other receivables or other accrued liabilities depending on the net contract balance at the end of the reporting period with corresponding adjustments to premium revenue. Costs for covered prescription drugs are expensed as incurred.
Subsidy amounts received for reinsurance and for cost sharing related to low income individuals are recorded in medical liabilities and will offset medical costs when paid. The Company does not recognize premium revenue or claims expense for these subsidies as the Company does not incur any risk with this part of the program.
A reconciliation of the final risk sharing, low-income subsidy, and reinsurance subsidy amounts is performed following the end of contract year. For both contract years of 2006 and 2007, as of December 31, 2007, the CMS risk sharing payable was $525 million and is included in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and the CMS risk sharing receivable was $40 million and is included in other receivables. As of December 31, 2007, the subsidy amounts payable totaled $620 million and is included in medical liabilities and the subsidy amounts receivable totaled $294 million and is included in other receivables. 
The Company has quota share arrangements on certain individual and employer groups with two of its Medicare distribution partners covering portions of the Companys Medicare Part D and Medicare Private Fee for Service businesses. As a result of the quota share sharing arrangements, the Company ceded premium revenue of $2502 million and the associated medical costs to these partners. The ceded amounts are excluded from the Companys results of operations. The Company is not relieved of its primary obligation to the policyholder under this ceding arrangement.
Management services revenue is generally a fixed administrative fee, provided on a predetermined contractual basis or on a percentage-of-savings basis, for access to the Companys health care provider networks and health care management services, for which it does not assume underwriting risk. Percentage of savings revenue is determined using the difference between charges billed by contracted medical providers and the contracted reimbursement rates for the services billed and is recognized based on claims processed. The management services the Company provides typically include health care provider network management, clinical management, pharmacy benefit management, bill review, claims repricing, fiscal agent services generally for state entitlement programs, claims processing, utilization review and quality assurance. 
The Company enters into performance guarantees with employer groups where it pledges to meet certain standards. These standards vary widely and could involve customer service, member satisfaction, claims processing, claims accuracy, telephone response time, etc. The Company also enters into financial guarantees which can take various forms including, among others, achieving an annual aggregate savings threshold, achieving a targeted level of savings per-member, per-month or achieving overall network penetration in defined demographic markets. For each guarantee, the Company estimates and records performance based revenue after considering the relevant contractual terms and the data available for the performance based revenue calculation. Pro-rata performance based revenue is recognized on an interim basis pursuant to the rights and obligations of each party upon termination of the contracts. 53 Revenue for pharmacy benefit management services in both the National Accounts business and the Public Sector is derived on a pre-negotiated contractual amount per claim. Revenue related to the administration of these transactions is recorded when the pharmacy transaction is processed by the Company but does not include revenue or expense related to the sale of pharmaceuticals. Revenue for pharmacy benefit management services for Workers Compensation business is derived on a pre-negotiated contractual amount per pharmacy claim which includes the cost of the pharmaceutical. Revenue and a corresponding cost of sales to a third party vendor related to the sale of pharmaceuticals is recorded when a pharmacy transaction is processed by the Company. Revenue associated with pharmacy rebates from the National Accounts business is recorded based on the contractual rebates received from
the formulary less the pre-negotiated rebates paid to clients. No rebate revenue is collected or recorded related to the Companys Public Sector or Workers Compensation business.
Based on information received subsequent to premium billings being sent, historical trends, bad debt write-offs and the collectibility of specific accounts, the Company estimates, on a monthly basis, the amount of bad debt and future retroactivity and adjusts its revenue and reserves accordingly. 
Premiums for services to federal employee groups are subject to audit and review by the OPM on a periodic basis. Such audits are usually a number of years in arrears. Adjustments are recorded as additional information regarding the audits and reviews becomes available. Any differences between actual results and estimates are recorded in the period the audits are finalized.
Cost of Sales This is a new line on the Companys statements of operations this year and is a direct result of the Workers Compensation business acquired from Concentra, Inc. Concentra. Cost of sales consists of the expense for prescription drugs provided by the Companys workers compensation pharmacy benefit manager and for the independent medical examinations performed by physicians on injured workers. These costs are associated with fee-based products and exclude the cost of drugs related to the risk products recorded in medical costs.
Contract Acquisition Costs Costs related to the acquisition of customer contracts, such as commissions paid to outside brokers, are paid on a monthly basis and expensed as incurred. Regarding the Companys Medicare Advantage business, it advances fund commissions and defer amortization of these costs to the period in which revenue associated with the acquired customer is earned, which is generally not more than one year.
Income Taxes The Company files a consolidated federal tax return for the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109 - Accounting for Income Taxes. The deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. See Note G to consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to income taxes. 
Earnings Per Share - Basic earnings per share based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share assume the exercise of all options and the vesting of all restricted stock using the treasury stock method. Potential common stock equivalents to purchase 32 million, 07 million and 02 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the potential common stock equivalents were anti-dilutive.
Other Income - Other income includes interest income, net of fees, of approximately $1387 million, $1015 million, and $598 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 respectively.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP FIN 48-1 Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48 FSP FIN 48-1. FSP FIN 48-1 provides guidance on how to determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. FSP FIN 48-1 is effective retroactively to January 1, 2007. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFASNo157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No157 to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 54 In February 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No159 permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 159 to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141 R, Business Combinations. SFAS No141 Rrequires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date, with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired. SFAS No141 Ris effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. The Company has not yet determined the effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements, if any, upon adoption of SFAS No141 R. 
B. ACQUISITIONS 
During the three years ended December 31, 2007, the Company completed five business combinations and one membership purchase. These business combinations are all accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of each acquisition have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements since their effective date of acquisition. The purchase price for each business combination was allocated to the assets, including the identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. The purchase price of the Companys membership purchases is allocated to identifiable intangible assets and is being amortized over a useful life of ten to fifteen years. 
The following table summarizes all business combinations and membership purchases for the three years ended December 31, 2007. The purchase price of each business combination includes the payment for net worth and estimated transition costs. The purchase price, inclusive of all retroactive balance sheet settlements to date and transition cost adjustments, is presented below in millions:

$  5,241  The unrealized loss reflected on each category of the Companys investments is almost exclusively the result of interest rate movements subsequent to the purchase of the investments. The Company has the ability and intent to hold those investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity. As a result, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2007.
Through its acquisition of First Health on January 28, 2005, the Company acquired eight separate investments tranches in a limited liability company that invests in equipment that is leased to third parties. The total investment as of December 31, 2007 was $519 million and is accounted for using the equity method. Coventrys proportionate share of the partnerships income since the date of the acquisition was $45, $67 and $46 million for the periods ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is included in other income. Coventry has between a 20% and 25% interest in the limited partners share of each individual tranche of the partnership approximately 10% of the total partnership.
Through its acquisition of Vista on September 10, 2007, the Company acquired a 50% investment in Carefree Insurance Services Carefree. Carefree performs marketing and sales of several Individual and Medicare products. As of December 31, 2007, the Companys total investment was $33 million and is accounted for using the equity method.
F. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
As of December 31, 2007, the Company had one stock incentive plan, the Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan the Stock Incentive Plan under which shares of the Companys common stock were authorized for issuance to key employees, consultants and directors in the form of stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based awards. Shares available for issuance under the Stock Incentive Plan were 70 million as of December 31, 2007.
Stock Options
Under the Stock Incentive Plan, the terms and conditions of option grants are established on an individual basis with the exercise price of the options being equal to not less than 100% of the fair value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. Options generally become exercisable after one year in 25% increments per year and expire ten years from the date of grant. At December 31, 2007, the Stock Incentive Plan had outstanding options representing 109 million shares of common stock.
The Company continues to use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model and amortizes compensation expense over the requisite service period of the grant. The methodology used in 2007 to derive the assumptions used in the valuation model is consistent with that used in 2006. The following average values and weighted-average assumptions were used for option grants.

The Company uses a risk-free interest rate consistent with the yield available on a U.S. Treasury note with a term equal to the expected term of the underlying grants. The expected volatility was estimated based upon a blend of the implied volatility of the Companys tradeable options and the historical volatility of the Companys share price. The expected life was estimated based upon exercise experience of option grants made in the past to Company employees. 59 The Company granted 23 million stock options during the twelve months ended December 31, 2007. The Black-Scholes-Merton weighted-average value of options granted was $ 1679, $1724 and $1496 per share for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company recorded compensation expense related to stock options of approximately $361 million and $307 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $779 million, $524 million and $838 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, there was $706 million of total unrecognized compensation cost net of expected forfeitures related to nonvested stock option grants which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 25 years.

The net operating loss carryforwards can be used to reduce future taxable income, and expire over varying periods through the year 2026. 61 The effect of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2007 and 2006 are presented below in thousands:

No valuation allowance is needed for 2007 and 2006 deferred tax assets because the Company believes that the realization of the deferred tax assets, including net operating losses, is likely due to the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, and expected future positive taxable income as a result of planned business and tax initiatives.
Current income taxes payable of $01 million and $841 million are included in Other Accrued Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.
The Companys current income taxes payable have been reduced by tax benefits resulting from equity based compensation transactions. These benefits were credited to shareholders equity and amounted to $315 million and $219 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.
In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes--an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For a tax benefit to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by applicable taxing authorities. The benefit recognized is the amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon final settlement of the tax position. The Company adopted FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. The change in net assets, because
of applying this pronouncement, is considered a change in accounting principle with the cumulative effect of the change required to be treated as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The cumulative effect of implementing FIN 48 was an increase of $34 million to the beginning balance of retained earnings. 62 A tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning and end of 2007 is as follows:

$   835  The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, as of December 31, 2007, that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate was $171 million. Further, the Company is unaware of any positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.
Penalties and tax-related interest expense are reported as a component of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2007, the total amount of income tax-related accrued interest and penalties, net of related tax benefit, recognized in the statement of financial position was $102 million. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the total amount of income tax-related accrued interest and penalties, net of related tax benefit, recognized in the statement of operations was $45 million. 
The Company is regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities, and from time to time these audits result in proposed assessments. Tax years 2004-2006 remain open to examination by these tax jurisdictions. The Company believes appropriate provisions for all outstanding issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years. 
During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Internal Revenue Service IRS completed its examination of the income tax returns of First Health Group Corporation FHGC for all years through 2003, except that the year ended December 31, 2003 remains open as a result of a claim filed related to the Research Development Credit. As of December 31, 2007, the IRS was in the process of examining FHGCs income tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2004 and the short year ended January 28, 2005, the date of FHGCs merger with the Company. As of December 31, 2007, the IRS had begun an examination of the Companys income tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2006. Additionally, the Company settled certain income tax examinations with various state tax authorities. Tax assessed as a result of these examinations, if
any, was not material. FHGC is also subject to ongoing examinations by state tax authorities for pre-acquisition years. The Company believes that adequate accruals have been provided for all FHGC open tax years, and the Company expects these accruals to be reclassified against goodwill upon settlement with the taxing authorities or upon the closing of the statute of limitations.

Legal Proceedings 
In the normal course of business, the Company has been named as a defendant in various legal actions such as actions seeking payments for claims denied by the Company, medical malpractice actions, employment related claims and other various claims seeking monetary damages. The claims are in various stages of proceedings and some may ultimately be brought to trial. Incidents occurring through December 31, 2007 may result in the assertion of additional claims. The Company maintains general liability, professional liability and employment practices liability insurances in amounts that it believes are appropriate, with varying deductibles for which it maintains reserves. The professional liability and employment practices liability insurances are carried through its captive subsidiary. Although the results of pending litigation are always uncertain, the Company does not believe the results of
such actions currently threatened or pending, including those described below, will individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
The Company is a defendant in the provider track of the In Re: Managed Care Litigation filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, Multi-District Litigation MDL, No. 1334, in the action captioned, Charles B. Shane., et al., vs. Humana, Inc., et al. This lawsuit was filed by a group of physicians as a class action against Coventry and nine other companies in the managed care industry. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act RICO, conspiracy to violate RICO and aiding and abetting a scheme to violate RICO. In addition to these federal law claims, the complaint included state law claims for breach of contract, violations of various state prompt payment laws and equitable claims for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit. The trial court dismissed several of the
state law claims and ordered all physicians who had an arbitration provision in their provider contracts to submit their direct RICO claims and their remaining state law claims to arbitration. As a consequence of this ruling, the plaintiffs who had arbitration provisions voluntarily dismissed their claims that were subject to arbitration. In its order, the trial court also held that the plaintiffs claims of 1 conspiracy to violate RICO and 2 aiding and abetting violations of RICO were not subject to arbitration. The trial court then certified various subclasses of plaintiffs with respect to these two federal law claims. 
Seven defendants entered into settlement agreements with the plaintiffs, which received final approval from the trial court. On June 16, 2006, the trial court filed an order in the Shane lawsuit which granted summary judgment on all claims in favor of Coventry. The trial court also granted summary judgment on all claims in favor of two other defendants. The plaintiffs appealed the trial courts summary judgment order to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. By an order dated June 13, 2007, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the trial courts order granting summary judgment in favor of the Company. The plaintiffs did not request reconsideration of the decision from the Eleventh Circuit nor did they seek to appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Shane lawsuit has triggered the filing of copycat class action complaints by other health care providers such as chiropractors,
podiatrists, acupuncturists and other licensed health care professionals. Each of these actions has been transferred to the MDL and have been designated as tag-along actions The Company has been named as a defendant in seven of these tag-along actions however, four of these actions have been subsequently dismissed/withdrawn against the Company. The trial court has entered an order which has stayed all proceedings in the tag-along actions. Although the Company can not predict the outcome, it believes that the tag-along actions will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. Management also believes that the claims asserted in these lawsuits are without merit and the Company intends to defend its position. 66 Capitation Arrangements 
A small percentage of the Companys membership is covered by global capitation arrangements. Under the typical arrangement, the provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all the medical costs provided to the globally capitated members. Under some capitated arrangements, physicians may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements. Global capitation arrangements limit the Companys exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose the Company to risk as to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider organization. In addition to global capitation arrangements, the Company has capitation arrangements for ancillary services, such as mental health care. The Company is ultimately responsible for the coverage of its members pursuant to the customer agreements. To the extent that the
respective provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangements, the Company will be required to perform such obligations. Consequently, the Company may have to incur costs in excess of the amounts it would otherwise have to pay under the original global or ancillary capitation arrangements. Medical costs associated with capitation arrangements made up approximately 49%, 61%, and 65% of the Companys total medical costs for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Membership associated with global capitation arrangements was approximately 110,000, 110,000 and 116,000 as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 
K. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK 
The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investments in fixed income securities and accounts receivable. The Company invests its excess cash in state and municipal bonds, U.S. Treasury and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt and other securities. Investments in marketable securities are managed within guidelines established by the Board of Directors, which only allow for the purchase of investment-grade fixed income securities and limit the amount that may be invested in any one issuer. The fair value of the Companys financial instruments is equivalent to their carrying value and, although there is some credit risk associated with these instruments, the Company believes this risk to be minimal. 
Concentration of credit risk with respect to receivables is limited due to the large number of customers comprising the Companys customer base and their breakdown among geographical locations. The Company believes the allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides for estimated losses as of December 31, 2007. The Company has a risk of incurring losses if such allowances are not adequate. 
L. STATUTORY INFORMATION 
The Companys regulated HMO and insurance company subsidiaries are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances, thereby limiting the dividends the parent may receive from its regulated entities. During 2007, the Company received $4216 million in dividends from its regulated subsidiaries and paid $719 million in capital contributions.
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC has proposed that states adopt risk-based capital RBC standards that, if adopted, would generally require higher minimum capitalization requirements for HMOs and other risk-bearing health care entities. RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for a managed care organization to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The managed care organizations RBC is calculated by applying factors to various assets, premiums and reserve items. The factor is higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for less risky items. The adequacy of a managed care organizations actual capital can then be measured by a comparison to its RBC as determined by the formula. The Companys health plans are required to submit
an RBC report to the NAIC and their domiciled states department of insurance with their annual filing. 
Regulators will use the RBC results to determine if any regulatory actions are required. Regulatory actions that could take place, if any, range from filing a financial action plan explaining how the plan will increase its statutory net worth to the approved levels, to the health plan being placed under regulatory control. 67 The majority of states in which the Company operates health plans have adopted a RBC policy that recommends the health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above the Company Action Level, which is currently equal to 200% of their RBC. The State of Florida does not currently use RBC methodology in its regulation of HMOs. Some states, in which the Companys regulated subsidiaries operate, require deposits to be maintained with the respective states departments of insurance. The table below summarizes the Companys statutory reserve information as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 in millions, except percentage data.

b As mentioned above, the State of Florida does not have a RBC requirement for its regulated HMOs. Accordingly, the statutory reserve information provided, for Vista, is based on the actual statutory minimum capital required by the State of Florida.  The increase in capital and surplus for the Companys regulated subsidiaries is a result of net earnings as well as the inclusion of the Vista and Mutual of Omaha acquisitions. This was partially offset by dividends paid to the parent company.
Excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation and excluding the Companys equity investments, the Company had cash and investments of approximately $4362 million and $5631 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to payments made for the Concentra, Mutual of Omaha and Vista acquisitions and payments made for share repurchases. These payments were partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the Companys Senior Notes, dividends received from the Companys regulated subsidiaries, and additional borrowings on the Companys credit facility.
M. OTHER INCOME 
Other income for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 includes interest income, net of fees, of approximately $1387 million, $1015 million and $598 million, respectively. 
N. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM 
The Companys Board of Directors has approved a program to repurchase its outstanding common stock. Stock repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices on the open market, by block purchase or in private transactions. In February 2007, its Board of Directors approved an increase to the share repurchase program in an amount equal to 5% of the Companys outstanding common stock, thus increasing its repurchase authorization by 79 million shares. Under the share repurchase program, the Company purchased 75 million shares of the Companys common stock during 2007, at an aggregate cost of $4290 million, 46million shares during 2006, at an aggregate cost of $2561million and no shares were purchased in 2005. The total remaining common shares the Company is authorized to repurchase under this program is 65 million as of December31, 2007.
Excluded from these amounts are shares purchased in exchange for employee payroll taxes on vesting of restricted stock awards as these purchases are not part of the program.
O. SEGMENT INFORMATION 
Through an effort to further integrate the First Health business acquired on January 28, 2005, the Company in 2007 has realigned into new operating units which are based on the product sold. The Companys new organizational structure, effective January 1, 2007, capitalizes on existing synergies and brings enhanced focus on areas of growth opportunities. As a result of the new organizational structure, the Companys reportable segments have changed. The Company has three reportable segments: Commercial, Individual Consumer Government, and Specialty. Each of the Companys three new segments is managed separately and separate operating results are available that are evaluated by the chief operating decision maker. The Commercial Business Division is comprised of all of the Companys commercial employer-focused businesses, including the traditional health plan group
risk and ASO products as well as the National Accounts, Federal Employees Health Benefit Plans, and Network Rental businesses. The Individual Consumer Government Division contains the Companys individual consumer products and all Medicare and Medicaid products. The Specialty Division includes the Companys workers compensation services businesses. 68 The Commercial Business Division provides commercial HMO, PPO and POS products to a cross section of employer groups of all sizes through its health plans. HMO products provide comprehensive health care benefits to members primarily through a primary care physician. PPO and POS products permit members to participate in managed care but allow them the flexibility to utilize out-of-network providers in exchange for increased out-of-pocket costs. Additionally, the Commercial Business Division provides network rental services and other managed care products through a national PPO network to national, regional and local third party administrators and insurance carriers.
The Individual Consumer Government Division provides comprehensive health benefits to members participating in the Medicare Advantage HMO, Medicare Advantage PPO, Medicare Advantage Private-Fee-For-Service, Medicare Prescription Drug, and Medicaid programs and receives premium payments from federal and state governments. This division also provides commercial fully-insured managed care services on an individual basis and offers products and services more specialized to the needs of state governments such as pharmacy benefit management, clinical management and fiscal intermediary services on a fee-for-service basis.
The Specialty Business Division currently provides workers compensation managed care services on a fee-based basis, including access to the Companys provider network, pharmacy benefits management, field case management, telephonic case management, independent medical exam and bill review capabilities. This division includes the workers compensation managed care services businesses acquired from Concentra on April 2, 2007. See Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Concentra acquisition.
The table below summarizes the operating results of the Companys reportable segments in thousands. Total operating expenses for the Commercial and Individual Consumer Government Divisions are not segregated internally and, as a result, are aggregated. Other represents the elimination of fees charged among segments. Disclosure of total assets by reportable segment has not been included as such assets are not reported on a segment basis internally by the Company and are not reviewed separately by the Companys chief operating decision maker.

Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Coventrys management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Companys assets; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Companys management and directors; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Coventrys management has performed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 based on criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, Internal Controls Integrated Framework, and believes that the COSO framework is a suitable framework for such an evaluation. Management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007. 
Managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting excludes the evaluation of the internal controls over financial reporting of the Concentra, Mutual of Omaha and Vista acquisitions, collectively the acquisitions which were acquired by the Company during 2007. The aggregated total assets and total operating revenues of these operations represent approximately 51% and 76%, respectively, of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007.
The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Companys consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007, and their opinion is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We have performed an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15e promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2007 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Changes to certain processes, information technology systems and other components of internal control over financial reporting resulting from the acquisitions may occur and will be evaluated by management as such integration activities are implemented. 71 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Coventry Health Care, Inc. 
We have audited Coventry Health Care, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Coventry Health Care, Incs management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As indicated in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, managements assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the Concentra, Mutual of Omaha and Vista acquisitions which are included in the 2007 consolidated financial statements of Coventry Health Care, Inc. The aggregated total assets and total operating revenues of these operations represent approximately 51% and 76%, respectively, of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Coventry Health Care, Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the Concentra, Mutual of Omaha and Vista acquisitions.
In our opinion, Coventry Health Care, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, Coventry Health Care, Inc.s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 of Coventry Health Care, Inc., and our report dated February 28, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ Ernst Young, LLP Baltimore, Maryland
