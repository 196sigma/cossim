MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON 
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of Marriott International, Inc. the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the Companys transactions and dispositions of the
Companys assets; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Companys management and directors; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In connection with the preparation of the Companys annual consolidated financial statements, management has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. 
Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, applying the COSO criteria, as of December31, 2010, the Companys
internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Companys
consolidated financial statements included in this report, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting, a copy of which appears on the next page of this annual report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Marriott International, Inc.: 
We have audited Marriott International, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010, based on
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Marriott International, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. In our opinion, Marriott International, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Marriott International, Inc. as of December31, 2010 and January1, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income,
comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows, for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December31, 2010, of Marriott International, Inc. and our report dated February18, 2011 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.  /s/ Ernst Young LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of Presentation 
The consolidated financial statements present the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of Marriott International,
Inc. Marriott, and together with its subsidiaries we, us, or the Company. In order to make this report easier to read, we refer throughout to iour Consolidated Financial Statements as our
Financial Statements, iiour Consolidated Statements of Income as our Income Statements, our Consolidated Balance Sheets as our Balance Sheets, iiiour properties, brands or markets in the
continental United States and Canada as North America or North American, ivour properties, brands or markets outside of the continental United States and Canada as international, and vAccounting
Standards Update No2009-16, Transfers and Servicing Topic 860: Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets ASU No2009-16 and Accounting Standards Update No2009-17, Consolidations Topic 810:
Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities ASU No2009-17 both of which we adopted on the first day of 2010 as the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation
standards. In accordance with the guidance for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements,
references in this report to our earnings per share, net income, and shareholders equity attributable to Marriott do not include noncontrolling interests previously known as minority interests, which we report separately. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods, and the disclosures of
contingent liabilities. Accordingly, ultimate results could differ from those estimates. Because we permanently shut down our
synthetic fuel business in 2007, we segregated the balances and activities of our synthetic fuel reportable segment and report them as discontinued operations for all periods presented. 
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present
fairly our financial position at fiscal year-end 2010 and fiscal year-end 2009 and the results of our operations and cash flows for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008. We have eliminated all material intercompany transactions and balances between
entities consolidated in these financial statements. We have also reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to our 2010 presentation. 
Adoption of New Accounting Standards Resulting in Consolidation of Special Purpose Entities 
On January2, 2010, the first day of the 2010 fiscal year, we adopted the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation
standards which were originally known as Financial Accounting Standards Nos. 166 and 167. We use certain special purpose
entities to securitize Timeshare segment notes receivables, which prior to our adoption of these new standards we treated as off-balance sheet entities. We retain the servicing rights and varying subordinated interests in the securitized notes.
Pursuant to GAAP in effect prior to the 2010 fiscal year, we did not consolidate these special purpose entities in our financial statements because the securitization transactions qualified as sales of financial assets. 
As a result of adopting the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards on the first day of 2010, we consolidated 13
existing qualifying special purpose entities associated with past securitization transactions. We recorded a one-time non-cash pretax reduction to shareholders equity of $238 million in 2010, representing the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle. Including the related $92 million decrease in deferred tax liabilities, the after-tax reduction to shareholders equity totaled $146 million. The one-time non-cash after-tax reduction to shareholders equity was
approximately $41 million greater than we had estimated for this charge, as disclosed in our 2009 Form 10-K, primarily due to increased notes receivable reserves recorded for the newly consolidated notes receivable. This increase in reserves was due
to a change in estimate of uncollectible accounts based on historical experience. We now reserve for 100 percent of notes that are in default in addition to the reserve we record on the remaining notes. 
We recorded the cumulative effect of the adoption of these standards to our financial statements in 2010. This consisted primarily of
reestablishing the notes receivable net of reserves that we had transferred to special purpose entities as a result of the securitization transactions, eliminating residual interests that we initially recorded in connection with those transactions
and subsequently revalued on a periodic basis, the impact of recording debt obligations associated with 
70 Table of Contents
third-party interests held in the special purpose entities, and related adjustments to inventory balances accounted for using the relative sales value method. We adjusted the inventory balance to
include anticipated future revenue from the resale of inventory that we expect to acquire when we foreclose on defaulted notes. 
Adopting these topics had the following impacts on our Balance Sheet at January2, 2010: 1assets increased by $970 million,
primarily representing the consolidation of notes receivable and corresponding reserves partially offset by the elimination of our retained interests; 2liabilities increased by $1,116 million, primarily representing the consolidation of
debt obligations associated with third party interests; and 3shareholders equity decreased by approximately $146 million. Adopting these topics also impacted our 2010 Income Statement by increasing interest income reflected in
Timeshare sales and services revenue from securitized notes and increasing interest expense from consolidation of debt obligations, partially offset by the absence of accretion income on residual interests that were eliminated. We do not expect to
recognize gains or losses from future securitizations of our timeshare notes as a result of the adoption of these topics. Our adoption of these topics on January 2, 2010 did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow
because the resulting increase in assets and liabilities was primarily non-cash. Please also see the parenthetical
disclosures on our Balance Sheets that show the amounts of consolidated assets and liabilities associated with variable interest entities including those associated with our Timeshare segment securitizations that we consolidated. Also see the
New Accounting Standards caption later in this footnote for additional information regarding ASU Nos. 2009-16 and 2009-17. 
Fiscal Year Our fiscal
year ends on the Friday nearest to December31. The fiscal years in the following table encompass a 52-week period, except for 2002 and 2008, which both encompass a 53-week period. Unless otherwise specified, each reference to a particular year
in this Form 10-K means the fiscal year ended on the date shown in the following table, rather than the corresponding calendar year:  FiscalYear

Recognition Our revenues include: 1base management and incentive management fees; 2franchise fees;
3revenues from lodging properties owned or leased by us; 4timeshare sales and services, which also includes resort rental revenue, interest income associated with our Loans to timeshare owners, Timeshare segment note
securitization gains, and revenue from our points-based use system; and 5cost reimbursements. Management fees comprise a base fee, which is a percentage of the revenues of hotels, and an incentive fee, which is generally based on hotel
profitability. Franchise fees comprise initial application fees and continuing royalties generated from our franchise programs, which permit the hotel owners and operators to use certain of our brand names. Cost reimbursements include direct and
indirect costs that are reimbursed to us by lodging properties that we manage or franchise. Base Management and Incentive
Management Fees: We recognize base management fees as revenue when earned in accordance with the contract. In interim periods and at year-end, we recognize incentive management fees that would be due as if the contract were to terminate at that
date, exclusive of any termination fees payable or receivable by us. Franchise Fee Revenue: We recognize franchise
fees as revenue in each accounting period as fees are earned from the franchisee. Owned and Leased Units: We recognize
room sales and revenues from other guest services for our owned and leased units when rooms are occupied and services have been rendered. Timeshare and Fractional Intervals and Condominiums: We recognize sales when: 1we have received a minimum of ten percent of the purchase price; 2the purchasers period to
cancel for a refund has expired; 3we deem the receivables to be collectible; and 4we have attained certain minimum sales and construction levels. We defer all revenue using the deposit method for sales that do not meet all four of
these criteria. For sales that do not qualify for full revenue recognition as the project has progressed beyond the preliminary stages but has not yet reached completion, all revenue and profit are deferred and recognized in earnings using the
percentage of completion method. Timeshare segment deferred revenue at year-end 2010 and 2009 was $56 million and $63 million, respectively. 
71 Table of Contents
Timeshare Points-Based Use System Revenue: As sales under this points-based use
system are considered to be the sale of real estate, we recognize these sales when the criteria noted in the Timeshare and Fractional Intervals and Condominiums caption are met. 
Timeshare Residential Stand-Alone Structures: We recognize sales under the full accrual method of accounting when we receive our
proceeds and transfer title at settlement. Cost Reimbursements: We recognize cost reimbursements from managed,
franchised, and timeshare properties when we incur the related reimbursable costs. Other Revenue: Includes third-party licensing fees,
branding fees for third party residential sales and credit card licensing, land rental income, and other revenue. Ground Leases
We are both the lessor and lessee of land under long-term operating leases, which include scheduled increases in minimum
rents. We recognize these scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the initial lease term. Real Estate Sales 
We reduce gains on sales of real estate by the maximum exposure to loss if we have continuing involvement with the property and do not
transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. In sales transactions where we retain a management contract, the terms and conditions of the management contract are generally comparable to the terms and conditions of the management
contracts obtained directly with third-party owners in competitive bid processes. Profit Sharing Plan 
We contribute to a profit sharing plan for the benefit of employees meeting certain eligibility requirements and electing participation in
the plan. Contributions are determined based on a specified percentage of salary deferrals by participating employees. We recognized compensation costs from profit sharing of $86 million in 2010, $94 million in 2009, and $111 million in 2008.
Self-Insurance Programs We are self-insured for certain levels of property, liability, workers compensation and employee medical coverage. We accrue estimated costs of these self-insurance programs at the present value of
projected settlements for known and incurred but not reported claims. We use a discount rate of 20 percent to determine the present value of the projected settlements, which we consider to be reasonable given our history of settled claims,
including payment patterns and the fixed nature of the individual settlements. We are subject to a variety of assessments
related to our insurance activities, including those by state guaranty funds and workers compensation second-injury funds. Our liabilities recorded for assessments are reflected within the amounts shown in our Balance Sheets on the other
current liabilities line, are not discounted, and totaled $5 million at year-end 2010 and $4 million at year-end 2009. The $5 million liability for assessments as of year-end 2010 is expected to be paid by the end of 2011. 
Our Rewards Programs 
Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards are our frequent guest loyalty programs. Program members earn points based on their monetary
spending at our lodging operations, purchases of timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential products and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners programs, such as those offered by car rental and credit
card companies. Points, which we track on members behalf, can be redeemed for stays at most of our lodging operations, airline tickets, airline frequent flyer program miles, rental cars, and a variety of other awards; however, points cannot be
redeemed for cash. We provide Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards as marketing programs to participating properties, with the objective of operating the programs on a break-even basis to us. As members earn points at properties and other
program partners, we sell the points for amounts that we expect will, in the aggregate, equal the costs of point redemptions and program operating costs over time. We defer revenue received from managed, franchised, and Marriott-owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the
future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including an estimate of the breakage for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the
points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgment factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. Our rewards programs liability totaled $1,799 million and $1,647 million at year-end 2010 and 2009, respectively. A ten
percent reduction in the estimate of breakage would have resulted in an estimated $90 million increase in the liability at year-end 2010. 
72 Table of Contents
Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the
costs of operating the program, including marketing, promotion, communication with, and performing member services for rewards program members. Due to the requirement that properties reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we recognize
the related cost reimbursements revenues from properties in connection with our rewards programs at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance
services over the expected life of the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed. 
Guarantees We record a
liability for the fair value of a guarantee on the date a guarantee is issued or modified. The offsetting entry depends on the circumstances in which the guarantee was issued. Funding under the guarantee reduces the recorded liability. When no
funding is forecasted, the liability is amortized into income on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the guarantee. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate all material estimated liabilities based on the operating results and the terms of the
guarantee. If we conclude that it is probable that we will be required to fund a greater amount than previously estimated, we will record a loss unless the advance would be recoverable in the form of a loan. 
Rebates and Allowances 
We participate in various vendor rebate and allowance arrangements as a manager of hotel properties. There are three types of programs
that are common in the hotel industry that are sometimes referred to as rebates or allowances, including unrestricted rebates, marketing restricted rebates and sponsorships. The primary business purpose of these
arrangements is to secure favorable pricing for our hotel owners for various products and services or enhance resources for promotional campaigns co-sponsored by certain vendors. More specifically, unrestricted rebates are funds returned to the
buyer, generally based upon volumes or quantities of goods purchased. Marketing restricted allowances are funds allocated by vendor agreements for certain marketing or other joint promotional initiatives. Sponsorships are funds paid by vendors,
generally used by the vendor to gain exposure at meetings and events, which are accounted for as a reduction of the cost of the event. We account for rebates and allowances as adjustments of the prices of the vendors products and services. We show vendor costs and the reimbursement of those costs as reimbursed costs and cost
reimbursements revenue, respectively; therefore, rebates are reflected as a reduction of these line items. Cash and Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less at date of purchase to be cash
equivalents. Restricted Cash Restricted cash in our Balance Sheets at year-end 2010 and year-end 2009 is recorded as $55 million and $54 million, respectively, in the Other current assets line and $30 million and $22
million, respectively, in the Other long-term assets line. Restricted cash primarily consists of cash held in a reserve account related to Timeshare segment notes receivable securitizations; cash held internationally that we have not
repatriated due to statutory, tax and currency risks; and deposits received, primarily associated with timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential sales that are held in escrow until the associated contract has closed. 
Assets Held for Sale We
consider properties other than Timeshare segment interval, fractional ownership, and residential products, which we classify as inventory to be assets held for sale when all of the following criteria are met:  management commits to a plan to sell a property;  it is unlikely that the disposal plan will be significantly modified or discontinued;  the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition;  actions required to complete the sale of the property have been initiated;  sale of the property is probable and we expect the completed sale will occur within one year; and  the property is actively being marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable given its current market value. 
73 Table of Contents
Upon designation as an asset held for sale, we record the carrying value of each property at
the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell, and we cease depreciation. At
year-end 2010 and 2009, we had no assets held for sale or liabilities related to assets held for sale. Loan Loss Reserves 
Senior, Mezzanine, and Other Loans We make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise, typically to facilitate the development of a hotel and sometimes to facilitate brand programs or initiatives. We expect the owners to repay
the loans in accordance with the loan agreements, or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit. We use metrics such as loan-to-value ratios, debt service coverage, collateral, etc., to assess the credit quality of the loan receivable
upon entering into the loan agreement and on an ongoing basis as applicable. On a regular basis, we individually assess all
of these loans for impairment. Internally generated cash flow projections are used to determine if the loans are expected to be repaid according to the terms of the loan agreements. If it is probable that a loan will not be repaid in accordance with
the loan agreement, we consider the loan impaired and begin recognizing interest income on a cash basis. To measure impairment, we calculate the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest
rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. If the present value or the estimated collateral is less than the carrying value of the loan receivable, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference. 
If it is likely that a loan will not be collected based on financial or other business indicators, including our historical experience,
it is our policy to charge off these loans in the quarter when it is deemed uncollectible. Loans to Timeshare Owners
We record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on all notes receivable from timeshare purchasers as a reduction of
revenue at the time we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We fully reserve all defaulted notes in addition to recording a reserve on the estimated uncollectible portion of the remaining notes. For those notes not in default, we assess
collectibility based on pools of receivables because we hold large numbers of homogeneous timeshare notes receivable. We estimate uncollectibles for the pool based on historical activity for similar timeshare notes receivable. 
Although we consider loans to timeshare owners past due if we do not receive payment within 30 days of the due date, we suspend accrual
of interest only on those that are over 90 days past due. We consider loans over 150 days past due to be in default. We apply payments we receive for loans on non-accrual status first to interest, then principal, and any remainder to fees. We resume
accruing interest when loans are less than 90 days past due. We do not accept payments for notes during the foreclosure process unless the amount is sufficient to pay all principal, interest, fees and penalties owed and fully reinstate the note. We
write uncollectible notes off against the reserve once we receive title through the foreclosure or deed-in-lieu process. At year-end 2010, we estimated an average remaining default rate of 925 percent for both non-securitized and securitized
timeshare notes receivable. An increase of 05 percent in the estimated default rate would have resulted in an increase in our allowance for credit losses of $6 million. For additional information on our notes receivable, including information on the related reserves, see Footnote No11, Notes Receivable. 
Valuation of Goodwill 
We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments at the end of each fiscal year, or during the year if an event or
other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. In the first step of the review process, we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the estimated fair value
of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further analysis is needed. If the estimated fair value of the
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we proceed to the second step of the review process to calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill in order to determine whether any impairment is required. We calculate the
implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill by allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. If the
carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss for that excess amount. In allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and
liabilities of the reporting unit, we use industry and market data, as well as knowledge of the industry and our past experiences. 
74 Table of Contents
We base our calculation of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit on the income
approach. For the income approach, we use internally developed discounted cash flow models that include, among others, the following assumptions: projections of revenues and expenses and related cash flows based on assumed long-term growth rates and
demand trends; expected future investments to grow new units; and estimated discount rates. We base these assumptions on our historical data and experience, third-party appraisals, industry projections, micro and macro general economic condition
projections, and our expectations. We have not recorded a goodwill impairment charge in the last three fiscal years, and at
year-end 2010, the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its respective carrying amount by more than 100 percent based on our models and assumptions. 
For additional information related to goodwill, including the amounts of goodwill by segment, see Footnote No17, Business
Segments. Investments We consolidate entities that we control. We account for investments in joint ventures using the equity method of accounting when we exercise significant influence over the venture. If we do not exercise
significant influence, we account for the investment using the cost method of accounting. We account for investments in limited partnerships and limited liability companies using the equity method of accounting when we own more than a minimal
investment. Our ownership interest in these equity method investments varies generally from 10 percent to 49 percent. The
fair value of our available-for-sale securities totaled $18 million and $18 million at year-end 2010 and year-end 2009, respectively. The amount of net losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the sale
of available-for-sale securities totaled zero and $4 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively. We determined the cost basis of the securities sold using specific identification. Costs Incurred to Sell Real Estate Projects We charge the majority of
sales and marketing costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred. Deferred selling and marketing costs were $6 million at year-end 2010 and $5 million at year-end 2009 and are included in the accompanying Balance Sheets in the
Other caption within the Current assets section. If a contract is canceled, we charge unrecoverable direct selling and marketing costs to expense and record deposits forfeited as income. 
Valuation of Intangibles and Long-Lived Assets We test intangibles and long-lived asset groups for recoverability when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, for example, when there are material adverse changes in
projected revenues or expenses, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results, and significant negative industry or economic trends. We also perform a test for recoverability when management has committed to a
plan to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset group and the plan is expected to be completed within a year. We evaluate recoverability of an asset group by comparing its carrying value to the future net undiscounted cash flows that we expect will be
generated by the asset group. If the comparison indicates that the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss for the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value. When an impairment loss is
recognized for assets to be held and used, we depreciate the adjusted carrying amount of those assets over their remaining useful life. We base our calculations of the estimated fair value of an intangible asset or asset group on the income approach or the market approach. The assumptions and methodology we utilize for the income approach
are the same as those described in the Valuation of Goodwill caption. For the market approach, we use internal analyses based primarily on market comparables and assumptions about market capitalization rates, growth rates, and inflation.
For information on impairment losses that we recorded in 2009 and 2008 associated with intangibles and long-lived assets, see
Footnote No20, Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges and Footnote No21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10-K. For information on impairment losses
that we recorded in 2010 associated with long-lived assets, see Footnote No8, Property and Equipment. Valuation of
Investments in Ventures We sometimes hold a minority equity interest in ventures established to develop timeshare
interval, fractional ownership and residential properties or to develop or acquire and own hotel properties. These ventures are generally limited liability companies or limited partnerships, and our equity interest in these ventures generally ranges
from 10 percent to 49 percent. 
75 Table of Contents
We evaluate an investment in a venture for impairment when circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, for example due to loan defaults, significant under performance relative to historical or projected operating performance and significant negative industry or economic trends. 
We impair investments accounted for using the equity and cost methods of accounting when we determine that there has been
an other than temporary decline in the estimated fair value as compared to the carrying value, of the venture. Additionally, a commitment to a plan to sell some or all of the assets in a venture could cause a recoverability evaluation
for the individual long-lived assets in the venture and possibly the venture itself. We calculate the
estimated fair value of an investment in a venture using either a market approach or an income approach. The assumptions and methodology we utilize for the income approach are the same as those described in the Valuation of Goodwill
caption. For the market approach, we use internal analyses based primarily on market comparables and assumptions about market capitalization rates, growth rates, and inflation. 
For information regarding impairment losses that we recorded in 2009 and 2008 associated with investments in ventures,
see Footnote No20, Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges and Footnote No21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges in the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2009 Form 10-K. 
Timeshare Segment Residual Interests We periodically securitize notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment. We continue to service the notes after securitization, and we retain servicing assets and other interests in the notes.
Historically, we accounted for these residual interests, including the servicing assets, as trading securities under the then-applicable standards for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. At the dates of sale and at the
end of each reporting period, we estimated the fair value of our residual interests using a Level 3 discounted cash flow model. For additional information, including the elimination of our residual interests upon adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards, see the Adoption of New Accounting
Standards Resulting in Consolidation of Special Purpose Entities caption of this footnote, Footnote No5, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, and Footnote No12, Asset Securitizations. 
Fair Value Measurements We have various financial instruments we must measure at fair value on a recurring basis, including certain marketable securities and derivatives. See Footnote No5, Fair Value of Financial
Instruments, for further information. We also apply the provisions of fair value measurement to various non-recurring measurements for our financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. 
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price. We measure our assets and liabilities using inputs from the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy: 
Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at
the measurement date. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted
prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc., and inputs that are derived principally
from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means market corroborated inputs. Level 3 includes
unobservable inputs that reflect our assumptions about what factors market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. We develop these inputs based on the best information available, including our own data. 
Derivative Instruments The designation of a derivative instrument as a hedge and its ability to meet the hedge accounting criteria determine how we reflect the change in fair value of the derivative instrument in our Financial
Statements. A derivative qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception, we expect the derivative to be highly effective in offsetting the underlying hedged cash flows or fair value and we fulfill the hedge documentation standards at the time we
enter into the derivative contract. We designate a hedge as a cash flow hedge, fair value hedge, or a net investment in non-U.S. operations hedge based on the exposure we are hedging. The asset or liability value of the derivative will change in
tandem with its fair value. For the effective portion of qualifying hedges, we record changes in fair value in other comprehensive income OCI. We release the derivatives gain or loss from OCI to match the timing of the underlying
hedged items effect on earnings. 
76 Table of Contents
We review the effectiveness of our hedging instruments on a quarterly
basis, recognize current period hedge ineffectiveness immediately in earnings, and discontinue hedge accounting for any hedge that we no longer consider to be highly effective. We recognize changes in fair value for derivatives not designated as
hedges or those not qualifying for hedge accounting in current period earnings. Upon termination of cash flow hedges, we release gains and losses from OCI based on the timing of the underlying cash flows or revenue recognized, unless the termination
results from the failure of the intended transaction to occur in the expected timeframe. Such untimely transactions require us to immediately recognize in earnings, gains and losses that we previously recorded in OCI. 
Changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, and equity securities expose us to market risk. We manage our
exposure to these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, as well as through development and application of credit granting policies. We also use derivative instruments, including cash flow hedges, net investment in non-U.S. operations
hedges, fair value hedges, and other derivative instruments, as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks. As a matter of policy, we only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the
underlying risk, and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. See Footnote No5, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, for additional information. 
Non-U.S. Operations The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our consolidated and unconsolidated entities operating in the United States. The functional currency for our consolidated and unconsolidated entities
operating outside of the United States is generally the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. For consolidated entities whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we translate
their financial statements into U.S. dollars, and we do the same, as needed, for unconsolidated entities whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We translate assets and liabilities at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial
statement date, and translate income statement accounts using the weighted average exchange rate for the period. We include translation adjustments from currency exchange and the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions of a
long-term investment nature as a separate component of shareholders equity. We report gains and losses from currency exchange rate changes related to intercompany receivables and payables that are not of a long-term investment nature, as well
as gains and losses from non-U.S. currency transactions, currently in operating costs and expenses, and those amounted to a loss of $7 million in 2010, a loss of less than $1 million in 2009, and a $6 million loss in 2008. Gains and other income for
2010 included $2 million attributable to currency translation adjustment losses, net of gains, from the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of investments. There were no similar gains or losses in 2008 and 2009. 
Legal Contingencies We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We record an accrual for legal contingencies when we determine that it is probable
that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In making such determinations we evaluate, among other things, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and, when it is probable that a liability
has been incurred, our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the loss. We review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. 
Income Taxes We record the amounts of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, as well as deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that we have recognized in our financial
statements or tax returns. We use judgment in assessing future profitability and the likely future tax consequences of events that we have recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We base our estimates of deferred tax assets and
liabilities on current tax laws, rates and interpretations, and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. We develop our estimates of future profitability and based on our historical data and experience,
industry projections, micro and macro general economic condition projections, and our expectations. Changes
in existing tax laws and rates, their related interpretations, as well as the uncertainty generated by the current economic environment may affect the amounts of deferred tax liabilities or the valuations of deferred tax assets over time. Our
accounting for deferred tax consequences represents managements best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates. 
For tax positions we have taken or expect to take in a tax return, we apply a more likely than not threshold, under which
we must conclude a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, assuming that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, in order to continue to recognize the
benefit. In determining our provision for income taxes, we use judgment, reflecting our estimates and assumptions, in applying the more likely than not threshold.

New Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation Standards 
On the first day of 2010, we adopted ASU No2009-16, which amended Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing,
by: 1eliminating the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity QSPE; 2clarifying and amending the criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale; 3amending and clarifying the unit of account eligible
for sale accounting; and 4requiring that a transferor initially measure at fair value and recognize all assets obtained for example beneficial interests and liabilities incurred as a result of a transfer of an entire financial asset or
group of financial assets accounted for as a sale. In addition, this topic requires us to evaluate entities for consolidation that had been treated as QSPEs under previous accounting guidance. The topic also mandates that we supplement our
disclosures about, among other things, our continuing involvement with transfers of financial assets previously accounted for as sales, the inherent risks in our retained financial assets, and the nature and financial effect of restrictions on the
assets that we continue to report in our Balance Sheet. We also adopted ASU No2009-17 on the first day
of 2010, which changed the consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entities VIEs. This topic also amended the guidance on determination of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, and is, therefore,
required to consolidate an entity, by requiring a qualitative, rather than the prior quantitative, analysis of the VIE. The new qualitative analysis includes, among other things, consideration of who has the power to direct those activities that
most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. This topic also mandates that an enterprise
continually reassess whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, in contrast to the prior standard that required the primary beneficiary only be reassessed when specific events occurred. This topic now also expressly applies to QSPEs, which were
previously exempt, and requires additional disclosures about an enterprises involvement with a VIE. Accounting
Standards Update No2009-13 Revenue Recognition Topic 605: Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements ASU No2009-13 We adopted ASU No2009-13 in the 2010 third quarter as required by the guidance and applied it retrospectively to the first day of 2010. ASU No2009-13 addresses the accounting for
multiple-deliverable arrangements complex contracts or related contracts that require the separate delivery of multiple goods and/or services by expanding the circumstances in which vendors may account for deliverables separately rather than as a
combined unit. This update clarifies the guidance on how to separate such deliverables and how to measure and allocate consideration for these arrangements to one or more units of accounting. The previous guidance required a vendor to use
vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price to separate deliverables in multiple-deliverable arrangements. In addition to retaining this guidance, in situations where vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party
evidence is not available, ASU No2009-13 requires a vendor to allocate arrangement consideration to each deliverable in multiple-deliverable arrangements based on each deliverables relative selling price. Our adoption did not have a
material impact on our financial statements, and we do not expect it will have a material effect on our financial statements in future periods. Accounting Standards Update No2010-06 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic 820: Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements ASU No2010-06
We adopted certain provisions of ASU No2010-06 in the 2010 first quarter. Those provisions amended
Subtopic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Overall, by requiring additional disclosures for transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, as well as requiring fair value measurement disclosures
for each class of assets and liabilities, a subset of the captions in our Balance Sheets. Our adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements or disclosures, as we had no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair
value measurements and no material classes of assets and liabilities that required additional disclosure. See Future Adoption of Accounting Standards for the provisions of this topic that apply to future periods. 
Accounting Standards Update No2010-09 Subsequent Events Topic 855: Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure
Requirements ASU No2010-09 We adopted ASU No2010-09 in the 2010 first
quarter. ASU No2010-09 amended Subtopic 855-10, Subsequent Events Overall, by removing the requirement for a United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC registrant to disclose a date, in both issued
and revised financial statements, through which that filer had evaluated subsequent events. Accordingly, we removed the related disclosure from the Basis of Presentation caption of Footnote
78 Table of Contents
No1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Our adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements. 
Accounting Standards Update No2010-20 Receivables Topic 310: Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing
Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses ASU No2010-20 We adopted ASU
No2010-20 in the 2010 fourth quarter. ASU No2010-20 amends existing guidance by requiring more robust and disaggregated disclosures by an entity about the credit quality of its financing receivables and its allowance for credit losses.
These disclosures provide financial statement users with additional information about the nature of credit risks inherent in our financing receivables, how we analyze and assess credit risk in determining our allowance for credit losses, and the
reasons for any changes we may make in our allowance for credit losses. Our adoption of this update primarily resulted in increased notes receivable disclosures see Footnote No11, Notes Receivable, but did not have any other
impact on our financial statements. Future Adoption of Accounting Standards 
ASU No2010-06 Provisions Effective in the 2011 First Quarter 
Certain provisions of ASU No2010-06 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2010, which
for us will be our 2011 first quarter. Those provisions, which amended Subtopic 820-10, will require us to present as separate line items all purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements of financial instruments valued using significant unobservable
inputs Level 3 in the reconciliation of fair value measurements, in contrast to the current aggregate presentation as a single line item. Although this may change the appearance of our fair value reconciliations, we do not believe the adoption
will have a material impact on our financial statements or disclosures.  2.
INCOME TAXES Our provision for/benefit from income taxes consists of:  in millions
2010 2009 2008 Current -U.S. Federal 117 169 275 -U.S. State 7 12 40 -Non-U.S. 51 61 85 59 242 400 Deferred -U.S. Federal 150 234 7 -U.S. State 14 28 8 -Non-U.S. 12 45 35 152 307 50 93 65 350 Our current tax provision does not reflect the benefits costs attributable to us for the
exercise or vesting of employee share-based awards of $51 million in 2010, $8 million in 2009, and $21 million in 2008. The preceding table includes tax credits of $2 million in 2010, $2 million in 2009, and $9 million in 2008. The taxes
applicable to other comprehensive income are not material. We have made no provision for U.S. income taxes or
additional non-U.S. taxes on the cumulative unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries $861 million as of year-end 2010 because we consider these earnings to be permanently invested. These earnings could become subject to additional taxes if
remitted as dividends, loaned to us or a U.S. affiliate or if we sold our interests in the affiliates. We cannot practically estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on the unremitted earnings. 
We conduct business in countries that grant holidays from income taxes for 5- to 30- year periods. These
holidays expire through 2034. Without these tax holidays, we would have incurred the following aggregate income taxes and related earnings per share impacts: $7 million $002 per diluted share in 2010; $4 million $001 per diluted
share in 2009; and $11 million $003 per diluted share in 2008. We file income tax returns, including
returns for our subsidiaries, in various jurisdictions around the world. We filed an Internal Revenue Service IRS refund claim relating to 2000 and 2001 for certain software development costs. The IRS disallowed the claims, and in July
2009, we protested the disallowance. This issue is pending in the IRS Appeals Division. In the 2010 fourth
quarter, we reached a settlement with the IRS Appeals Division resolving all issues that arose in the audit of tax years 2005 through 2008. This settlement resulted in an $85 million decrease in our tax expense for 2010 due
79 Table of Contents
to the release of tax liabilities we had previously established for the treatment of funds we received from non-U.S. subsidiaries. Additionally, our 2010 income tax expense reflected a $12
million benefit we recorded primarily associated with revisions to estimates of prior years foreign income tax expenses. In 2009 and 2008, we recorded an income tax expense of $52 million and $24 million, respectively, primarily related to the treatment of funds received from non-U.S. subsidiaries. This issue has been
settled as noted above. In addition, we recorded a $19 million tax expense in 2008 due primarily to prior years tax adjustments, including a settlement with the IRS that resulted in a lower than expected refund of taxes associated with a 1995
leasing transaction. The settlement resulted in a $26 million tax refund, which we received during 2008. In 2008 we also recorded a $29 million income tax expense primarily related to an unfavorable U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision involving a
refund claim associated with a 1994 tax planning transaction. The tax had been paid, and the issue is now closed. With the exception of the refund claim for 2000 and 2001, the IRS has examined our federal income tax returns, and we have settled all issues for tax years through 2008. We participated in the IRS
Compliance Assurance Program CAP for the 2010 and 2009 tax years and also expect to participate for 2011. This program accelerates the examination of key transactions with the goal of resolving any issues before the tax return is
filed. Various income tax returns are also under examination by foreign, state and local taxing authorities. 
Our total unrecognized tax benefits were $39 million at year-end 2010, $249 million at year-end 2009, and $141 million at
year-end 2008. Our unrecognized tax benefit reflects the following 2010, 2009, and 2008 changes: in 2010 a decrease of $210 million, primarily reflecting the settlement with IRS Appeals of the 2005-2008 tax years; in 2009 an increase of $108

subsidiaries as well as a 1994 tax planning transaction issue and a decrease of $88 million, primarily representing the settlement of a 1995 leasing transaction. 
As a large taxpayer, we are under continual audit by the IRS and other taxing authorities. Although we do not anticipate
that a significant impact to our unrecognized tax benefit balance will occur during the next 52 weeks as a result of these audits, it remains possible that the amount of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change over that time period.
Our unrecognized tax benefit balances included $26 million at year-end 2010, $136 million at year-end 2009,
and $87 million at year-end 2008 of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate. 
The following table reconciles our unrecognized tax benefit balance for each year from the beginning of 2008 to the end
of 2010:  in millions

related to our unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Related interest expense totaled $2 million in 2010, $2 million in 2009, and $42 million in 2008. Accrued interest expense totaled $4 million in 2010, $28 million in 2009 and
$29 million in 2008. Deferred Income Taxes 
Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities and their tax bases, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We state those balances at the enacted tax rates we expect will be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Deferred income tax assets
80 Table of Contents
represent amounts available to reduce income taxes we will pay on taxable income in future years. We evaluate our ability to realize these future tax deductions and credits by assessing whether
we expect to have sufficient future taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies to utilize these future deductions and credits. We
establish a valuation allowance when we no longer consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized. Total deferred tax assets and liabilities as of year-end 2010 and year-end 2009, were as follows:  in millions

At year-end 2010, we had approximately $16 million of tax credits that expire through 2030
and $219 million of tax credits that do not expire. We claimed approximately $6 million of tax credits in 2008 treating them as a reduction of 2008 Federal and state income taxes associated with investment tax credits that arose in 2008. We
accounted for these credits using the flow-through method. We recorded $21 million of net operating loss benefits in 2010 and $33 million in 2009. At year-end 2010, we had approximately $11 billion of net operating losses, of which $573 million
expire through 2030.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS-SYNTHETIC FUEL Prior to 2008 we operated four coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities. Because tax credits under Section45K of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code IRC were not available for
coal-based synthetic fuel produced or sold after calendar year-end 2007, we shut down the Facilities and permanently ceased production of synthetic fuel in late 2007. Accordingly, we now report this business as a discontinued operation. 
The following tables provide additional income statement information relating to our discontinued synthetic fuel
operations. The discontinued synthetic fuel operations reflected in our 2008 Income Statement only represent activity related to Marriott and there were no noncontrolling interests.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Under our 2002 Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan the Comprehensive Plan, we award: 1stock options to purchase our ClassA Common Stock Stock Option
Program; 2stock appreciation rights SARs for our ClassA Common Stock SAR Program; 3restricted stock units RSUs of our ClassA Common Stock; and 4deferred stock
units. We grant awards at exercise prices or strike prices that are equal to the market price of our ClassA Common Stock on the date of grant. For all share-based awards, the guidance requires that we measure compensation costs related to our share-based payment transactions at fair value on the grant date and that we recognize those costs in
the financial statements over the vesting period during which the employee provides service in exchange for the award. During 2010, we granted 38million RSUs, 11million Employee SARs, 0 Non-employee SARs, and 34,000 deferred stock units. 
We recorded share-based compensation expense related to award grants of $91 million in 2010, $85 million in 2009, and
$112 million in 2008. Deferred compensation costs related to unvested awards totaled $113 million at year-end 2010 and $122 million at year-end 2009. As of year-end 2010, we expect that these deferred compensation expenses will be recognized over a
weighted average period of two years. 
82 Table of Contents
For awards granted after 2005, we recognize share-based compensation expense
over the period from the grant date to the date on which the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service the substantive vesting period. We continue to follow the stated vesting period for the unvested
portion of awards granted prior to 2006 and the adoption of the current guidance for share-based compensation and follow the substantive vesting period for awards granted after 2005. 
In accordance with the guidance for share-based compensation, we present the tax benefits and costs resulting from the
exercise or vesting of share-based awards as financing cash flows. The exercise of share-based awards in 2010, 2009 and 2008 resulted in tax benefits of $51 million in 2010, tax costs of $8 million in 2009, and tax benefits of $21 million in 2008.
We received $147 million in 2010, $35 million in 2009, and $30 million in 2008 in cash from the exercise of
stock options granted under share-based payment arrangements. RSUs 
We issue RSUs under the Comprehensive Plan to certain officers and key employees and those units vest generally over four
years in annual installments commencing one year after the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for the RSUs over the service period equal to the fair market value of the stock units on the date of issuance. Upon vesting, RSUs convert to
shares and are distributed from treasury shares. At year-end 2010 and year-end 2009, we had approximately $103 million and $109 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related to RSUs. The weighted average remaining term for RSU grants
outstanding at year-end 2010 was two years. The following table provides additional information on RSUs for
the last three fiscal years:  2010 2009 2008 Share-based compensation expense in millions 76 71 85 Weighted average grant-date fair value per share 27 19 30 Aggregate intrinsic value of converted and distributed in millions 95 39 90

We may grant employee stock options to officers and key employees at exercise prices or strike prices equal to the market
price of our ClassA Common Stock on the date of grant. Non-qualified options generally expire ten years after the date of grant, except those issued from 1990 through 2000, which expire 15 years after the date of the grant. Most stock options
under the Stock Option Program are exercisable in cumulative installments of one quarter at the end of each of the first four years following the date of grant. 
We recognized compensation expense associated with employee stock options of less than $1 million in 2010, $1 million in
2009, and $6 million in 2008. We had approximately $1 million in deferred compensation costs related to employee stock options at both year-end 2010 and year-end 2009. Upon the exercise of stock options, we issue shares from treasury shares.

The
total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2010, 2009, and 2008 was approximately $149 million, $30 million, and $42 million, respectively. We may grant SARs to officers and key employees at exercise prices or strike prices equal to the market price of our ClassA Common Stock on the date of grant. SARs generally expire ten years after
the date of grant and both vest and may be exercised in cumulative installments of one quarter at the end of each of the first four years following the date of grant. We may grant Non-employee SARs to directors at exercise prices or strike prices
equal to the market price of our ClassA Common Stock on the date of grant. Non-employee SARs generally expire ten years after the date of grant and vest upon grant; however, they are generally not exercisable until one year after grant. On
exercise of SARs, employees or Non-employee directors receive the number of shares of ClassA Common Stock equal to the number of SARs that are being exercised multiplied by the quotient of athe final value minus the base value, divided
by bthe final value. We recognized compensation expense associated with Employee SARs and
Non-employee SARs of $12 million in 2010, $11 million in 2009, and $18 million in 2008. At year-end 2010 and year-end 2009, we had approximately $9 million and $11 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related to SARs. Upon the
exercise of SARs, we issue shares from treasury shares. The following table shows the 2010 changes in our outstanding SARs:  NumberofSARsin

The
number of SARs forfeited in 2010 and 2009 was 79,000 and 22,000, respectively. Outstanding SARs had a total intrinsic value of $54 million at year-end 2010 and zero at year-end 2009, and exercisable SARs had a total intrinsic value of $13 million at
year-end 2010 and zero at year-end 2009. SARs exercised during 2010 had a total intrinsic value of $402,000. No SARs were exercised in 2009 or 2008. We use a binomial method to estimate the fair value of each stock option or SAR granted, under which we calculate the weighted average expected stock option or SARs as the product of a lattice-based
binomial valuation model that uses suboptimal exercise factors. We use historical data to estimate exercise behaviors for separate groups of retirement eligible and non-retirement eligible employees. The following table shows the assumptions we used
for stock options and employee SARs for 2010, 2009, and 2008:  2010 2009 2008 Expected volatility 32 32 29 Dividend yield 071 095 080-095 Risk-free rate 33 22 34-39 Expected term in years 70 70 69
In
making these assumptions, we based risk-free rates on the corresponding U.S. Treasury spot rates for the expected duration at the date of grant, which we converted to a continuously compounded rate. We based expected volatility on the
weighted-average historical volatility, with periods with atypical stock movement given a lower weight to reflect stabilized long-term mean volatility. We generally valued non-employee SARs using assumptions consistent with those shown above for
Employee SARs, except that we used an expected term of ten years and risk-free rates of 32 percent and 39 percent for 2009 and 2008, respectively, rather than those shown in the foregoing table. 
Deferred Stock Units We also issue deferred stock units to Non-employee directors. These Non-employee director deferred stock units vest within one year and are distributed upon election. At year-end 2010 and year-end 2009,
there was approximately $313,000 and $228,000, respectively, in deferred costs related to Non-employee director deferred stock units. The following table shows share-based compensation expense, number of deferred stock units granted, weighted average grant-date fair value, and aggregate intrinsic value of Non-employee director deferred
stock units:  2010 2009 2008 Share-based compensation expense 932,000 715,000 684,000 Non-employee director deferred stock units granted 34,000 39,000 25,000 Weighted average grant-date fair value per share 35 23 33 Aggregate intrinsic value in millions 12 05 04
At
year-end 2010 and year-end 2009, 252,000 and 249,000, respectively, of Non-employee deferred stock units were outstanding. The weighted average grant-date fair value of those outstanding deferred stock units was $26 for 2010 and $24 for 2009.

Other Information 
Although the Comprehensive Plan also provides for issuance of deferred stock bonus awards, deferred stock awards, and
restricted stock awards, our Compensation Policy Committee indefinitely suspended the issuance of deferred bonus stock beginning in 2001 and the issuance of both deferred stock awards and restricted stock awards beginning in 2003. At year-end 2010
and year-end 2009, we had less than $1 million and $1 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related to these suspended award programs, and at year-end 2010 the weighted average remaining term for outstanding awards granted under
those suspended programs was one year. We had share-based compensation expense associated with these suspended award programs of $1 million in 2010, $1 million in 2009, and $2 million in 2008. 
At year-end 2010, we reserved 58million shares under the Comprehensive Plan, including 29million shares under
the Stock Option Program and the SAR Program.  5.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We believe that the fair values of our current assets and current liabilities approximate their reported carrying amounts. The following table shows the carrying values and the fair values of non-current
financial assets and liabilities that qualify as financial instruments, determined in accordance with current guidance for disclosures on the fair value of financial instruments. AtYear-End2010 At Year-End 2009 in millions

portion of our non-securitized long-term loans to timeshare owners using a discounted cash flow model. We believe this is comparable to the model that an independent third party would use in the current market. Our model uses default rates,
prepayment rates, coupon rates and loan terms for our sold note portfolio as key drivers of risk and relative value, that when applied in combination with pricing parameters, determines the fair value of the underlying notes receivable. We value
certain non-securitized loans to timeshare owners at their carrying value, rather than using our pricing model. We believe that the carrying value of such loans approximates fair value because the stated interest rates of these loans are consistent
with current market rates and the reserve for these loans appropriately accounts for risks in default rates, prepayment rates, and loan terms. We estimate the fair value of our senior, mezzanine, and other loans by discounting cash flows using risk-adjusted rates. 
We estimate the fair value of our cost method investments by applying a cap rate to stabilized earnings a market
approach. The carrying value of our restricted cash approximates its fair value. We estimate the fair value
of our non-recourse debt associated with securitized loans to timeshare owners by obtaining indicative bids from investment banks that actively issue and facilitate the secondary market for timeshare securities. As an additional measure, we
internally generate cash flow estimates by modeling all bond tranches for our active securitization transactions, with consideration for the collateral specific to each tranche. The key drivers in our analysis include default rates, prepayment
rates, bond interest rates and other structural factors, which we use to estimate the projected cash flows. In order to estimate market credit spreads by rating, we reviewed market spreads from timeshare note securitizations and other asset-backed
transactions that occurred during 2010 and 2009. We then applied those estimated market spreads to swap rates in order to estimate an underlying discount rate for calculating the fair value of the active bonds. We concluded
86 Table of Contents
that the fair value of the bonds reflects a marginal premium over the book value resulting from relatively low current swap rates and credit spreads. 
We estimate the fair value of our other long-term debt, excluding leases, using expected future payments discounted at
risk-adjusted rates, and we determine the fair value of our senior notes using quoted market prices. At year-end 2009, the carrying value of our credit facility approximated its fair value due to the short maturity dates of the draws we had executed
we had no outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility at year-end 2010. Other long-term liabilities represent guarantee costs and reserves and deposit liabilities. The carrying values of our guarantee costs and reserves approximate their fair
values. We estimate the fair value of our deposit liabilities primarily by discounting future payments at a risk-adjusted rate. We are required to carry our marketable securities at fair value. The carrying value of our marketable securities at year-end 2010 was $18 million, which included debt securities of the U.S. Government,
its sponsored agencies and other U.S. corporations invested for our self-insurance programs. We value these securities using directly observable Level 1 inputs as described in Footnote No1, Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies. We are also required to carry our derivative assets and liabilities at fair value. As of
year-end 2010, we had derivative instruments in a current liability position of $1 million valued using Level 1 inputs and $1 million in a long-term liability position valued using Level 3 inputs. We value our Level 3 input derivatives using
valuations that we calibrate to the initial trade prices, with subsequent valuations based on unobservable inputs to the valuation model, including interest rates and volatilities. 
See Footnote No1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information on Timeshare
Segment residual interests that we eliminated as part of our adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards in the first quarter of 2010. The preceding table includes the carrying amounts and estimated fair values for
the long-term portion of the securitized notes receivable we reestablished and the associated debt obligations we recorded as part of this adoption.  6.

Effect of dilutive securities 
87 Table of Contents
caption in the preceding table, because it would have been antidilutive to do so: 75million employee stock option and SARs plan shares, 14million deferred stock incentive plans
shares, or 21million RSU shares. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for calculating
earnings per share, we have not included the following stock options and SARs in our calculation of diluted earnings per share attributable to Marriott shareholders because the exercise prices were greater than the average market prices for the
applicable periods:  a
for 2010, 24million options and SARs, with exercise prices ranging from $3411 to $4903; b
for 2009, 123million options and SARs, with exercise prices ranging from $2230 to $4903; and c
for 2008, 39million options and SARs, with exercise prices ranging from $3105 to $4903. 7.
INVENTORY 
Inventory, totaling $1,489 million as of year-end 2010 and $1,444 million as of year-end 2009, consists primarily of
Timeshare segment interval, fractional ownership, and residential products totaling $1,472 million as of year-end 2010 and $1,426 million as of year-end 2009. Inventory totaling $17 million as of year-end 2010 and $18 million as of year-end 2009,
primarily relates to hotel operating supplies for the limited number of properties we own or lease. We primarily value Timeshare segment interval, fractional ownership, and residential products at the lower of cost or fair market value, in
accordance with applicable accounting guidance, and we generally value operating supplies at the lower of cost using the first-in, first-out method or market. Consistent with recognized industry practice, we classify Timeshare segment interval,
fractional ownership, and residential products inventory, which has an operating cycle that exceeds 12 months, as a current asset. Weak economic conditions in the United States, Europe and much of the rest of the world, instability in the financial markets following the 2008 worldwide financial crisis, and weak consumer confidence
all contributed to a difficult business environment and resulted in weaker demand for our Timeshare segment products, in particular our luxury residential or whole ownership products, but also to a lesser extent our luxury fractional ownership and
timeshare products. Accordingly, in 2009, we recorded an inventory impairment charge of $529 million in conjunction with our evaluation of the entire Timeshare portfolio. See Footnote No18, Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges, for
additional information. The following table shows the composition of our Timeshare segment inventory balances:

and equipment when incurred. These capitalized costs may include structural costs, equipment, fixtures, floor, and wall coverings. We expense all repair and maintenance costs as incurred. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets three to 40 years, and we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the asset life or lease term. Depreciation expense totaled $138 million in 2010, $151 million in 2009, and $155 million in 2008.

In the 2010 fourth quarter, we determined that we would not be able to fully
recover the carrying amount of a capitalized software asset from an existing group of property owners. In accordance with the guidance for the impairment of long-lived assets, we evaluated the asset for recovery and as a result of a negotiated
agreement with the property owners, in 2010 we recorded an impairment charge of $84 million to adjust the carrying value of the asset to our estimate of its fair value. We estimated that fair value using an income approach reflecting internally
developed Level 3 discounted cash flows that included, among other things, our expectations of future cash flows based on historical experience and projected growth rates, usage estimates and demand trends. The impairment charge impacted the
general, administrative, and other expense line in our Income Statement. We did not allocate that charge to any of our segments. In the 2010 fourth quarter, we decided to pursue the disposition of a golf course and related assets from our Timeshare segment. In accordance with the guidance for the impairment of long-lived assets, we
evaluated the property and related assets for recovery and in 2010 we recorded an impairment charge of $13 million to adjust the carrying value of the assets to our estimate of fair value. We estimated that fair value using an income approach
reflecting internally developed Level 3 discounted cash flows based on negotiations with a qualified prospective third-party purchaser of the asset. The impairment charge impacted the general, administrative, and other expense line in our Income
Statement, and we allocated the charge to our Timeshare segment. In the 2010 fourth quarter, we decided to
pursue the disposition of a land parcel. In accordance with the guidance for the impairment of long-lived assets, we evaluated the property for recovery and subsequently in 2010 we recorded an impairment charge of $14 million to adjust the carrying
value of the property to our estimate of fair value. We estimated that fair value using an income approach reflecting internally developed Level 3 cash flows that included, among other things, our expectations about the eventual disposition of the
property based on discussions with potential third-party purchasers. The impairment charge impacted the general, administrative, and other expense line in our Income Statement, and we allocated that charge to our North American Limited-Service
segment.  9.
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS 2010 Acquisitions In 2010, we acquired one land parcel for
hotel development and one hotel for cash consideration of $175 million. We also acquired timeshare and fractional units for use in The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club program for cash consideration of $112 million, which included a deposit of $11
million, paid in 2009. 2010 Dispositions 
In 2010, we sold two limited-service properties, one full-service property, and one land parcel for cash proceeds of $114
million and recorded a net gain of $27 million. We accounted for each of the sales under the full accrual method in accordance with accounting for sales of real estate. We will continue to operate the full-service property and one of the
limited-service properties under management agreements. The other limited-service property left our system. 2009
Acquisitions and Dispositions We made no significant acquisitions or dispositions in 2009. 
2008 Acquisitions At year-end 2007, we were party to a venture that developed and marketed fractional ownership and residential products. In 2008, we purchased our partners interest in that joint venture together
with additional land. Cash consideration for this transaction totaled $42 million and we acquired assets and liabilities totaling $80 million and $38 million, respectively, on the date of purchase. In 2008, we also purchased real estate for a
timeshare project for a total purchase price of approximately $63 million. Cash consideration totaled approximately $39 million, and non-current liabilities recorded as a result of this transaction were $24 million. In addition, in 2008, we
purchased real estate for another timeshare project for cash consideration of $47 million. Also in 2008, we purchased units in an existing building for our timeshare operations for cash consideration of approximately $14 million. We also purchased
real estate for another timeshare project for $28 million. Cash consideration totaled approximately $27 million, and we acquired assets and liabilities totaling $28 million and $1 million, respectively, on the date of purchase. 
2008 Dispositions In 2008, we sold, at book value, two limited-service properties and two land parcels for cash proceeds of $33 million, and we received a $22 million equity interest in the entity that purchased one of the
land parcels. We accounted for each of the sales under the full accrual method in accordance with accounting for sales of real estate and each property will continue to operate under our brands pursuant to management or franchise agreements. Also,
in 2008, we sold our interest in an entity

Senior, Mezzanine, and Other Loans We reflect interest income associated with Senior, mezzanine, and other loans in the Interest income caption in our Income Statements. At year-end 2010, our recorded investment in
impaired Senior, mezzanine, and other loans was $83 million. We do not accrue interest on impaired loans, but instead recognize interest on a cash basis. We had a $74 million notes receivable reserve representing an allowance for credit
losses, leaving $9 million of our investment in impaired loans, for which we had no related allowance for credit losses. At year-end 2009, our recorded investment in impaired Senior, mezzanine, and other loans was $191 million, and we
had a $183 million notes receivable reserve representing an allowance for credit losses, leaving $8 million of our investment in impaired loans, for which we had no related allowance for credit losses. During 2010 and 2009, our average investment in
impaired loans totaled $137 million and $174 million, respectively.

Timeshare sales and services revenue caption. Of the $187 million of interest income we recognized from these loans in 2010, $147 million was associated with securitized loans and $40 million was associated with non-securitized loans,
while the interest income recognized in 2009 and 2008 related solely to non-securitized loans. The following

The non-securitized notes receivable reserve relates to the implementation of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards, which
required us to establish reserves for certain previously securitized and subsequently repurchased notes held at January2, 2010. 2
Decrease in securitized reserve and increase in non-securitized reserve was attributable to the transfer of the reserve when we repurchased the notes. 3

ASSET SECURITIZATIONS We periodically securitize, without recourse, through special purpose entities, notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional
products. We continue to service the notes and transfer all proceeds collected to special purpose entities. We retain servicing agreements and other interests in the notes. The executed transactions typically include minimal cash reserves
established at time of securitization as well as default and delinquency triggers, which we monitor on a monthly basis. As a result of our adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards, we no longer account for note
receivable securitizations as sales, but rather as secured borrowings as defined in these topics, and therefore, we did not recognize gains or losses on the 2010 note securitization, nor do we expect to recognize gains or losses on future note
receivable securitizations. See Footnote No1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information on the impact of our 2010 first quarter adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation
standards on our timeshare note securitizations, including the elimination of residual interests. The
following table shows cash flows between us and investors during 2009 and 2008. In 2010 we consolidated the entities that facilitate our notes receivable securitizations. See Footnote No20, Variable Interest Entities, for

in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional ownership products of $229 million, $446 million and $300 million, respectively. During 2010, we entered into one note securitization transaction for $229 million. The note
securitization was made to a newly formed transaction-specific trust that, simultaneously with its purchase of the notes receivable, issued $218 million of the trusts notes. During 2009, we entered into two note securitization transactions for
$284 million and $380 million. The second of these transactions included our reacquisition and securitization of $218 million of notes that were previously securitized in the first transaction. Each note securitization in 2009 and 2008 was made to a
newly formed transaction-specific trust that, simultaneously with its purchase of the notes receivable, issued $522 million and $246 million respectively, of the trusts notes. In connection with the securitization of the notes receivable, we
received proceeds, net of costs and reserves, of $215 million in 2010, $349 million in 2009 and $237 million in 2008. We have included gains from the sales of timeshare notes receivable totaling $37 million in 2009 and $16 million, net of $12
million of hedge ineffectiveness, in 2008 in the Timeshare sales and services revenue caption in our Income Statements.

LONG-TERM DEBT As discussed in Footnote No1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, on the first day of 2010, we consolidated certain previously unconsolidated entities associated with past
timeshare notes receivable securitization transactions and later in 2010 we consolidated the special purpose entity associated with our 2010 securitization, resulting in consolidation of the related debt obligations. We securitize notes receivable
through bankruptcy-remote entities, and the entities creditors have no recourse to us. The following
table provides detail on our long-term debt balances:  in millions

The non-recourse debt associated with securitized notes receivable was, and to the extent currently outstanding is,
secured by the related notes receivable. All of our other long-term debt was, and to the extent currently outstanding is, recourse to us but unsecured. We are party to a multicurrency revolving credit agreement the Credit Facility that provides for $2404 billion of aggregate effective borrowings all of which was available at year-end
2010 to support general corporate needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, and letters of credit. The Credit Facility expires on May14, 2012. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered
Rate LIBOR plus a fixed spread. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. While borrowings under our Credit Facility generally have short-term maturities, we classify outstanding borrowings as
long-term based on our ability and intent to refinance the outstanding borrowings on a long-term basis. Each
of our securitized notes receivable pools contains various triggers relating to the performance of the underlying notes receivable. If a pool of securitized notes receivable fails to perform within the pools established parameters default or
delinquency thresholds vary by deal transaction provisions effectively redirect the monthly excess spread we typically receive from that pool related to the interests we retained to accelerate the principal payments to investors based on the
subordination of the different tranches until the performance trigger is cured. In 2010, seven of our securitized notes receivable pools reached performance triggers in different months throughout the year as a result of increased defaults. As of
year-end 2010, of the seven pools out of compliance during 2010, loan performance had improved sufficiently in six pools to cure the performance triggers, leaving one pool out of compliance. For 2010, 2009 and 2008 approximately $6 million, $17
million, and $0, respectively, of cash flows were redirected as a result of reaching the performance triggers for those years. At year-end 2010, we had 13 securitized notes receivable pools outstanding.

the Cash Requirements and Our Credit Facilities discussion in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this report for additional information regarding our Credit Facility. 
In 2009, we repurchased $122 million principal amount of our Senior Notes in the open market, across multiple series. We
recorded a gain of $21 million for the debt extinguishment representing the difference between the acquired debts purchase price of $98 million and its carrying amount of $119 million. The weighted average interest rate on the senior debt that
was paid down in 2009 was 68 percent. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we made a $79 million cash payment of
principal and interest to retire, at maturity, all of our outstanding Series C Senior Notes. We did not
repurchase or retire any of our Senior Notes in 2010. We paid cash for interest, net of amounts capitalized,
of $148 million in 2010, $96 million in 2009, and $110 million in 2008.  14.

The provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses decreased by $8
million in 2010 and $6 million in 2009 as a result of changes in estimates from insured events of the prior years due to changes in underwriting experience and frequency and severity trends. Our year-end 2010 self-insurance reserve of $313 million
consisted of a current portion of $98 million and long-term portion of $215 million. Our year-end 2009 self-insurance reserve of $304 million consisted of a current portion of $96 million and long-term portion of $208 million. 15.
SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY Eight hundred million shares of our ClassA Common Stock, with a par value of $01 per share, and ten million shares of preferred stock, without par value, are authorized under our restated
certificate of incorporation. As of year-end 2010, of those authorized shares 3669million shares of our ClassA Common Stock and no shares of our preferred stock were outstanding. 
Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $2 million at year-end 2010 consisted of losses totaling $4 million associated
with currency translation adjustments, and gains of $2 million associated with interest rate swap agreement cash flow hedges. Accumulated other comprehensive income of $13 million at year-end 2009 consisted of gains totaling $11 million associated
with currency translation adjustments, and gains of $2 million associated with interest rate swap agreement cash flow hedges.  16.
CONTINGENCIES 
Guarantees We issue guarantees to certain lenders and hotel owners, primarily to obtain long-term management contracts. The guarantees generally have a stated maximum amount of funding and a term of three to ten
years. The terms of guarantees to lenders generally require us to fund if cash flows from hotel operations are inadequate to cover annual debt service or to repay the loan at the end of the term. The terms of guarantees to hotel owners generally
require us to fund if the hotels do not attain specified levels of operating profit. We are generally entitled to recover guarantee fundings to lenders and hotel owners as loans repayable to us out of future hotel cash flows and/or proceeds from the
sale of hotels. We also enter into project completion guarantees with certain lenders in conjunction with hotels and Timeshare segment properties that we or our joint venture partners are building. 
The following table shows the maximum potential amount of future fundings for guarantees where we are the primary obligor
and the carrying amount of the liability for expected future fundings.  $ in millions

Sheet as follows: $5 million in the Other current liabilities line item and $26 million in the Other long-term liabilities line item. Our guarantees listed in the preceding table include $32 million of operating profit guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying properties open and we begin to operate the properties.
The guarantees in the preceding table do not include the following:  $133 million of guarantees related to Senior Living Services lease obligations of $87 million expiring in 2013 and lifecare bonds of $46 million
estimated to expire in 2016, for which we are secondarily liable. The primary obligors on these liabilities are Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. Sunrise on both the leases and $7 million of the lifecare bonds; CNL Retirement Properties,
Inc. CNL, which subsequently merged with Health Care Property Investors, Inc., on $38 million of the lifecare bonds; and Five Star Senior Living on the remaining $1 million of lifecare bonds. Prior to our sale of the Senior Living
Services business in 2003, these were guarantees by us of obligations of consolidated Senior Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise and CNL have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called upon to make in connection with these lease
obligations and lifecare bonds. While we currently do not expect to fund under the guarantees, Sunrises SEC 
96 Table of Contents 
filings suggest that Sunrises continued ability to meet these guarantee obligations cannot be assured given Sunrises financial position and limited access to liquidity.
Lease obligations, for which we became secondarily liable when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997, consisting of annual rent payments
of approximately $6 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term of approximately $52 million. Most of these obligations expire by the end of 2020. CTF Holdings Ltd. CTF had originally made available
35million in cash collateral in the event that we are required to fund under such guarantees, approximately 6million $8 million of which remained at year-end 2010. Our exposure for the remaining rent payments through the
initial term will decline to the extent that CTF obtains releases from the landlords or these hotels exit the system. Since the time we assumed these guarantees, we have not funded any amounts, and we do not expect to fund any amounts under these
guarantees in the future.  A project completion guarantee to a lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $592 million. We are liable on a several basis with
our partners in an amount equal to our 34 percent pro rata ownership in the joint venture. The carrying value of our liability associated with this guarantee was $16 million at year-end 2010, as further discussed in Footnote No20,
Variable Interest Entities.  A project completion guarantee that we provided to another lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of Canadian $491 million $491
million. The associated joint venture will satisfy payments for cost overruns for this project through contributions from the partners or from borrowings, and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our 20 percent
pro rata ownership in the joint venture. During the third quarter of 2010, our joint venture partners executed documents indemnifying us for any payments that may be required in connection with this guarantee obligation. The carrying value of our
liability associated with this project completion guarantee was $3 million at year-end 2010. 
In addition to the guarantees described in the preceding paragraphs, in conjunction with financing obtained for specific
projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability, or damage occurring as a result of the actions of the other joint venture owner or our own
actions. Commitments and Letters of Credit 
In addition to the guarantees noted in the preceding paragraphs, as of year-end 2010, we had the following commitments
outstanding:  A commitment, subject to certain conditions, to invest up to 41million $54 million to acquire 50 percent interests in two new joint
ventures for the operation, management and development of hotels, initially in Europe but eventually in other parts of the world; to purchase related intellectual property; and to fund property improvements at some hotels. The hotels will be managed
by the joint ventures or franchised at the direction of the joint ventures. We expect to fund this commitment during the first or second quarter of 2011. We also have a right and under certain circumstances an obligation to acquire the remaining
interest in the joint ventures over the next ten years.  A commitment, subject to certain conditions, to acquire a 50-year leasehold in a hotel for an initial payment of 25million $33 million
plus the payment of fixed annual rent from an affiliate of a joint venture partner. We expect to fund this commitment during the first or second quarter of 2011. After acquiring the leasehold, we will also have a right and under certain
circumstances an obligation to acquire the landlords interest in the hotel for 45million $60 million during the following three years.  Commitments to invest up to $28 million of equity for noncontrolling interests in partnerships that plan to purchase North American full-service and
limited-service properties or purchase or develop hotel-anchored mixed-use real estate projects. We expect to fund $3 million of these commitments in one to two years and $20 million within three years. We do not expect to fund $5 million of these
investment commitments. If not funded, $8 million of these investment commitments will expire within one to two years, $10 million will expire within three years, and $10 million will expire in more than three years.  A commitment, with no expiration date, to invest up to $27 million 20 million in a joint venture in which we are a partner. We do not expect to
fund under this commitment.

already made deposits of $11 million in conjunction with this commitment. We expect to fulfill the remaining $7 million in the 2011 second quarter.  A commitment, with no expiration date, to invest up to $11 million in a joint venture for development of a new property that we expect to fund within
three years.  A commitment, with no expiration date, to invest up to $7 million in a joint venture that we do not expect to fund.  $4 million 3 million of other purchase commitments that will be funded over the next four years, as follows: $1 million in each of 2011, 2012,
2013 and 2014.  $4 million of loan commitments that we have extended to owners of lodging properties. We expect to fund approximately $1 million of these commitments
within three years, and do not expect to fund the remaining $3 million of commitments, $2 million of which will expire within three years, and $1 million of which will expire after five years.  A $1 million commitment, with no expiration date, to a hotel real estate investment trust in which we have an ownership interest. We expect to fund
this commitment within one year. The commitment is pledged as collateral for certain trust investments. At year-end 2010, we had $81 million of letters of credit outstanding $78 million under our Credit Facility and $3 million outside the Credit Facility, the majority of which related to our
self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued as of year-end 2010, totaled $219 million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our lodging operations, including our Timeshare segment and self-insurance
programs.  17.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS We are a diversified hospitality company with operations in five business segments:  North American Full-Service Lodging, which includes the Marriott Hotels Resorts, JW Marriott, Renaissance Hotels, and Autograph
Collection properties located in the continental United States and Canada. The first Autograph property opened in 2010;  North American Limited-Service Lodging, which includes the Courtyard, Fairfield Inn Suites, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn,
TownePlace Suites, and Marriott ExecuStay properties located in the continental United States and Canada;  International Lodging, which includes the Marriott Hotels Resorts, JW Marriott, Renaissance Hotels, Courtyard, Fairfield
Inn Suites, Residence Inn, and Marriott Executive Apartments properties located outside the continental United States and Canada;  Luxury Lodging, which includes The Ritz-Carlton, Bulgari Hotels Resorts, and EDITION properties worldwide together with adjacent
residential projects associated with some Ritz-Carlton hotels. The first EDITION property opened in 2010; and  Timeshare, which includes the development, marketing, operation, and sale of Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club, The
Ritz-Carlton Residences, and Grand Residences by Marriott timeshare, fractional ownership, and residential properties worldwide. Unless otherwise indicated, our references to Marriott Hotels Resorts include Marriott Conference Centers and JW Marriott, references to Renaissance Hotels include Renaissance ClubSport, and
references to Fairfield Inn Suites include Fairfield Inn. We evaluate the performance of our
segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, income taxes, or indirect general, administrative, and other expenses. With the exception of our Timeshare segment, we do not allocate interest income or
interest expense to our segments. Prior to 2010, we included note securitization gains/losses in our Timeshare segment results. Due to our adoption of the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards, we no longer account for note
receivable securitizations as sales but rather as secured borrowings as defined in these topics, and therefore, we did not recognize gains or losses on the 2010 note receivable securitization nor do we expect to recognize gains or losses on future
note receivable securitizations. We include interest 
98 Table of Contents
income and interest expense associated with our Timeshare segment notes in our Timeshare segment results because financing sales and securitization transactions are an integral part of that
segments business. In addition, we allocate other gains and losses, equity in earnings or losses from our joint ventures, divisional general, administrative, and other expenses, and income or losses attributable to noncontrolling interests to
each of our segments. Other unallocated corporate represents that portion of our revenues, general, administrative, and other expenses, equity in earnings or losses, and other gains or losses that are not allocable to our segments.
We aggregate the brands presented within our North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service,
International, Luxury, and Timeshare segments considering their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, distribution channels, the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment and our organizational
and management reporting structure. Revenues  in millions

Our Financial Statements include the following related to operations located outside the United States which are
predominately related to our International lodging segment:  1.
Revenues of $1,841 million in 2010, $1,700 million in 2009, and $2,230 million in 2008; 2.
Segment results of $252 million in 2010 $91 million from Asia, $71 million from Continental Europe, $67 million from the Americas excluding the United States, $23
million from the Middle East and Africa, and $4 million from Australia, partially offset by a segment loss of $4 million from the United Kingdom and Ireland, segment financial losses of $26 million in 2009, and segment results of $253 million in
2008. Segment losses for 2009 reflect timeshare-strategy impairment charges and restructuring costs, both for our Timeshare segment, totaling $176 million associated with the Americas excluding the United States, Europe, Asia and the United
Kingdom and Ireland of $100 million, $47 million, $22 million, and $7 million, respectively. Segment results for 2008 reflect restructuring costs and other charges, for our Timeshare segment, totaling $12 million associated with the Americas
excluding the United States and with Europe of $2 million and $10 million, respectively; and  3.
Fixed assets of $350 million in 2010 and $325 million in 2009. At year-end 2010 and year-end 2009, fixed assets located outside the United States are included within
the Property and equipment caption in our Balance Sheets. We estimate that, for the
20-year period from 2011 through 2030, the cash flow associated with completing all phases of our existing portfolio of owned timeshare properties will be approximately $28 billion. This estimate is based on our current development plans, which
remain subject to change.  18.
TIMESHARE STRATEGYIMPAIRMENT CHARGES In response to the difficult business conditions that the Timeshare segments timeshare, luxury residential, and luxury fractional real estate development businesses experienced, we evaluated our
entire Timeshare portfolio in the 2009 third quarter. In order to adjust the business strategy to reflect current market conditions at that time, we approved plans for our Timeshare segment to take the following actions: 1for our luxury
residential projects, reduce prices, convert certain proposed projects to other uses, sell some undeveloped land, and not pursue further Marriott-funded residential development projects; 2reduce prices for existing luxury fractional units;
3continue short-term promotions for our U.S. timeshare business and defer the introduction of new projects and development phases; and 4for our European timeshare and fractional resorts, continue promotional pricing and marketing
incentives and not pursue further development. We designed these plans, which primarily relate to luxury residential and fractional resorts, to stimulate sales, accelerate cash flow, and reduce investment spending. 
101 Table of Contents
As a result of these decisions, in 2009 we recorded the charges shown in the
following table in our Income Statements, with charges that impacted operating income under the Timeshare strategy-impairment charges caption and charges that impacted non-operating income under the Timeshare strategy-impairment
charges non-operating caption:  in millions

ongoing mezzanine loan fundings and $21 million of charges for purchase commitments. Grouped by product type and/or geographic location, these impairment charges consisted of $295 million associated with five luxury residential projects, $299
million associated with nine North American luxury fractional projects, $93 million related to one North American timeshare project, $51 million related to the four projects in our European timeshare and fractional business, and $14 million
associated with two Asia Pacific timeshare resorts. Except for the $40 million loan impairment and the $27 million funding liability, we allocated the remaining pretax charges totaling $685 million to our Timeshare segment. 
For additional information on these impairment charges, including how we determined these impairments and the inputs we
used in calculating fair value, please see Footnote No20, Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges, in the Notes to the Financial Statements of our 2009 Form 10-K. 
In the 2010 fourth quarter, we reversed based on facts and circumstances surrounding the project, including progress on
certain construction-related legal claims and potential funding of certain costs by one of our partners $11 million of the $27 million funding liability we recorded in 2009. We recorded the reversal of the funding liability in the equity in
losses earnings line in our Income Statement, but did not allocate it to any of our segments. In addition, the venture was unable to pay one of its promissory notes when it was due on December31, 2010. The partners, on behalf of the venture,
continue to negotiate an extension of the maturity date.  19.
RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND OTHER CHARGES During the latter part of 2008, we experienced a significant decline in demand for hotel rooms worldwide based in part on the failures and near failures of a number of large financial service companies in
the fourth quarter of 2008 and the dramatic downturn in the economy. Our capital-intensive Timeshare business was also hurt globally by the downturn in market conditions and particularly the significant deterioration in the credit markets. These
declines resulted in reduced management and franchise fees, cancellation of development projects, reduced timeshare contract sales, and anticipated losses under guarantees and loans. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we put company-wide cost-saving
measures in place in response to these declines, with individual company segments and corporate departments implementing further cost-saving measures. Upper-level management responsible for the Timeshare segment, hotel operations, development, and
above-property level management of the various corporate departments and brand teams individually led these decentralized management initiatives. The various initiatives resulted in restructuring costs and other charges in the 2008 fourth quarter. For information on the fourth quarter 2008 charges, see Footnote No20, Restructuring
Costs and Other Charges, in the Notes to the Financial Statements of our 2008 Form 10-K. As part of the restructuring actions we began in 2008, we initiated further cost-saving measures in 2009 associated with our Timeshare segment, hotel
development, and above-property level management that resulted in additional restructuring costs of $51 million in 2009. We completed this restructuring in 2009 and have not incurred additional expenses in connection with these initiatives. We also
recorded $162 million of other charges in 2009. For information on the 2009 charges, see Footnote No21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, in the Notes to the Financial Statements of our 2009 Form 10-K.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, we analyze our variable interests, including loans, guarantees, and equity investments, to
determine if an entity in which we have a variable interest is a variable interest entity. Our analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative reviews. We base our quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flows of the entity, and our
qualitative analysis on our review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability, and relevant financial agreements. We also use our qualitative analyses to determine if we must consolidate a variable
interest entity as its primary beneficiary. Variable interest entities related to our timeshare note securitizations
We periodically securitize, without recourse, through special purpose entities, notes receivable
originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional products. These securitizations provide funding for us and transfer the economic risks and substantially all the benefits of the loans to third
parties. In a securitization, various classes of debt securities that the special purpose entities issue are generally collateralized by a single tranche of transferred assets, which consist of timeshare notes receivable. We service the notes
receivable. With each securitization, we may retain a portion of the securities, subordinated tranches, interest-only strips, subordinated interests in accrued interest and fees on the securitized receivables or, in some cases, overcollateralization
and cash reserve accounts. Under GAAP as it existed prior to 2010, these entities met the definition of
QSPEs, and we were not required to evaluate them for consolidation. We began evaluating these entities for consolidation when we implemented the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards in the 2010 first quarter. We created
these entities to serve as a mechanism for holding assets and related liabilities, and the entities have no equity investment at risk, making them variable interest entities. We continue to service the notes, transfer all proceeds collected to these
special purpose entities, and retain rights to receive benefits that are potentially significant to the entities. Accordingly, we concluded under the new Transfers of Financial Assets and Consolidation standards that we are the entities
primary beneficiary and, therefore, consolidate them. Please see Footnote No1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information, including the impact of initial consolidation of these entities. 
At year-end 2010, consolidated assets included in our Balance Sheet that are collateral for the obligations of these
variable interest entities had a carrying amount of $1,081 million, comprised of $118 million of current notes receivable and $911 million of long-term notes receivable each net of reserves, $7 million of interest receivable and $31 million and
$14 million, respectively, of current and long-term restricted cash. Further, at year-end 2010, consolidated liabilities included in our Balance Sheet for these variable interest entities had a carrying amount of $1,020 million, comprised of $3
million of interest payable, $126 million of current portion of long-term debt, and $891 million of long-term debt. The noncontrolling interest balance was zero. The creditors of these entities do not have general recourse to us. As a result of
103 Table of Contents
our involvement with these entities, we recognized $147 million of interest income, offset by $51 million of interest expense to investors, and $4 million in debt issuance cost amortization.
The following table shows cash flows between us and the timeshare notes securitization variable interest
entities:  Cash inflows 2010 Proceeds from securitization 215 Principal receipts 231 Interest receipts 142 Reserve release 3 Total 591 Cash outflows Principal to investors 230 Repurchases 93 Interest to investors 53 Total 376 Net Cash Flows 215 Under the terms of our timeshare note securitizations, we have the right at our option to
repurchase defaulted mortgage notes at the outstanding principal balance. The transaction documents typically limit such repurchases to 10 to 15 percent of the transactions initial mortgage balance. We made voluntary repurchases of defaulted
notes of $68 million during 2010, $81 million during 2009, and $56 million during 2008. We also made voluntary repurchases of $25 million of other non-defaulted notes during 2010. Our maximum exposure to loss relating to the entities that own these
notes is the overcollateralization amount the difference between the loan collateral balance and the balance on the outstanding notes, plus cash reserves and any residual interest in future cash flows from collateral. 
Other variable interest entities In 2010, we completed the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in an entity that develops and markets fractional ownership and residential interests. We had previously concluded that the entity was
a variable interest entity because the voting rights were not proportionate to the economic interests and we had consolidated the entity because we were the primary beneficiary. Following our acquisition of the noncontrolling interest, we determined
that this now wholly-owned entity was no longer a variable interest entity. In 2010, we caused the sale of
substantially all of the assets and liabilities of an entity in which we have a call option on the equity, resulting in an $18 million gain and net cash flow of $38 million. We had previously concluded that the entity, which holds property and land
acquired for timeshare development that we operated as a hotel, was a variable interest entity because the equity investment at risk was not sufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional support from other parties. We
concluded we were the primary beneficiary because we had ultimate power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. Our involvement with the entity did not have a material effect on our financial
performance or cash flows prior to 2010. We have an equity investment in and a loan receivable due from a
variable interest entity that develops and markets fractional ownership and residential interests. We concluded that the entity is a variable interest entity because the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its
activities without additional support from other parties. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary as power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of the entity is shared among the variable
interest holders, and therefore do not consolidate the entity. In 2009, we fully impaired our equity investment and certain loans receivable due from the entity. In 2010, the continued application of equity losses to our outstanding loan receivable
balance reduced its carrying value to zero. We may fund up to an additional $16 million and do not expect to recover this amount, which we have accrued and included in current liabilities. See Footnote No18, Timeshare
Strategy-Impairment Charges, for additional information. We do not have any remaining exposure to loss related to this entity. In conjunction with the transaction with CTF described more fully in Footnote No8, Acquisitions and Dispositions, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2007, under the caption
2005 Acquisitions, we manage hotels on behalf of tenant entities 100 percent owned by CTF, which lease the hotels from third-party owners. Due to certain provisions in the management agreements, we account for these contracts as
operating leases. At the end of 2010 we managed ten hotels on behalf of three tenant entities. The entities have minimal equity and minimal assets comprised of hotel working capital and furniture, fixtures, and equipment. In conjunction with the
2005 transaction, CTF had placed money in a trust account to cover cash flow shortfalls and to meet rent payments. In turn, we released CTF from its guarantees fully in connection with seven of these properties and partially in connection with the
other three properties. At year-end 2010, the trust account held less than $1 million. The tenant entities are variable interest entities because the holder of the equity 
104 Table of Contents
investment at risk, CTF, lacks the ability through voting rights to make key decisions about the entities activities that have a significant effect on the success of the entities. We do not
consolidate the entities because we do not bear the majority of the expected losses. We are secondarily liable after exhaustion of funds from the trust account for rent payments for seven of the ten hotels if there are cash flow shortfalls. Future
minimum lease payments through the end of the lease term for these hotels totaled approximately $49 million. In addition, we are secondarily liable for rent payments of up to an aggregate cap of $15 million for the three other hotels if there are
cash flow shortfalls. Our maximum exposure to loss is limited to the rent payments and certain other tenant obligations under the lease, for which we are secondarily liable. 21.

RELATIONSHIP WITH MAJOR CUSTOMER At year-end 2010 and 2009, Host Hotels Resorts, Inc., formerly known as Host Marriott Corporation, and its affiliates Host owned or leased 146 lodging properties that we operated
under long-term agreements. We recognized the following revenues which are included in our North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, Luxury, and International segments from lodging properties owned or leased over the last three
years: $2,036 million in 2010, $2,096 million in 2009, and $2,539 in 2008. Host is also a partner in certain
unconsolidated partnerships that own lodging properties that we operate under long-term agreements. As of year-end 2010 and 2009, Host was affiliated with five such properties. We recognized the following revenues which are included in our North
American Full-Service, Luxury, and International segments for 2010, 2009 and 2008, as well as our North American Limited-Service segment for 2008 from lodging properties associated with Host partnerships over the last three years: $112 million in
2010, $104 million in 2009, and $411 million in 2008.  24.
SUBSEQUENT EVENT On February14, 2011, we announced a plan to split the companys businesses into two separate, publicly traded companies. Under the plan, we expect to spin off our timeshare operations and
development business as a new independent company through a special tax-free dividend to our shareholders in late 2011. The new company will focus on the timeshare business as the exclusive developer and operator of timeshare, fractional, and
related products under the Marriott brand and the exclusive developer of fractional and related products under the Ritz-Carlton brand. After the split, we will concentrate on the lodging management and franchise business. We will receive franchise
fees from the new timeshare companys use of the Marriott timeshare and Ritz-Carlton fractional brands. 
As two separate public companies, Marriott and the new timeshare company will have separate boards of directors. William
J. Shaw, who recently announced his retirement as vice chairman of Marriott and also resigned from its board, will become chairman of the board of the new timeshare company and Deborah Marriott Harrison, senior vice president of government affairs
for Marriott, will serve as a board member of the new timeshare company. J.W. Marriott, Jr. will remain chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Marriott. Stephen P. Weisz, president of Marriotts timeshare business since 1997 and a
39-year Marriott veteran, will become chief executive officer of the new company. We expect that the common stock of the new timeshare company will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. We do not expect that the new timeshare company will pay a
quarterly cash dividend or be investment grade in the near term. We expect that the new timeshare company
will file a Form 10 registration statement with the SEC in the second quarter 2011. At that time, we will disclose additional details about the proposed transaction, including respective pro forma balance sheets and pro forma income statements of
the two companies. The transaction is subject to the receipt of normal and customary regulatory approvals and third-party consents, the execution of inter-company agreements, receipt of a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service,
arrangement of adequate financing facilities, final approval by our board of directors, and other related matters. The transaction will not require shareholder approval and will have no impact on Marriotts contractual obligations to the
existing securitizations. Subject to the completion of this ongoing work, and the receipt of regulatory approvals, the spin-off should be completed before year end 2011.

reasonable assurance about managements control objectives. You should note that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure you that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Based upon the foregoing evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective and operating to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions about required disclosure.
