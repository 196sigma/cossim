ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATAMANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for Valero. Our management evaluated the effectiveness of Valeros internal control over financial reporting as of  December31, 2012. In its evaluation, management used the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Management believes that as of December31, 2012, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which begins on page 60of this report58Table of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Stockholdersof Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries:We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2012and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2012. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2012and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February28, 2013expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting./s/ KPMG LLPSan Antonio, TexasFebruary28, 201359Table of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Stockholdersof Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries:We have audited Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Frameworkissued by COSO60Table of ContentsWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS1.BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESBasis of Presentation GeneralAs used in this report, the terms Valero, we, us, or our may refer to Valero Energy Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole. We are an independent petroleum refining and marketing company and own 16refineries with a combined total throughput capacity of approximately 30millionbarrels per day as of December31, 2012. We market branded and unbranded refined products on a wholesale basis in the United States U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom U.K., and Ireland through an extensive bulk and rack marketing network, and we sell refined products through a network of 1,880company-owned and leased retail sites in the U.S. and Canada and 5,450branded wholesale sites that we neither own nor operate in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Aruba, and Ireland. Refined products are marketed under various brand names including Valero, Diamond Shamrock, Shamrock, Ultramar, Beacon, and Texaco. We also produce ethanol and operate tenethanol plants in the U.S. with a combined nameplate production capacity of approximately 11billiongallons per year as of December31, 2012. Our operations are affected by:company-specific factors, primarily refinery utilization rates and refinery maintenance turnarounds;seasonal factors, such as the demand for refined products during the summer driving season and heating oil during the winter season; andindustry factors, such as movements in and the level of crude oil prices including the effect of quality differentials between grades of crude oil, the demand for and prices of refined products, industry supply capacity, and competitor refinery maintenance turnarounds.We have evaluated subsequent events that occurred after December31, 2012through the filing of this Form10-K. Any material subsequent events that occurred during this time have been properly recognized or disclosed in these financial statements.Significant Accounting  amounts previously reported in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 have been reclassified to conform to the 2012 presentation.Principles of ConsolidationGeneralThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Valero and subsidiaries in which Valero has a controlling interest. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in significant noncontrolled entities are accounted for using the equity method.Noncontrolling InterestOn January21, 2011, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Darling Green Energy LLC, a subsidiary of Darling International, Inc., to form Diamond Green Diesel Holdings LLC DGD Holdings. DGD Holdings, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Diamond Green Diesel LLC DGD, is constructing and will operate a biomass-based diesel plant having a design feed capacity of 10,000barrels per day that will process animal fats, used cooking oils, and other vegetable oils into renewable green diesel. The plant will be located next to our St. Charles Refinery. The aggregate cost of this facility is estimated to be approximately 67Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued$368millionand the construction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2013. The joint venture agreement requires that contributions be made to DGD Holdings based on the percentage of units held by each member, which is currently on a 50/50basis. In addition, on May31, 2011, we agreed to lend DGD up to $221millionin order to finance 60 percentof the construction costs of the plant.Because of our controlling financial interest in DGD Holdings, we have included the financial statements of DGD Holdings in these consolidated financial statements and have separately disclosed the related noncontrolling interest.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, we review our estimates based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates.Cash and Temporary Cash InvestmentsOur temporary cash investments are highly liquid, low-risk debt instruments that have a maturity of three monthsor less when acquired. ReceivablesTrade receivables are carried at original invoice amount. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is adjusted based on managements assessment of our customers historical collection experience, known credit risks, and industry and economic conditions. InventoriesInventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. The cost of refinery feedstocks purchased for processing, refined products, and grain and ethanol inventories are determined under the last-in, first-out LIFO method using the dollar-value LIFO method, with any increments valued based on average purchase prices during the year. The cost of feedstocks and products purchased for resale and the cost of materials, supplies, and convenience store merchandise are determined principally under the weighted-average cost method.Property, Plant and EquipmentThe cost of property, plant and equipment property assets purchased or constructed, including betterments of property assets, is capitalized. However, the cost of repairs to and normal maintenance of property assets is expensed as incurred. Betterments of property assets are those which extend the useful life, increase the capacity or improve the operating efficiency of the asset, or improve the safety of our operations. The cost of property assets constructed includes interest and certain overhead costs allocable to the construction activities.Our operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. Each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure Units, and these Units are continuously improved. Improvements consist of the addition of new Units and betterments of existing Units. We plan for these improvements by developing a multi-year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors68Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedDepreciation of property assets used in our refining segment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets primarily using the composite method of depreciation. We maintain a separate composite group of property assets for each of our refineries. We estimate the useful life of each group based on an evaluation of the property assets comprising the group, and such evaluations consist of, but are not limited to, the physical inspection of the assets to determine their condition, consideration of the manner in which the assets are maintained, assessment of the need to replace assets, and evaluation of the manner in which improvements impact the useful life of the group. The estimated useful lives of our composite groups range primarily from 25to 30 years.Under the composite method of depreciation, the cost of an improvement is added to the composite group to which it relates and is depreciated over that groups estimated useful life. We design improvements to our refineries in accordance with engineering specifications, design standards and practices accepted in our industry, and these improvements have design lives consistent with our estimated useful lives. Therefore, we believe the use of the group life to depreciate the cost of improvements made to the group is reasonable because the estimated useful life of each improvement is consistent with that of the group. It should be noted, however, that factors such as competition, regulation, or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting depreciation expense in the future.Also under the composite method of depreciation, the historical cost of a minor property asset net of salvage value that is retired or replaced is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized in income. However, a gain or loss is recognized in income for a major property asset that is retired, replaced or sold and for an abnormal disposition of a property asset primarily involuntary conversions. Gains and losses are reflected in depreciation and amortization expense, unless such amounts are reported separately due to materiality.Depreciation of property assets used in our retail and ethanol segments is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements and assets acquired under capital leases are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related asset.Deferred Charges and Other AssetsDeferred charges and other assets, net include the following:turnaround costs, which are incurred in connection with planned major maintenance activities at our refineries and ethanol plants and which are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of time estimated to lapse until the next turnaround occurs;fixed-bed catalyst costs, representing the cost of catalyst that is changed out at periodic intervals when the quality of the catalyst has deteriorated beyond its prescribed function, which are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the specific catalyst;investments in entities that we do not control; andother noncurrent assets such as convenience store dealer incentive programs, investments of certain benefit plans related primarily to certain U.S. nonqualified defined benefit plans whose plan assets are not protected from our creditors and therefore cannot be reflected as a reduction from our obligations under those pension plans, debt issuance costs, and various other costs69Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedImpairment of AssetsLong-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and refinery turnaround and catalysts costs, are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset is not recoverable if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. If a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value, with fair value determined based on discounted estimated net cash flows or other appropriate methods. See Note 4for our impairment analysis of our long-lived assets.We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in income, and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount.Environmental MattersLiabilities for future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments from governmental regulatory agencies and/or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Other than for assessments, the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the completion of investigations or other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action. Environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20-year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies, without establishing a range of loss for these liabilities. Environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. Amounts recorded for environmental liabilities have not been reduced by possible recoveries from third parties.Asset Retirement ObligationsWe record a liability, which is referred to as an asset retirement obligation, at fair value for the estimated cost to retire a tangible long-lived asset at the time we incur that liability, which is generally when the asset is purchased, constructed, or leased. We record the liability when we have a legal obligation to incur costs to retire the asset and when a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the liability can be made. If a reasonable estimate cannot be made at the time the liability is incurred, we record the liability when sufficient information is available to estimate the liabilitys fair value.Foreign Currency TranslationThe functional currency of each of our international operations is generally the respective local currency, which includes the Canadian dollar, the Aruban florin, the pound sterling, and the euro. Balance sheet accounts are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Revenue and expense accounts are translated using the weighted-average exchange rates during the year presented. Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income70Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedRevenue RecognitionRevenues for products sold by the refining, retail, and ethanol segments are recorded upon delivery of the products to our customers, which is the point at which title to the products is transferred, and when payment has either been received or collection is reasonably assured.We present excise taxes on sales by our U.S. retail system on a gross basis with supplemental information regarding the amount of such taxes included in revenues provided in a footnote on the face of the statements of income. All other excise taxes are presented on a net basis.We enter into certain purchase and sale arrangements with the same counterparty that are deemed to be made in contemplation of one another. We combine these transactions and, as a result, revenues and cost of sales are not recognized in connection with these arrangements. We also enter into refined product exchange transactions to fulfill sales contracts with our customers by accessing refined products in markets where we do not operate our own refineries. These refined product exchanges are accounted for as exchanges of non-monetary assets, and no revenues are recorded on these transactions.Product Shipping and Handling CostsCosts incurred for shipping and handling of products are included in cost of sales.Stock-Based CompensationCompensation expense for our share-based compensation plans is based on the fair value of the awards granted and is recognized in income on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of each award. For new grants that have retirement-eligibility provisions, we use the non-substantive vesting period approach, under which compensation cost is recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved if that date is expected to occur during the nominal vesting period.Income TaxesIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred amounts are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.We have elected to classify any interest expense and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes in income tax expense.Earnings per Common ShareEarnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Participating share-based payment awards, including shares of restricted stock granted under certain of our stock-based compensation plans, are included in the computation of basic earnings per share using the two-class method. Earnings per common share assuming dilution reflects the potential dilution arising from our outstanding stock options and nonvested shares granted to employees in connection with our stock-based compensation plans. Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the 71Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedcomputation of earnings per common share assuming dilution when the effect of including such shares would be antidilutive. Financial InstrumentsOur financial instruments include cash and temporary cash investments, receivables, payables, debt, capital lease obligations, commodity derivative contracts, and foreign currency derivative contracts. The estimated fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts, except for certain debt as discussed in Note20. Derivatives and HedgingAll derivative instruments are recorded in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair values. When we enter into a derivative instrument, it is designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, an economic hedge, or a trading derivative. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized currently in income in the same period. The effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in income as incurred. For our economic hedging relationships derivative instruments not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges and for derivative instruments entered into for trading purposes, the derivative instrument is recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized currently in income. The cash flow effects of all of our derivative instruments are reflected in operating activities in the statements of cash flows.New Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2011, the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 210, Balance Sheet, were amended to require an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of these arrangements on its financial position. In January 2013, the provisions of ASC Topic210 were further amended to clarify that the scope of the previous amendment only applies to derivative instruments, including separated bifurcated derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either eligible for offset in the balance sheet or are subject to an agreement similar to a master netting agreement. The guidance requires entities to disclose both gross information and net information about assets and liabilities within the scope of the amendment. These provisions are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after January1, 2013. The adoption of this guidance effective January1, 2013 will not affect our financial position or results of operations, but will result in additional disclosures.In February 2013, the provisions of ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income, were amended to require an entity to disclose information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. For amounts required to be reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income in their entirety in the same reporting period, the guidance requires entities to present significant amounts by the respective line items of net income, either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to the financial statements. For other amounts that are not required to be reclassified to net income in their entirety, a cross-reference is required to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts. These provisions are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2012. The adoption of 72Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedthis guidance effective January1, 2013 will not affect our financial position or results of operations, but will result in additional  of RefineriesThe acquired refining and marketing businesses discussed below involve the production and marketing of refined petroleum products. These acquisitions are consistent with our general business strategy and complement our existing refining and marketing network.Meraux AcquisitionOn October1, 2011, we acquired the Meraux Refinery and related logistics assets from Murphy Oil Corporation for an initial payment of $586 million, which was funded from available cash. This acquisition is referred to as the Meraux Acquisition. The Meraux Refinery has a total throughput capacity of 135,000barrels per day and is located in Meraux, Louisiana.In the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded an adjustment related to inventories acquired that reduced the purchase price to $547 million. In the fourth quarter of 2012, an independent appraisal of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and certain other evaluations of the fair values related to the Meraux Acquisition were completed and finalized. The purchase price of the Meraux Acquisition was allocated based on the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition resulting from this final appraisal and other evaluations. The primary adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation disclosed in 2011 consisted of an $8millionincrease in materials and supplies inventories, a $27milliondecrease in property, plant and equipment, and a $19millionincrease in deferred charges and other assets, net. The final amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Meraux Acquisition were recognized at their acquisition-date fair values and are as follows in  plant and equipment293Deferred charges and other assets, net28Other long-term liabilities1Purchase price$547Pembroke AcquisitionOn August1, 2011, we acquired 100 percentof the outstanding shares of Chevron Limited from a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation Chevron, and we subsequently changed the name of Chevron Limited to Valero Energy Ltd. Valero Energy Ltd owns and operates the Pembroke Refinery, which has a total throughput capacity of 270,000barrels per day and is located in Wales, U.K. Valero Energy Ltd also owns, directly and through various subsidiaries, an extensive network of marketing and logistics assets throughout the U.K. and Ireland. On the acquisition date, we initially paid $18 billionfrom available cash, of which $11 billionwas for working capital. Subsequent to the acquisition date, we recorded an adjustment to working capital primarily inventory, resulting in an adjusted purchase price of $17 billion. This acquisition is referred to as the Pembroke Acquisition73Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedIn the third quarter of 2012, an independent appraisal of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and certain other evaluations of the fair values related to the Pembroke Acquisition were completed and finalized. The purchase price of the Pembroke Acquisition was allocated based on the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition resulting from this final appraisal and other evaluations. The primary adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation disclosed in 2011 consisted of a $143millionincrease in property, plant and equipment, a $124 millionincrease in deferred income taxes, and a $17 millionincrease in other long-term liabilities. The final amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Pembroke Acquisition were recognized at their acquisition-date fair values and are as follows in millions:Current assets, net of cash acquired$2,215Property, plant and equipment947Intangible assets22Deferred charges and other assets, net37Current liabilities, less current portion of debt and capital lease obligations1,294Debt and capital leases assumed, including current portion12Deferred income taxes159Other long-term liabilities60Noncontrolling interest5Purchase price, net of cash acquired$1,691Because of the adjustment to property, plant and equipment discussed above, we recorded an additional $6millionof depreciation expense in the third quarter of 2012 to true-up depreciation expense for the period from the date of the Pembroke Acquisition August1, 2011 through July31, 2012.In connection with the Pembroke Acquisition, we acquired an 85 percentinterest in Mainline Pipelines Limited MLP. MLP owns a pipeline that distributes refined products from the Pembroke Refinery to terminals in the U.K. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we acquired the remaining 15 percentinterest in MLP.Acquisitions of Ethanol PlantsThe acquired ethanol businesses as discussed below involve the production and marketing of ethanol and its co-products, including distillers grains. The operations of our ethanol business complement our existing clean motor fuels business.ASA and Renew AssetsIn December 2009, we signed an agreement with ASA Ethanol Holdings, LLC to buy twoethanol plants located in Linden, Indiana and Bloomingburg, Ohio and made a $20millionadvance payment towards the acquisition of these plants. In January 2010, we completed the acquisition of these plants, including certain inventories, for total consideration of $202million.Also in December 2009, we received approval from a bankruptcy court to acquire oneethanol plant located near Jefferson, Wisconsin from Renew Energy LLC and made a $1millionadvance payment towards the 74Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedacquisition of this plant. We completed the acquisition of this plant, including certain receivables and inventories, in February 2010 for total consideration of $79million3.SALES OF ASSETSPaulsboro RefineryIn December 2010, we sold our Paulsboro Refinery to PBF Holding Company LLC PBF Holding. Working capital, consisting primarily of inventory, was included as part of this transaction. The results of operations of the Paulsboro Refinery, including the loss on the sale discussed below, have been presented as discontinued operations for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010.We received total proceeds of $707 million, including $361 millionfrom the sale of working capital, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $980 million$610 millionafter taxes. The loss includes a $50 millioncharge related to a LIFO inventory liquidation that resulted from the sale of inventory to PBF Holding. The sale proceeds consisted of $547 millionof cash and a $160 millionnote secured by the Paulsboro Refinery. In February 2012, we received full payment on this note.Selected results of operations of the Paulsboro Refinery prior to its sale, excluding the loss on the sale in 2010, are shown below inmillions.Year Ended December 31,20112010Operating revenues$$4,692Loss before income taxes953Delaware City Refinery Assets and Associated Terminal and Pipeline AssetsIn November 2009, we announced the permanent shutdown of our Delaware City Refinery, and wrote-down the book value of the refinery assets to net realizable value. The results of operations of the Delaware City Refinery have been presented as discontinued operations for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010.In June 2010, we sold the shutdown refinery assets and associated terminal and pipeline assets to wholly owned subsidiaries of PBF Energy Partners LP for $220millionof cash proceeds. The sale resulted in a gain of $92million$58millionafter taxes related to the shutdown refinery assets and a gain of $3millionrelated to the terminal and pipeline assets. The gain on the sale of the shutdown refinery assets primarily resulted from receiving proceeds related to the scrap value of the assets and the reversal of certain liabilities recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009 associated with the shutdown of the refinery, which we did not incur because of the sale. This gain is presented in discontinued operations for the year ended December31, 201075Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedSelected results of operations of the Delaware City Refinery prior to its sale, excluding the gain on the sale in 2010, are shown below in millions.Year Ended December 31,20112010Operating revenues$$Loss before income taxes329Investment in Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company CHOPSIn November 2010, we sold our 50 percentinterest in CHOPS to Genesis Energy, L.P. for total cash proceeds of $330 million. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $55 million$36 millionafter taxes, which is included in other income, net for the year ended December31, 2010. CHOPS is a general partnership that operates a 390-mile pipeline, which delivers up to 500,000barrels per day of crude oil from the Gulf of Mexico to major refining areas of Port Arthur and Texas City, Texas4.IMPAIRMENTSAruba RefineryIn September 2012, we decided to reorganize the Aruba Refinery into a crude oil and refined products terminal in response to the withdrawal of a non-binding offer to purchase the refinery. We had received the offer on March28, 2012, and had accepted it, subject to the finalization of a purchase and sale agreement, but the interested party withdrew its offer on August14, 2012.We suspended the operations of the Aruba Refinery in March 2012 because of its inability to generate positive cash flows on a sustained basis subsequent to its restart in January 2011 and the sensitivity of its profitability to sour crude oil differentials, which had narrowed significantly in the fourth quarter of 2011. Shortly thereafter, we received the non-binding offer to purchase the refinery for $350 million, plus working capital as of the closing date. Because of our decision to suspend operations and the possibility of selling the refinery, we evaluated the refinery for potential impairment as of March 31, 2012 and concluded that it was impaired. We wrote down the refinerys net book value carrying value of $945 millionto its estimated fair value of $350 million, resulting in an asset impairment loss of $595 millionthat was recorded in March 2012. We determined that the best measure of the refinerys fair value at that time was the $350 millionoffer because it was based on the interested partys specific knowledge of the refinery, experience in the refining and marketing industry, and extensive knowledge of the economic factors affecting our business. We did not, however, classify the Aruba Refinery as held for sale in our balance sheet because all of the accounting criteria required for that classification had not been met.Because of our decision to reorganize the Aruba Refinery into a crude oil and refined products terminal, we bifurcated the idled crude oil processing units and related infrastructure refining assets from the terminal assets and evaluated the refining assets for potential impairment as of September30, 2012. We concluded that the refining assets were impaired and determined that their carrying value of $308 millionwas not recoverable through the future operations and disposition of the refinery. We determined that these refining assets had no value after considering estimated salvage costs, resulting in an asset impairment loss of $308millionthat was recorded in September 2012. We also recognized an asset impairment loss of $25millionrelated to materials and supplies inventories that supported the refining operations, resulting in 76Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continueda total asset impairment loss of $333millionthat was recognized in September 2012 related to the Aruba Refinery. The terminal assets were not impaired as of September30, 2012.We currently intend to maintain the refining assets to allow them to be restarted and do not consider them to be abandoned. Therefore, we have not reflected the Aruba Refinery as a discontinued operation in our financial statements. It is possible, however, that we may abandon these assets in the future. Should we ultimately decide to abandon these assets, we may be required under our land lease agreement with the Government of Aruba GOA to recognize an asset retirement obligation, and the amount recognized would be immediately charged to expense. We do not expect these amounts to be material to our financial position or results of operations.Cancelled Capital ProjectsDuring 2012 and 2010, we wrote down the carrying value of equipment associated with permanently cancelled capital projects at several of our refineries and recognized asset impairment losses of $65 millionand $2million, respectively.Retail StoresDuring 2012, we evaluated certain of our convenience stores operated by our retail segment for potential impairment and concluded that they were impaired, and we wrote down the carrying values of these stores to their estimated fair values and recognized asset impairment losses of $21  consisted of the following in millions:December 31,20122011Accounts  derivative and foreign currency contract receivables136174Notes receivable and other262148,2238,754Allowance for doubtful accounts5648Receivables, net$8,167$8,706Notes receivable in 2011 primarily represent amounts due from PBF Holding related to the sale of the Paulsboro Refinery, the full payment of which was received in February 201277Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedChanges in the allowance for doubtful accounts consisted of the following in millions:Year Ended December 31,201220112010Balance as of beginning of year$48$42$45Increase in allowance charged to expense212114Accounts charged against the allowance,net of recoveries131417Foreign currency translation1Balance as of end of year$56$48$426.INVENTORIES Inventories consisted of the following in millions:December 31,20122011Refinery feedstocks$2,458$2,474Refined products and blendstocks2,9952,633Ethanol feedstocks and products191195Convenience store merchandise112103Materials and  the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, we had net liquidations of LIFO inventory layers that were established in prior years, which decreased cost of sales in each of those years by $134million, $247million, and $16million, respectively. The effect of the liquidation in 2010 excludes the impact from the sale of inventory in connection with the sale of our Paulsboro Refinery to PBF Holding. The effect of the 2010 liquidation attributable to the sale of that inventory increased the loss on the sale of the Paulsboro Refinery by $50million$31millionafter taxes as discussed in Note3and is reflected in discontinued operations.As of December31, 2012and 2011, the replacement cost market value of LIFO inventories exceeded their LIFO carrying amounts by approximately $67billionand $68billion, respectively78Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued7.PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENTMajor classes of property, plant and equipment, which include capital lease assets, consisted of the following inmillions:December 31,20122011Land$802$722Crude oil processing  and terminal facilities1,471856Grain processing equipment694673Retail   in progress2,6293,332Property, plant and equipment, at cost34,13232,253Accumulated  plant and equipment, net$26,300$25,177We have miscellaneous assets under capital leases that primarily support our refining operations totaling $83millionand $77millionas of December31, 2012and 2011, respectively.

All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis. The gross carrying amount of intangible assets as of December31, 2012and 2011was $429millionand $417million, respectively. The accumulated amortization of intangible assets was $216millionand $190millionas of December31, 2012and 2011, respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $22million, $18million, and $22millionfor the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The estimated aggregate amortization expense for the years ending December31, 2013 through December 31, 2017 is as follows in  CHARGES AND OTHER ASSETSDeferred charges and other assets, net primarily includes turnaround and catalyst costs, which are deferred and amortized as discussed in Note 1. Amortization expense for deferred refinery turnaround and catalyst costs was $459million, $444million, and $383millionfor the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively10.ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIESAccrued expenses and other long-term liabilities consisted of the following as of December 31 in millions:Accrued ExpensesOther Long-Term  benefit plan liabilities see Note 14$32$37$982$795Wage and other employee-related  income tax position liabilities see Note 16391337Environmental liabilities2739242235Accrued interest expense96108Derivative liabilities1425Asset retirement obligations5610381Other accrued  expenses and other long-term  of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedEnvironmental LiabilitiesChanges in our environmental liabilities were as follows in millions:Year Ended December 31,201220112010Balance as of beginning of year$274$268$279Pembroke Acquisition30Additions to liability231850Reductions to liability1521Payments, net of third-party recoveries293542Foreign currency translation222Balance as of end of year$269$274$268In connection with our Pembroke Acquisition, we assumed certain environmental liabilities including, but not limited to, certain remediation obligations, site restoration costs, and certain liabilities relating to soil and groundwater remediation. There were no significant environmental liabilities assumed in connection with the Meraux Acquisition.Asset Retirement ObligationsWe have asset retirement obligations with respect to certain of our refinery assets due to various legal obligations to clean and/or dispose of various component parts of each refinery at the time they are retired. However, these component parts can be used for extended and indeterminate periods of time as long as they are properly maintained and/or upgraded. It is our practice and current intent to maintain our refinery assets and continue making improvements to those assets based on technological advances. As a result, we believe that our refineries have indeterminate lives for purposes of estimating asset retirement obligations because dates or ranges of dates upon which we would retire refinery assets cannot reasonably be estimated at this time. When a date or range of dates can reasonably be estimated for the retirement of any component part of a refinery, we estimate the cost of performing the retirement activities and record a liability for the fair value of that cost using established present value techniques.We also have asset retirement obligations for the removal of underground storage tanks USTs at owned and leased retail sites. There is no legal obligation to remove USTs while they remain in service. However, environmental laws in the U.S. and Canada require that unused USTs be removed within certain periods of time after the USTs are no longer in service, usually one to two years depending on the jurisdiction in which the USTs are located. We have estimated that USTs at our owned retail sites will remain in service approximately 20 yearsand that we will have an obligation to remove those USTs at that time. For our leased retail sites, our lease agreements generally require that we remove certain improvements, primarily USTs and signage, upon termination of the lease81Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedChanges in our asset retirement obligations were as follows in millions.

We notified 495employees in September 2012 of the termination of their employment effective November15, 2012. Benefits to each terminated employee consisted primarily of a cash payment based on a formula that considered the employees current compensation and years of service, among other factors. We recognized a severance liability of $41 millionin September 2012, which approximated fair value. We paid $31millionof these benefits in the fourth quarter of 2012. We expect to pay the remaining termination benefits in the first and second quarters of 2013. Because of the short discount period, the remaining liability of $10millionas of December31, 2012, which is included in other accrued liabilities in the detail of accrued expense and other long-term liabilities, is not materially different from its fair value. Total severance expense of $41millionis included in refining operating expenses for the year ended December31, 2012and relates to our refining segment82Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued11.DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONSDebt, at stated values, and capital lease obligations consisted of the following in  31,20122011Bank credit facilitiesVarious$$Industrial revenue bonds:Tax-exempt Revenue Refunding Bonds:Series 1997A, 545%202718Tax-exempt Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds:Series 1997, 56%203125Series 1998, 56%203225Series 1999, 57%203225Series 2001, 665%20321945% notes2015400400475% notes2013300300475% notes20142002006125% notes20177507506125% notes20208508506625% notes20371,5001,5006875% notes201275075% notes2032750750875%   Opportunity Zone Revenue Bonds, Series 2010, 40%2040300Accounts receivable sales facility2013100250Net unamortized discount, including fair value adjustments2951Total debt7,0007,690Capital lease obligations, including unamortized fair value adjustments4951Total debt and capital lease obligations7,0497,741Less current portion5861,009Debt and capital lease obligations, less current portion$6,463$6,73283Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedBank Debt and Credit FacilitiesWe have a $3billionrevolving credit facility the Revolver that has a maturity date of December 2016. Borrowings under the Revolver bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin, or an alternate base rate as defined under the agreement, plus a margin. We are also charged various fees and expenses in connection with the Revolver, including facility fees and letter of credit fees. The interest rate and fees under the Revolver are subject to adjustment based upon the credit ratings assigned to our non-bank debt. The Revolver has certain restrictive covenants, including a maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio of 60 percent. As of December31, 2012and 2011, our debt-to-capitalization ratios, calculated in accordance with the terms of the Revolver, were 23 percentand 29 percent, respectively. We believe that we will remain in compliance with this covenant.In November 2012, one of our Canadian subsidiaries entered into aC$50 millioncommitted revolving credit facility that has a maturity date of November 2013, which replaced the maturing C$115 millionCanadian revolving credit facility.During the year ended December31, 2012, we borrowed and repaid $11billionunder the Revolver and had noborrowings or repayments under either of the Canadian credit facilities. During the years ended December31, 2011and 2010, we had noborrowings or repayments under the Revolver or the C$115 millionCanadian revolving credit facility.

These bonds were remarketed in June 2012, as previously discussed.During the year ended December31, 2010, the following activity occurred:in December 2010, the Parish of St. Charles, State of Louisiana Issuer issued GO Zone Bonds totaling $300million, with a maturity date of December 1, 2040. The GO Zone Bonds initially bore interest at a weekly rate with interest payable monthly, commencing January 5, 2011. Pursuant to a financing agreement, the Issuer lent the proceeds of the sale of the GO Zone Bonds to us to finance a portion of the construction costs of a hydrocracker project at our St. Charles Refinery. We received proceeds of $300million. Under the financing agreement, we were obligated to pay the Issuer amounts sufficient for the Issuer to pay principal and interest on the GO Zone Bonds;in June 2010, we made a scheduled debt repayment of $25millionrelated to our 725%debentures;in May 2010, we redeemed our 675%senior notes with a maturity date of May1, 2014for $190million, or 10225%of stated value;in April 2010, we made scheduled debt repayments of $8millionrelated to our Series1997A 545%, Series1997B 54%, and Series1997C 54%industrial revenue bonds;in March 2010, we redeemed our 75%senior notes with a maturity date of June15, 2015for $294million, or 1025%of stated value; andin February 2010, we issued $400millionof 45%notes due February 1, 2015and $850millionof 6125%notes due in February 1, 2020for total net proceeds of $12billion.Accounts Receivable Sales FacilityWe have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party entities and financial institutions to sell eligible trade receivables on a revolving basis. In July 2012, we amended our agreement to increase the facility from $10 billionto $15billionand extended the maturity date to July2013. Under this program, one of our marketing subsidiaries Valero Marketing sells eligible receivables, without recourse, to another of our subsidiaries Valero Capital, whereupon the receivables are no longer owned by Valero Marketing. Valero Capital, in turn, sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible receivables, without recourse, to the third-party entities and financial institutions. To the extent that Valero Capital retains an ownership interest in the receivables it has purchased from Valero Marketing, such interest is included in our financial statements solely as a result of the consolidation of the financial statements of Valero Capital with those of Valero Energy Corporation; the receivables are not available to satisfy the claims of the creditors of Valero Marketing or Valero Energy Corporation.As of December31, 2012and 2011, $32billionand $33billion, respectively, of our accounts receivable composed the designated pool of accounts receivable included in the program. All amounts outstanding 85Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedunder the accounts receivable sales facility are reflected as debt on our balance sheets and proceeds and repayments are reflected as cash flows from financing activities on the statements of cash flows.

Certain leases for vessels contain renewal options and escalation clauses, which vary by charter, and provisions for the payment of chartering fees, which either vary based on usage or provide for payments, in addition to established minimums, that are contingent on usage. Leases for convenience stores may also include provisions for contingent rental payments based on sales volumes. In most cases, we expect that in the normal course of business, our leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases.As of December31, 2012, our future minimum rentals and minimum rentals to be received under subleases for leases having initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year were as follows  minimum rental payments$1,335Minimum rentals to be receivedunder subleases$30Rental expense was as follows inmillions:Year Ended December 31,201220112010Minimum rental expense$508$523$485Contingent rental expense232323Total rental expense531546508Less sublease rental income223Net rental expense$529$544$50587Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedPurchase ObligationsWe have various purchase obligations under certain industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements such as hydrogen supply arrangements, crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. None of these obligations are associated with suppliers financing arrangements. These purchase obligations are not reflected as liabilities.Environmental MattersHartford MattersWe are involved, together with several other companies, in an environmental cleanup in the Village of Hartford, Illinois the Village and the adjacent shutdown refinery site, which we acquired as part of a prior acquisition.In cooperation with some of the other companies, we have been conducting initial mitigation and cleanup response pursuant to an administrative order issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA.The EPA is seeking further cleanup obligations from us and other potentially responsible parties for the Village. In parallel with the Village cleanup, we are also in litigation with the State of Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and other potentially responsible parties relating to the remediation of the shutdown refinery site.In each of these matters, we have various defenses and rights for contribution from the other potentially responsible parties.We have accrued for our own expected contribution obligations.However, because of the unpredictable nature of these cleanups and the methodology for allocation of liabilities, it is reasonably possible that we could incur a loss in a range of $0to $250 millionin excess of the amount of our accrual to ultimately resolve these matters.Factors underlying this estimated range are expected to change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from this estimate.Regulation of Greenhouse GasesThe EPA began regulating greenhouse gases on January 2, 2011, under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 Clean Air Act. Any new construction or material expansions will require that, among other things, a greenhouse gas permit be issued at either or both the state or federal level in accordance with the Clean Air Act regulations, and we will be required to undertake a technology review to determine appropriate controls to be implemented with the project in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The determination would be on a case by case basis, and the EPA has provided only general guidance on which controls will be required or delegated to the states through State Implementation Plans.Furthermore, the EPA is currently developing refinery-specific greenhouse gas regulations and performance standards that are expected to impose, on new and modified operations, greenhouse gas emission limits and/or technology requirements. These control requirements may affect a wide range of refinery operations but have not yet been delineated. Any such controls, however, could result in material increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions for our business, and an increase in the cost of the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.Certain states and foreign governments have pursued regulation of greenhouse gases independent of the EPA. For example, the California Global Warming Solutions Act, also known as AB 32, directs the California Air Resources Board CARB to develop and issue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in 88Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedCalifornia to 1990 levels by 2020. CARB has issued a variety of regulations aimed at reaching this goal, including a Low Carbon Fuel Standard LCFS as well as a statewide cap-and-trade program.The LCFS was scheduled to become effective in 2011, but rulings by the U.S. District Court have stayed enforcement of the LCFS until certain legal challenges to the LCFS have been resolved. Most notably, the court determined that the LCFS violates the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution to the extent that the standard discriminates against out-of-state crude oils and corn ethanol. CARB appealed the lower courts ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Ninth Circuit Court, which lifted the stay on April 23, 2012. The Ninth Circuit Court heard arguments on the merits of the appeal in October 2012. We await the Ninth Circuit Courts final ruling on the merits.The California statewide cap-and-trade program became effective in 2012, with the auctioning of emission credits commencing in the fourth quarter of 2012. Initially, the program will apply only to stationary sources of greenhouse gases e.g., refinery and power plant greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from fuels that we sell in California will be covered by the program beginning in 2015. We anticipate that free allocations of credits will be available in the early years of the program, but we expect that compliance costs will increase significantly beginning in 2015, when transportation fuels are included in the program.Complying with AB 32, including the LCFS and the cap-and-trade program, could result in material increased compliance costs for us, increased capital expenditures, increased operating costs, and additional operating restrictions for our business, resulting in an increase in the cost of, and decreases in the demand for, the products we produce. To the degree we are unable to recover these increased costs, these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.Texas Permitting MattersThe EPA has disapproved certain permitting programs of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality TCEQ that historically have streamlined the environmental permitting process or provided greater operational flexibility in Texas. For example, the EPA disapproved the TCEQ flexible permit program and pollution control standard permit, thus requiring the conversion of flexible permits to a more conventional permitting program and precluding the prompt authorization of pollution control equipment. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the EPAs disapproval of the flexible permit program and pollution control standard permit and directed the EPA to reconsider them consistent with the courts decision. In other instances, the EPAs decisions have been initially upheld and others are still pending before the courts. Regardless of the EPAs response to the courts various rulings, further litigation is probable.The EPA has also objected to numerous Title V permits in Texas and other states, including permits at our Port Arthur, Texas City, Meraux, Corpus Christi East, and McKee Refineries. Environmental activist groups have filed notices of intent to sue the EPA, seeking to require the EPA to assume control of these permits from the TCEQ. Finally, as part of its regulation of greenhouse gases discussed above, the EPA has federalized the permitting of greenhouse gas emissions in Texas. This creates a dual permitting structure that must be navigated for material projects in Texas. All of these developments have created substantial uncertainty regarding existing and future permitting. Because of this uncertainty, we are unable to determine the costs or effects of the EPAs actions on our permitting activity. The greenhouse gas permitting regime and the EPAs disruption of the Texas permitting system could result in material increased compliance costs for us, increased capital expenditures, increased operating costs, and additional operating restrictions for our 89Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedbusiness, resulting in an increase in the cost of, and decreases in the demand for, the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.Litigation MattersWe are party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We have not recorded a loss contingency liability with respect to some of these matters because we have determined that it is remote that a loss has been incurred.For other matters, we have recorded a loss contingency liability where we have determined that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and that the loss is reasonably estimable.These loss contingency liabilities are not material to our financial position. We re-evaluate and update our loss contingency liabilities as matters progress over time, and we believe that any changes to the recorded liabilities will not be material to our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.Tax MattersGeneralWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and value-added taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. IRS AuditsAs of December 31, 2012, the Internal Revenue Service IRS has ongoing tax audits related to our U.S. federal tax returns from 2002 through 2009, as discussed in Note16. We have received Revenue Agent Reports on our tax years for 2002 through 2007 and we are vigorously contesting many of the tax positions and assertions from the IRS. Although we believe our tax liabilities are fairly stated and properly reflected in our financial statements, should the IRS eventually prevail, it could result in a material amount of our deferred tax liabilities being reclassified to current liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.ArubaEffective June 1, 2010, the GOA enacted a new tax regime applicable to refinery and terminal operations in Aruba. Under the new tax regime, we are subject to a profit tax rate of 7 percentand a dividend withholding tax rate of zero percent. In addition, all imports and exports are exempt from turnover tax and throughput fees. Beginning June 1, 2012, we are required to make a minimum annual tax payment of $10millionpayable in equal quarterly installments, with the ability to carry forward any excess tax prepayments to future tax years.The new tax regime was the result of a settlement agreement that we and the GOA entered into on February24, 2010 to settle a lengthy and complicated tax dispute between the parties. On May 30, 2010, the Aruban Parliament adopted several laws that implemented the provisions of the settlement agreement, which became effective June 1, 2010. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, we relinquished certain provisions of a previous tax holiday regime. On June 4, 2010, we made a payment to the GOA of $118 millionprimarily from restricted cash held in escrow in consideration of a full release of all tax claims prior to June 1, 2010. 90Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedThis settlement resulted in an after-tax gain of $30millionrecognized primarily as a reduction to interest expense of $8 millionand an income tax benefit of $20 millionfor the year ended December31, 2010.Self-InsuranceWe are self-insured for certain medical and dental, workers compensation, automobile liability, general liability, and property liability claims up to applicable retention limits. Liabilities are accrued for self-insured claims, or when estimated losses exceed coverage limits, and when sufficient information is available to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. These liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities13.EQUITYShare ActivityFor the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, activity in the number of shares of common stock and treasury stock was as follows in  as of December 31, 2009673109Transactions in connection withstock-based compensation plans:Stock issuances5Stock repurchases1Balance as of December 31, 2010673105Transactions in connection withstock-based compensation plans:Stock issuances5Stock repurchases17Balance as of December 31, 2011673117Transactions in connection withstock-based compensation plans:Stock issuances6Stock repurchases6Stock repurchases under buyback program4Balance as of December 31, 2012673121Preferred StockWe have 20millionshares of preferred stock authorized with a par value of $001per share.

We also purchase shares of our common stock from our employees and 91Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuednon-employee directors in connection with the exercise of stock options, the vesting of restricted stock, and other stock compensation transactions.On February 28, 2008, our board of directors approved a $3billioncommon stock purchase program, which is in addition to the remaining amount under a $6billionprogram previously authorized. This additional $3billionprogram has no expiration date. As of December31, 2012, we had purchased $118millionof our common stock under this $3billionprogram. As of December31, 2012, we have approvals under these stock purchase programs to purchase approximately $33 billionof our common stock.Common Stock DividendsOn January23, 2013, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $020per common share payable March13, 2013to holders of record at the close of business on February13, 2013.Income Tax Effects Related to Components of Other Comprehensive IncomeThe following table reflects the tax effects allocated to each component of other comprehensive income for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010:Before-Tax AmountTax Expense BenefitNet AmountYear Ended December 31, 2012:Foreign currency translation adjustment$164$$164Pension and other postretirement benefits:Loss arising during the year related to:Net actuarial loss22879149Prior service cost936Gain loss reclassified into income related to:Net actuarial loss341222Prior service  loss on pension and otherpostretirement  instruments designated andqualifying as cash flow hedges:Net gain arising during the year451629Net gain reclassified into income732647Net loss on cash flow hedges281018Other comprehensive income loss$75$87$1292Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedBefore-Tax AmountTax Expense BenefitNet AmountYear Ended December 31, 2011:Foreign currency translation  and other postretirement benefits:Loss arising during the year related to:Net actuarial loss285100185Prior service cost413Gain loss reclassified into income related to:Net actuarial loss14410Prior service  loss on pension and otherpostretirement  instruments designated andqualifying as cash flow hedges:Net gain arising during the year321121Net gain reclassified into income312Net gain on cash flow hedges291019Other comprehensive loss$385$93$292Year Ended December 31, 2010:Foreign currency translation adjustment$158$$158Pension and other postretirement benefits:Gain loss arising during the year related to:Net actuarial loss40634Prior service credit311120Gain loss reclassified into income related to:Net actuarial loss624Prior service  gain loss on pension and other postretirement benefits16218Derivative instruments designated andqualifying as cash flow hedges:Net loss arising during the year211Net gain reclassified into income17862116Net loss on cash flow hedges18063117Other comprehensive income loss$38$61$2393Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedAccumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeChanges in the balances of each component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss were as follows  Gain Loss On Cash Flow  LossBalance as of December 31, 2009$465$217$117$365Other comprehensive income loss1581811723Balance as of December 31, 2010623235388Other comprehensive income  as of December 31, 20115014241996Other comprehensive income loss1641341812Balance as of December 31,  BENEFIT PLANSDefined Benefit PlansWe have defined benefit pension plans, some of which are subject to collective bargaining agreements, that cover mostof our employees. These plans provide eligible employees with retirement income based primarily on years of service and compensation during specific periods under final average pay and cash balance formulas. We fund our pension plans as required by local regulations. In the U.S., all qualified pension plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ERISA minimum funding standard. We typically do not fund or fully fund U.S. nonqualified and certain international pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than our other investment alternatives.On February 15, 2013, we announced changes to certain of our U.S. qualified pension plans that cover the majority of our U.S. employees who work in our refining segment and corporate operations. Benefits under our primary pension plan will change from a final average pay formula to a cash balance formula with staged effective dates from July1, 2013 through January1, 2015 depending on the age and service of the affected employees. All final average pay benefits will be frozen as of December31, 2014, with all future benefits to be earned under the new cash balance formula. The change will reduce our benefit costs and obligations for 2013 and future years. We also provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees through our postretirement benefit plans. Most of our employees become eligible for these benefits if, while still working for us, they reach normal retirement age or take early retirement. These plans are unfunded, and retired employees share the cost with us. Individuals who became our employees as a result of an acquisition became eligible for other postretirement benefits under our plans as determined by the terms of the relevant acquisition agreement94Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedThe changes in benefit obligation related to all of our defined benefit plans, the changes in fair value of plan assetsa, and the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of and for the years ended December31, 2012and 2011were as follows in millions:Pension PlansOther PostretirementBenefit Plans2012201120122011Changes in benefit obligation:Benefit obligation at beginning of  cost1401041211Interest cost93852122Participant contributions1412Plan amendments94Curtailment gain16Benefits  gain  obligation at end of  in plan assetsa:Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year$1,487$1,362$$Actual return on plan assets1672Valero  contributions1412Benefits  value of plan assets at end of  of funded statusa:Fair value of plan assets at end of year$1,729$1,487$$Less benefit obligation at end of year2,3071,881436438Funded status at end of  benefit  assets include only the assets associated with pension plans subject to legal minimum funding standards.

As a result, the reconciliation of funded status does not reflect the effect of plan assets that exist for all of our defined benefit plans.

This curve was designed by Aon Hewitt to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their pension plans or postretirement benefit plans. It is a hypothetical double-A yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates with maturities from one-half year to 99 years. Each bond issue underlying the curve is required to have an average rating of double-A when averaging all available ratings by Moodys Investor Services Moodys, Standard and Poors Ratings Service SP, and Fitch Ratings. Only the bonds representing the 50percent highest yielding issuance among these with average ratings of double-A are included in this yield curve.We based our December31, 2012and 2011discount rate assumption on the Aon Hewitt AA Only Above Median yield curve because we believe it is representative of the types of bonds we would use to settle our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities as of those dates. We believe that the yields associated with the bonds used to develop this yield curve reflect the current level of interest rates. In 2010, we based our discount rate assumption on the Hewitt Above Median yield curve because it included a larger number of bonds which lessened the effect of outlier bonds whose yields were influenced by the volatility in the market at that time.The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010were as follows:Pension PlansOther PostretirementBenefit   long-term rate of return on plan assets767%769%771 Rate of compensation  of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedThe assumed health care cost trend rates as of December31, 2012and 2011were as follows:20122011Health care cost trend rate assumed for the next year732%743%Rate to which the cost trend rate was assumed to declinethe ultimate trend rate500%500%Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate20202018Assumed health care cost trend rates impact the amounts reported for retiree health care plans.

This approach recognizes that assets are exposed to risk and the market value of the pension plans assets may fluctuate from year to year. Risk tolerance is determined based on our financial ability to withstand risk within the investment program and the willingness to accept return volatility. In line with the investment return objective and risk parameters, the pension plans mix of assets includes a diversified portfolio of equity and fixed-income investments. As of December31, 2012, the target allocations for plan assets are 70 percentequity securities and 30 percentfixed income investments. Equity securities include international stocks and a blend of U.S. growth and value stocks of various sizes of capitalization. Fixed income securities include bonds and notes issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate bonds, and mortgage-backed securities. The aggregate asset allocation is reviewed on an annual basis.The overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the pension plans is estimated using models of asset returns. Model assumptions are derived using historical data given the assumption that capital markets 102Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedare informationally efficient. Threemethods are used to derive the long-term expected returns for each asset class. Because each method has distinct advantages and disadvantages and differing results, an equal weighted average of the methods results is used.Defined Contribution PlansWe have defined contribution plans that cover substantially most of our employees. Our contributions to these plans are based on employees compensation and/or a partial match of employee contributions to the plans. Our contributions to these defined contribution plans were $61million, $59million, and $57millionfor the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively15.STOCK-BASED COMPENSATIONWe have various fixed and performance-based stock compensation plans under which awards have been granted, which are summarized as follows:The 2011 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan the OSIP authorizes the grant of various stock and stock-based awards to our employees and our non-employee directors. Awards available under the OSIP include options to purchase shares of common stock, performance awards that vest upon the achievement of an objective performance goal, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock that vests over a period determined by our compensation committee. The OSIP was approved by our stockholders on April28, 2011. As of December31, 2012, 17,178,084shares of our common stock remained available to be awarded under the OSIP.Prior to the approval of the OSIP by our stockholders, most of the equity awards granted to our employees and non-employee directors were made under our 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan. Prior awards granted under this plan included options to purchase shares of common stock, performance awards that vest upon the achievement of an objective performance goal, and restricted stock that vests over a period determined by our compensation committee. Noadditional grants may be awarded under this plan.The Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors authorized an annual grant of our common stock valued at $160,000to each non-employee director. Vesting generally occurred based on the number of grants received as follows: i initial grants to vest in threeequal annual installments, iisecond grants to vest one-thirdon the first anniversary of the grant date and the remaining two-thirdson the second anniversary of the grant date, and iiiall grants thereafter to vest 100 percenton the first anniversary of the grant date. During 2012, the final grants of available shares under this plan were awarded and noadditional grants may be awarded under this plan. Prospective grants to our non-employee directors will be made under the OSIP, with vesting to occur in annual one-thirdincrements over threeyears.The 2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of various stock and stock-related awards to employees and prospective employees. Awards include options to purchase shares of common stock, performance awards that vest upon the achievement of an objective performance goal, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock that vests over a period determined by our compensation committee. As of December31, 2012, 1,914,877shares of our common stock remained available to be awarded under this plan.In addition, we maintained other stock option and incentive plans under which previously granted equity awards remain outstanding. Noadditional grants may be awarded under these plans. Each of our stock-based compensation arrangements is discussed below. 103Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedThe following table reflects activity related to our stock-based compensation arrangements in millions:Year Ended December 31,201220112010Stock-based compensation expense$58$58$54Tax benefit recognized on stock-based compensation expense202019Tax benefit realized for tax deductions resulting from exercises and vestings453523Effect of tax deductions in excess of recognized stock-based compensation expense reported as a financing cash flow272311Stock OptionsUnder the terms of our various stock-based compensation plans, the exercise price of options granted is not less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options become exercisable pursuant to the individual written agreements between the participants and us, usually in threeor fiveequal annual installments beginning one year after the date of grant, with unexercised options generally expiring sevenor ten yearsfrom the date of grant.The fair value of stock options granted during 2012 was estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model, as these options contain both a service condition and a market condition in order to be exercised. Prior to 2012, the fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The expected life of options granted is the period of time from the grant date to the date of expected exercise or other expected settlement. The expected life for each of the years in the table below was calculated using the safe harbor provisions of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No107 and No110 related to share-based payments. Because the vesting period for all of the stock options granted during the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010was threerather than five yearsas in prior years and the 2012 stock options grants contain a market condition, historical exercise patterns did not provide a reasonable basis for estimating the expected life. Expected volatility is based on closing prices of our common stock for periods corresponding to the expected life of options granted. Expected dividend yield is based on annualized dividends at the date of grant. The risk-free interest rate used is the implied yield currently available from the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options at the grant date.A summary of the weighted-average assumptions used in our fair value measurements is presented in the table below.Year Ended December 31,201220112010Expected life in years606060Expected  dividend yield239%228%105%Risk-free interest rate085%144%183%104Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedA summary of the status of our stock option awards is presented in the table below.Number   yearsin millionsOutstanding as of January 1,  as of December31,  as of December31, 201212,594,488286530152The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010was $1098, $1010, and $817per stock option, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010was $78million, $63million, and $25million, respectively. Cash received from stock option exercises for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010was $59million, $49million, and $20million, respectively.As of December31, 2012, there was $1millionof unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding unvested stock option awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two years105Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedRestricted StockRestricted stock is granted to employees and non-employee directors. Restricted stock granted to employees vests in accordance with individual written agreements between the participants and us, usually in equal annual installments over a period of threeto five yearsbeginning one year after the date of grant. Restricted stock granted to our non-employee directors vests from oneto three yearsfollowing the date of grant. A summary of the status of our restricted stock awards is presented in the table below.Number ofShares  ValuePer ShareNonvested shares as of January 1,  shares as of December31, 20122,920,2882476As of December31, 2012, there was $40millionof unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding unvested restricted stock awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately two years. The total fair value of restricted stock that vested during the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010was $47million, $32million, and $25million, respectively.Performance AwardsPerformance awards are issued to certain of our key employees and represent rights to receive shares of our common stock upon the achievement by us of an objective performance measure. The objective performance measure is our total shareholder return, which is ranked among the total shareholder returns of a defined peer group of companies. Our ranking determines the rate at which the performance awards convert into our common shares. Conversion rates can range from zeroto 200 percent.Performance awards vest in equal one-thirdincrements tranches on an annual basis. Our compensation committee establishes the peer group of companies for each tranche of awards at the beginning of the          one-year vesting period for that tranche. Therefore, performance awards are not considered to be granted for accounting purposes until our compensation committee establishes the peer group of companies for each tranche of awards. The fair value of each tranche of awards is determined at the time the awards are considered to be granted and is based on the expected conversion rate for those awards and the fair value per share. Fair value per share is equal to the market price of our common stock on the grant date reduced by expected dividends over that tranches vesting period.If a tranche of the performance awards awarded in 2010 fails to meet the minimum performance measure at the end of its vesting period as established by our compensation committee, that tranche of awards remains outstanding for an additional year and may convert into our common shares that following year. If such tranche of awards does not convert to our common shares the following year, those awards are forfeited.

However, other financial instruments, such as debt obligations, are not required to be recognized at their fair values, but GAAP provides an option to elect fair value accounting for these instruments. GAAP requires the disclosure of the fair values of all financial instruments, regardless of whether they are recognized at their fair values or carrying amounts in our balance sheets. For financial instruments recognized at fair value, GAAP requires the disclosure of their fair values by type of instrument, along with other information, including changes in the fair values of certain financial instruments recognized in income or other comprehensive income, and this information is provided below under Recurring Fair Value Measurements.For financial instruments not recognized at fair value, the disclosure of their fair values is provided below under Other Financial Instruments.Nonfinancial assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and nonfinancial liabilities are recognized at their carrying amounts in our balance sheets. GAAP does not permit nonfinancial assets and liabilities to be remeasured at their fair values. However, GAAP requires the remeasurement of such assets and liabilities to their fair values upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the impairment of property, plant and equipment. In addition, if such an event occurs, GAAP requires the disclosure of the fair value of the asset or liability along with other information, including the gain or loss recognized in income in the period the remeasurement occurred. This information is provided below under Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.GAAP provides a framework for measuring fair value and establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques based on the degree to which objective prices in external active markets are available to measure fair value. Following is a description of each of the levels of the fair value hierarchy.Level 1- Observable inputs, such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2- Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.Level 3- Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for which there is little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability. The inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which might include occasional market quotes or sales of similar instruments or our own financial data such as internally developed pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, as well as instruments for which the fair value determination requires significant judgment.The financial instruments and nonfinancial assets and liabilities included in our disclosure of recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements are categorized according to the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure their fair values120Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedRecurring Fair Value MeasurementsThe tables below present information in millions about our financial instruments recognized at their fair values in our balance sheets categorized according to the fair value hierarchy of the inputs utilized by us to determine the fair values as of December31, 2012and 2011.Cash collateral deposits of $127 millionand $136 millionwith brokers under master netting arrangements are included in the fair value of the commodity derivatives reflected in Level 1 as of December31, 2012and 2011, respectively. Certain of our commodity derivative contracts under master netting arrangements include both asset and liability positions. We have elected to offset the fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty, including any related cash collateral asset or obligation under the column Netting Adjustments below; however, fair value amounts by hierarchy level are presented on a gross basis in the tables below.Fair Value Measurements UsingQuotedPrices inActiveMarketsLevel   3NettingAdjustmentsTotal as ofDecember 31,2012Assets:Commodity derivative  purchase contracts1111Investments of certain benefit plans871198Foreign currency contracts11Other  derivative  blending obligation1010Foreign currency contracts11121Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedFair Value Measurements UsingQuotedPrices inActiveMarketsLevel   3NettingAdjustmentsTotal as ofDecember 31,2011Assets:Commodity derivative  purchase contracts22Investments of certain benefit plans841195Other  derivative  currency contracts33A description of our financial instruments and the valuation methods used to measure those instruments at fair value are as follows:Commodity derivative contracts consist primarily of exchange-traded futures and swaps, and as disclosed in Note 21, some of these contracts are designated as hedging instruments. These contracts are measured at fair value using the market approach. Exchange-traded futures are valued based on quoted prices from the exchange and are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Swaps are priced using third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services, and exchange-traded curves, with appropriate consideration of counterparty credit risk, but because they have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange-traded futures instruments with a comparable market price, these financial instruments are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.Physical purchase contracts to purchase inventories represent the fair value of firm commitments to purchase crude oil feedstocks and the fair value of fixed-price corn purchase contracts, and as disclosed in Note 21, some of these contracts are designated as hedging instruments. The fair values of these firm commitments and purchase contracts are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices from the commodity exchange, but because these commitments have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange-traded futures instruments with a comparable market price, they are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.Investments of certain benefit plans consist of investment securities held by trusts for the purpose of satisfying a portion of our obligations under certain U.S. nonqualified benefit plans. The assets categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy are measured at fair value using a market approach based on quotations from national securities exchanges. The assets categorized in Level3 of the fair value hierarchy represent insurance contracts, the fair value of which is provided by the insurer.Other investments consist of i equity securities of private companies over which we do not exercise significant influence nor whose financial statements are consolidated into our financial statements and ii debt securities of a private company whose financial statements are not consolidated into our financial statements. We have elected to account for these investments at their fair values. These investments are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the fair values of these investments are determined using the income approach based on internally developed analyses122Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedOur biofuels blending obligation represents a liability for the purchase of RINs and RTFCs, as defined and described in Note 21under Compliance Program Price Risk,to satisfy our obligation to blend biofuels into the products we produce. Our obligation is based on our deficiency in RINs and RTFCs and the price of these instruments as of the balance sheet date. Our obligation is categorized in Level1 of the fair value hierarchy and is measured at fair value using the market approach based on quoted prices from an independent pricing service.During the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010there were no transfers between assets classified as Level 1 and Level 2.The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances in millions for fair value measurements developed using significant unobservable inputs Level 3.Investments ofCertainBenefit PlansOther  as of beginning of  losses included in refining operating expense211Transfers in and/or out of Level 3Balance as of end of year$11$11$10 The amount of total losses included in income attributable to the change in unrealized losses relating to assets still held at end of year 21$1Nonrecurring Fair Value MeasurementsThe table below presents the fair value in millions of our nonfinancial assets measured on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December31, 2012.Fair Value Measurements UsingTotal LossRecognizedDuring theYear EndedDecember 31,2012QuotedPrices inActiveMarketsLevel   3TotalFair Valueas of December 31, 2012Assets:Long-lived assets of the Aruba Refinery 903Materials and suppliesinventories ofthe Aruba Refinery25Cancelled capital projects2265Property, plant and equipment ofconvenience stores8821123Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedAs of December31, 2012, there were noliabilities that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. As of December31, 2011, there were no assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.Aruba RefineryAs more fully described in Note 4, in September 2012, we decided to reorganize the Aruba Refinery into a crude oil and refined products terminal in response to the August 2012 withdrawal of a non-binding offer to purchase the refinery. As a result, we evaluated the refining assets for potential impairment as of September30, 2012. We concluded that these refining assets were impaired and determined that their carrying value was not recoverable through the future operations and disposition of the refinery. We determined that these refining assets had no value after considering estimated salvage costs. We also recognized an asset impairment loss related to materials and supplies inventories that supported the refining operations. Cancelled Capital ProjectsDuring 2012 and 2010, we wrote down the carrying value of equipment associated with permanently cancelled capital projects at several of our refineries and recognized asset impairment losses of $65 millionand $2million, respectively.Retail StoresDuring 2012, we evaluated certain of our convenience stores operated by our retail segment for potential impairment and concluded that they were impaired, and we wrote down the carrying values of these stores to their estimated fair values and recognized asset impairment losses of $21million.Other Financial InstrumentsFinancial instruments that we recognize in our balance sheets at their carrying amounts are shown in the table below in millions:December31, 2012December31,  assets:Cash and temporary cash  liabilities:Debt excluding capital  methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments are as follows:The fair value of cash and temporary cash investments approximates the carrying value due to the low level of credit risk of these assets combined with their short maturities and market interest rates Level 1.The fair value of debt is determined primarily using the market approach based on quoted prices provided by third-party brokers and vendor pricing services, but are not exchange-traded Level2124Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued21.PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIESWe are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of commodities, the price of financial instruments associated with governmental and regulatory compliance programs, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates, and we enter into derivative instruments to manage some of these risks. We also enter into derivative instruments to manage the price risk on other contractual derivatives into which we have entered. The only types of derivative instruments we enter into are those related to the various commodities we purchase or produce, financial instruments we must purchase to maintain compliance with various governmental and regulatory programs, interest rate swaps, and foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts, as described below. All derivative instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair values see Note20.When we enter into a derivative instrument, it is designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, an economic hedge, or a trading derivative. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, is recognized currently in income in the same period. The effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is then recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in income as incurred. For our economic hedges derivative instruments not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges and for derivative instruments entered into by us for trading purposes, the derivative instrument is recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized currently in income. The cash flow effects of all of our derivative instruments are reflected in operating activities in our statements of cash flows for all periods presented125Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedCommodity Price RiskWe are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined products primarily gasoline and distillate, grain primarily corn, and natural gas used in our operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, and options. We use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our hedging and trading operations. We use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.For risk management purposes, we use fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, and economic hedges. In addition to the use of derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk, we also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes. Our objective for entering into each type of hedge or trading derivative is described below.Fair Value HedgesFair value hedges are used to hedge price volatility in certain refining inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories. The level of activity for our fair value hedges is based on the level of our operating inventories, and generally represents the amount by which our inventories differ from our previous year-end LIFO inventory levels.As of December31, 2012, we had the following outstanding commodity derivative instruments that were entered into to hedge crude oil and refined product inventories and commodity derivative instruments related to the physical purchase of crude oil and refined products at a fixed price.

The objective of our cash flow hedges is to lock in the price of forecasted feedstock, product or natural gas purchases, or refined product sales at existing market prices that we deem favorable.As of December31, 2012, we had the following outstanding commodity derivative instruments that were entered into to hedge forecasted purchases or sales of crude oil and refined products.

Our objective for entering into economic hedges is consistent with the objectives discussed above for fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. However, the economic hedges are not designated as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes, usually due to the difficulty of establishing the required documentation at the date that the derivative instrument is entered into that would allow us to achieve hedge deferral accounting.As of December31, 2012, we had the following outstanding commodity derivative instruments that were entered into as economic hedges and commodity derivative instruments related to the physical purchase of corn at a fixed price. The information presents the notional volume of outstanding contracts by type of instrument and year of maturity volumes in thousands of barrels, except those identified as natural gas contracts that are presented in billions of British thermal units and corn contracts that are presented in thousands of bushels.Notional Contract Volumes byYear of MaturityDerivative Instrument20132014Crude oil and refined products:Swaps long1,687Swaps short895Futures long48,109Futures short63,769Options long10Natural gas:Options long16,750Corn:Futures long13,9955Futures short28,68025Physical contracts long16,37829128Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedTrading DerivativesOur objective for entering into commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes is to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows.As of December31, 2012, we had the following outstanding commodity derivative instruments that were entered into for trading purposes.

These programs are described below.Obligation to Blend BiofuelsWe are obligated to blend biofuels into the products we produce in most of the countries in which we operate, and these countries set annual quotas for the percentage of biofuels that must be blended into the motor fuels consumed in these countries. As a producer of motor fuels from petroleum, we are obligated to blend biofuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least equal to the applicable quota. To the degree we are unable to blend at the applicable rate in the U.S. and the U.K., we must purchase Renewable Identification Numbers RINs in the U.S. and Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation certificates RTFCs in the U.K., and as such, we are exposed to the volatility in the market price of these financial instruments. We have not 129Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedentered into derivative instruments to manage this risk, but we purchase RINs and RTFCs when the price of these instruments is deemed favorable. For the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, the cost of meeting our obligations under these compliance programs was $250million, $231million, and $66million, respectively, and these amounts are reflected in cost of sales.Maintaining Minimum Inventory QuantitiesIn the U.K., we are required to maintain a minimum quantity of crude oil and refined products as a reserve against shortages or interruptions in the supply of these products. To the degree we decide not to physically hold the minimum quantity of crude oil and refined products, we must purchase Compulsory Stock Obligation CSO tickets from other suppliers of refined products in the U.K. or other European Union EU member countries, and we make economic decisions as to the cost of maintaining certain quantities of crude oil and refined products versus the cost of purchasing CSO tickets. We have not entered into derivative instruments to manage the price volatility of CSO tickets. For the years ended December31, 2012and 2011, the cost of purchasing CSO tickets to help meet our obligations under this compliance program was $8millionand $4million, respectively, and these amounts were reflected in cost of sales. We had no obligations under this compliance program prior to completing the Pembroke Acquisition in 2011.Emission AllowancesOur Pembroke Refinery is subject to a maximum amount of carbon dioxide that it can emit each year under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. Under this cap-and-trade program, we purchase emission allowances on the open market for the difference between the amount of carbon dioxide emitted and the maximum amount allowed under the program. Therefore, we are exposed to the volatility in the market price of these allowances. For the years ended December31, 2012and 2011, the cost of meeting our obligation under this compliance program was immaterial. We had no obligations under this compliance program prior to completing the Pembroke Acquisition in 2011.We enter into derivative instruments futures to reduce the impact of this risk on our results of operations and cash flows. Our positions in these derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.As of December31, 2012, we had no futures contracts outstanding related to this compliance program. As of December31, 2011, we had purchased futures contracts long for 68,000metric tons of EU emission allowances that were entered into as economic hedges. As of December31, 2011, the fair value of these futures contracts was immaterial and therefore not separately presented in the table below under Fair Values of Derivative Instruments.For the year ended December31, 2011, the loss recognized in income on these derivative instruments designated as economic hedges was also immaterial and therefore not separately presented in the table below under Effect of Derivative Instruments on Statements of Income and Other Comprehensive Income. Interest Rate RiskOur primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our debt obligations. We manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. In addition, at times we have used interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixed to floating interest rate position by converting certain fixed-rate debt to floating-rate debt. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December31, 2012and 2011, or during the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, or 2010130Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedForeign Currency RiskWe are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions entered into by our international operations that are denominated in currencies other than the local functional currencies of these operations. To manage our exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations, we use foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes, and therefore they are classified as economic hedges. As of December31, 2012, we had commitments to purchase $552millionof U.S. dollars. These commitments matured on or before January31, 2013resulting in a gain of $1millionin the first quarter of 2013131Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedFair Values of Derivative InstrumentsThe following tables provide information about the fair values of our derivative instruments as of December31, 2012and 2011in millions and the line items in the balance sheets in which the fair values are reflected. See Note20for additional information related to the fair values of our derivative instruments.As indicated in Note20, we net fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under master netting arrangements. The tables below, however, are presented on a gross asset and gross liability basis, which results in the reflection of certain assets in liability accounts and certain liabilities in asset accounts. In addition, in Note20, we included cash collateral on deposit with or received from brokers in the fair value of the commodity derivatives; these cash amounts are not reflected in the tables below.Balance SheetLocationDecember31,  designated ashedging instrumentsCommodity contracts:FuturesReceivables, net$77$64SwapsReceivables, net1513SwapsPrepaid expenses and other22Total$94$79Derivatives not designated ashedging instrumentsCommodity contracts:FuturesReceivables,  net96SwapsAccrued  net14OptionsAccrued expenses1Physical purchase contractsInventories11Foreign currency contractsReceivables, net1Foreign currency contractsAccrued   of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedBalance SheetLocationDecember31,  designated ashedging instrumentsCommodity contracts:FuturesReceivables, net$264$240SwapsAccrued  not designated ashedging instrumentsCommodity contracts:FuturesReceivables, net$1,636$1,624SwapsPrepaid expenses and other42SwapsAccrued  net2OptionsAccrued expenses2Physical purchase contractsInventories2Foreign currency contractsAccrued  derivatives$1,980$1,970Market and Counterparty RiskOur price risk management activities involve the receipt or payment of fixed price commitments into the future. These transactions give rise to market risk, which is the risk that future changes in market conditions may make an instrument less valuable. We closely monitor and manage our exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors. Market risks are monitored by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy. Concentrations of customers in the refining industry may impact our overall exposure to counterparty risk because these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, financial services companies are the counterparties in certain of our price risk management activities, and such financial services companies may be adversely affected by periods of uncertainty and illiquidity in the credit and capital markets.There were no material amounts due from counterparties in the refining or financial services industry as of December31, 2012or 2011. These amounts represent the aggregate amount payable to us by companies in those industries, reduced by payables from us to those companies under master netting arrangements that allow for the setoff of amounts receivable from and payable to the same party. We do not require any collateral or other security to support derivative instruments into which we enter. We also do not have any derivative instruments that require us to maintain a minimum investment-grade credit rating133Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedEffect of Derivative Instruments on Statements of Income and Other Comprehensive IncomeThe following tables provide information about the gain or loss recognized in income and other comprehensive income OCI on our derivative instruments and the line items in the financial statements in which such gains and losses are reflected in millions.Derivatives in Fair ValueHedging RelationshipsLocation of Gain LossRecognized in Incomeon DerivativesYear Ended December 31,201220112010Commodity contracts:Gain loss recognized inincome on derivativesCost of sales$250$6$45Gain loss recognized inincome on hedged itemCost of sales1832340Gain loss recognized inincome on derivativesineffective portionCost of sales67295For fair value hedges, no component of the derivative instruments gains or losses was excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010. We recognized a gain of $28 millionin income for hedged firm commitments that no longer qualified as fair value hedges during the year ended December31, 2012. No amounts were recognized in income for hedged firm commitments that no longer qualified as fair value hedges for the years ended December31, 2011and 2010.Derivatives in Cash FlowHedging RelationshipsLocation of Gain LossRecognized in Incomeon DerivativesYear Ended December 31,201220112010Commodity contracts:Gain loss recognized inOCI on derivativeseffective portion$45$32$2Gain reclassified fromaccumulated OCI intoincome effective portionCost of sales733178Gain recognized inincome on derivativesineffective portionCost of sales485For cash flow hedges, no component of the derivative instruments gains or losses was excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010. For the year ended December31, 2012, cash flow hedges primarily related to forward sales of gasoline and distillates, and associated forward purchases of crude oil, with $1millionof cumulative after-tax gains on cash flow hedges remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income. We estimate that $1millionof the deferred gain as of December31, 2012will be reclassified into cost of sales over the next 12 months as a result of hedged transactions that are forecasted to occur. For the years ended December31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, there were no amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting134Table of ContentsVALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedDerivatives Designated as Economic Hedges and OtherDerivative InstrumentsLocation of Gain LossRecognized in Incomeon DerivativesYear Ended December 31,201220112010Commodity contractsCost of sales$1$349$210Foreign currency contractsCost of sales381824Other contractCost of  gain of $29millionon the other contract for the year ended December31, 2011is related to the difference between the fair value of inventories acquired in connection with the Pembroke Acquisition and the amount paid for such inventories based on the terms of the purchase agreement.
