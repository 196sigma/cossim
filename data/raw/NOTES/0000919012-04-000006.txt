Overview
American Eagle Outfitters, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a
leading lifestyle retailer that designs, markets and sells our own brand of
relaxed, casual clothing for 15 to 25 year olds, providing high-quality
merchandise at affordable prices. We opened our first American Eagle Outfitters
store in the United States in 1977 and expanded the brand into Canada in 2001.
We also distribute merchandise via our e-commerce business as well as through
our catalog. Our collection offers modern basics like jeans, cargo pants, and
graphic T as well as a stylish assortment of cool accessories, outerwear and
footwear under our American Eagle Outfitters and AE brand names. 
We also operate the Bluenotes/Thriftys specialty apparel
chain in Canada. The Bluenotes/Thriftys brand targets a slightly younger
demographic, offering a more urban/suburban, denim-driven collection for 12 to
22 year olds.
As of January 31, 2004, we operated 805 American Eagle
Outfitters stores in the United States and Canada and 110 Bluenotes/Thriftys
stores in Canada. 
As used in this report, all references to we, our, and
the Company refer to American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. The
term American Eagle refers to our U.S. and Canadian American Eagle Outfitters
stores and the Company e-commerce business as well as our catalog. Bluenotes
refers to the Bluenotes/Thriftys specialty apparel chain in Canada.
Information concerning the Company business segments and
certain geographic information is contained in Note 11 of the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by
reference. Organization On April 13, 1994, the Company successfully completed an
initial public offering of its common stock. Our stock is traded on the Nasdaq
National Market under the symbol AEOS. 
In November 2000, we acquired three businesses in Canada -
the Bluenotes chain, an established Canadian brand; the Braemar chain, with
excellent real estate in prime mall locations, of which 46 were converted to
American Eagle stores during Fiscal 2001; and National Logistics Services NLS,
a 400,000 square foot distribution center near Toronto, which handles all of the
distribution needs for our Canadian operations and provides services to third
parties.
Our financial year is a 52/53 week year that ends on the
Saturday nearest to January 31. As used herein, Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and
Fiscal 2001 refer to the fifty-two week periods ended January 31, 2004,
February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002, respectively. Fiscal 2004 refers to the
fifty-two week period ending January 29, 2005. 
Store Growth
American Eagle 
Our primary American Eagle store growth strategy is to
continue our expansion throughout the United States by filling in existing
markets. We currently operate in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto
Rico. We opened 43 net new U.S. stores during Fiscal 2003, increasing our U.S.
store base by approximately 6%. Additionally, our U.S. gross square footage
increased by over 10% during Fiscal 2003 due to the new store openings as well
as incremental square footage from 65 U.S. store renovations. 
During Fiscal 2003, we continued to grow rapidly in the
western U.S. with 50% of our store openings in that region. We added nine new
stores in California, a market with strong demographics for our target customer.
We also entered two new markets, Hawaii, where we opened four stores, and San
Juan, Puerto Rico, where we opened one store. Our performance is very strong in
these new markets and we will continue to explore similar opportunities for new
store growth. 
2 Our research has shown that there are still attractive retail
locations where we can open American Eagle stores in both enclosed regional
malls and urban and lifestyle centers, leaving us with several years of solid
growth opportunity within the United States. During Fiscal 2003, we opened nine American Eagle stores in
Canada and remodeled one store location. We remain pleased with the results of
our American Eagle expansion into Canada and look to a long-term potential of
approximately 80 stores across the country. We also plan to enter the province
of Quebec during Fiscal 2004 with at least four new store locations.

Eagle store growth

Bluenotes The Company operated 110 Bluenotes stores throughout Canada
at the end of Fiscal 2003, a decrease of one store from the prior year.
Approximately 50% of Bluenotes stores are in the province of Ontario. 
Remodel Opportunities 
The Company continues to remodel older and smaller stores
into its new store format, which better reflects the American Eagle brand image.
In order to maintain a balanced presentation and to accommodate additional
product categories, we selectively enlarge our stores during the remodeling
process. In most cases we expand stores from an average of 4,000 gross square
feet to an average of 6,000 gross square feet. We believe the larger format can
better accommodate our new merchandise categories and support future growth. In
many cases, we also upgrade the store location within the mall. We remodeled 65
U.S. stores during Fiscal 2003 to the new store design. As of January 31, 2004,
approximately two-thirds of all American Eagle stores in the U.S. are in our new
store format. 
Store Locations Our American Eagle stores average approximately 5,300 gross
square feet and approximately 4,300 on a selling square foot basis. At January
31, 2004, we operated 805 American Eagle stores in the United States and Canada
as shown below United States, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico

Purchasing The Company purchases merchandise from suppliers who either
manufacture their own merchandise or supply merchandise manufactured by others,
or both. During Fiscal 2003, both American Eagle and Bluenotes purchased a
majority of their merchandise from non-North American suppliers. 
All of our American Eagle suppliers receive a vendor
compliance manual that describes our quality standards and shipping
instructions. We maintain a quality control department at our distribution
center to inspect incoming merchandise shipments for uniformity of sizes and
colors, and for overall quality of manufacturing. Periodic quality inspections
are also made by our employees at manufacturing facilities in the United States
and internationally to identify potential problems prior to shipment of
merchandise. Additionally, our merchant group works directly with many factories
to address quality control issues before merchandise is shipped. Global Labor Compliance The Company is firmly committed to the goal of using only the
most highly regarded and efficient suppliers throughout the world. We require
our suppliers to provide a workplace environment that not only meets basic human
rights standards, but also one that complies with all local legal requirements
and encourages opportunity for all, with dignity and respect.
For many years, we have had a policy for the inspection of
factories throughout the world where goods are produced to our order. This
inspection process is important for quality control purposes, as well as customs
compliance and human rights standards. During Fiscal 2001, we strengthened and
formalized the process by developing and implementing a comprehensive vendor
compliance program with the assistance of an internationally recognized
consulting firm. This program contractually requires all suppliers to meet our
global workplace standards, including human rights standards, as set forth in
our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct is required to be posted in all
factories in the local language. The program utilizes third party inspectors to
audit compliance by vendor factories with our workplace standards and Code of
Conduct. Merchandise Inventory, Replenishment and Distribution Purchase orders, executed by our American Eagle buyers for
the U.S. stores, are entered into the merchandise system at the time of order.
Merchandise is normally shipped directly from vendors, split after clearing
customs, and routed to our two distribution centers, one in Warrendale, PA and
the other in Ottawa, KS. Upon receipt, merchandise is entered into the
merchandise system, then processed and prepared for shipment to the stores or
forwarded to a warehouse holding area to be used as store replenishment goods.
The allocation of merchandise among stores varies based upon a number of
factors, including geographic location, customer demographics and store size.
These factors impact anticipated sales volume and the quantity and mix of
merchandise allocated to stores. Merchandise is shipped to the stores two to
five times per week depending upon the season and store requirements. Ae.com,
the Company e-commerce business, uses a third-party vendor for its fulfillment
services.
American Eagle stores in Canada and Bluenotes stores receive
merchandise from NLS, our Canadian distribution network which consists of a
400,000 square foot central distribution center near Toronto, and four smaller
sub-centers across Canada totaling approximately 65,000 square feet. Merchandise
is shipped to the stores two to five times per week depending upon the season
and store requirements.
4 To support new store growth, over the past several years, we
have improved our primary distribution facilities by installing a new warehouse
management system, which makes the distribution process more efficient and
productive. Additionally, to support our geographical expansion into the
Northwest and Southwest, we purchased and expanded an existing distribution
center in Ottawa, Kansas, which was opened in June 2001. This facility comprises
approximately 400,000 square feet and will support our continuing store growth
in the western U.S. This second facility increases our potential capacity to
roughly 1,100 stores and gives the Company one or two day shipping times to
approximately 85% of our stores. We also operate a facility near Puebla, Mexico,
which supports our knit and denim production with warehousing, deconsolidation,
product development and testing, quality control, and other value added
services. Customer Credit and Returns We offer our U.S. customers an American Eagle private label
credit card, issued by a third-party bank. We have no liability to the card
issuer for bad debt expense, provided that purchases are made in accordance with
the issuing banks' procedures. We believe that providing in-store credit through
use of our proprietary credit card promotes incremental sales and encourages
customer loyalty. Our credit card holders receive special promotional offers and
advance notice of all in-store sales events. The names and addresses of these
preferred customers are added to our customer database, which is used primarily
for direct mail purposes. American Eagle customers in the U.S. and Canada
may also pay for their purchases with American Express, Discover, MasterCard,
Visa, bank debit cards, cash or check. Bluenotes customers may pay for their
purchases with American Express, MasterCard, Visa, bank debit cards or cash. Additionally, gift cards can be purchased in our American
Eagle stores in the U.S. and Canada and our Bluenotes stores. When the recipient
uses the gift card, the value of the purchase is electronically deducted from
the card and any remaining value can be used for future purchases. If a gift
card remains inactive for greater than twenty-four months, the Company assesses
the recipient a one dollar per month service fee, where allowed by law, which is
automatically deducted from the remaining value of the card. This service fee is
recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses on the Company
Consolidated Statements of Operations.
We offer our customers a hassle-free return policy. The
Company believes that certain of its competitors offer similar credit card and
service policies. Competition The retail apparel industry is very competitive. We compete
primarily on the basis of quality, fashion, service, selection and price.
American Eagle stores in the U.S. compete with various divisions of The Limited,
The Gap, Abercrombie Fitch and Pacific Sunwear as well as with retail chains
such as Aeropostale, The Buckle and other national, regional and local retailers
catering to a youthful customer. We also compete with the casual apparel and
footwear departments of department stores and discount retailers. 
American Eagle and Bluenotes stores in Canada compete with a
variety of national specialty retail chains, a number of independent retailers
and casual clothing shops within department stores, as well as various divisions
of The Gap. Trademarks and Service Marks We have registered American Eagle Outfitters in the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office PTO as a trademark for clothing and for a
variety of non-clothing products, including jewelry, perfume, and personal care
products, and as a service mark for retail clothing stores and credit card
services. We have also registered AE for clothing and footwear products and an
application is pending to register AE for a variety of non-clothing items. We
have also registered a number of other marks used in our business. 
We have registered American Eagle Outfitters,
Thriftys,
and Bluenotes
in the Canadian Trademark Offices for a wide variety of clothing products, as
well as for retail clothing store services. In addition, we are exclusively
licensed in Canada to use AE
and AEO in
connection with the sale of a wide range of clothing products.
5 Employees 
As of January 31, 2004, we had approximately 13,900 employees
in the United States, of whom 2,800 were full-time salaried employees, 900 were
full-time hourly employees and 10,200 were part-time and seasonal hourly
employees. In Canada, as part of our American Eagle, Bluenotes and NLS
operations, we had 3,500 employees, of whom 600 were full-time salaried

seasonal hourly employees. We consider our relationship with our employees to be
satisfactory. Available Information

ITEM 2.PROPERTIES. 
We rent our headquarters and distribution facility near
Pittsburgh, PA from Linmar Realty Company, an affiliate of the Company and of
Schottenstein Stores Corporation see Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial
Statements for a detailed description of the Company relationship with Linmar
Realty Company. Our headquarters and distribution center occupy approximately
490,000 square feet, 120,000 square feet of which is used for executive,
administrative and buying offices. This lease expires on December 31, 2020. We
also lease additional office and storage space near our headquarters totaling
38,000 square feet. These leases expire in March 2005 and August 2009,
respectively. 
The Company rents office space at 401 Fifth Avenue in New
York for our designers, sourcing, and production team. This lease, for
approximately 48,000 square feet, expires in May 2016. The previous office
space, of approximately 18,000 square feet, at 485 Fifth Avenue in New York, NY
is currently under a sublease. The lease and sublease expire in December 2008. Bluenotes rents its headquarters, consisting of approximately
40,000 square feet, in Toronto, Ontario. The lease expires in February 2007. 
We purchased an existing 290,000 square foot distribution
facility in Ottawa, Kansas that opened in June 2001. This facility was expanded
to approximately 400,000 square feet during Fiscal 2001. Through our Canadian
acquisition, we purchased NLS, a 400,000 square foot distribution facility near
Toronto, which is also used for the American Eagle Canada administrative
offices. Additionally, we rent four smaller distribution sub-centers across
Canada as part of NLS with a total of approximately 65,000 square feet. These
sub-center leases expire with various terms through 2009. A warehousing and
deconsolidation facility and office near Puebla, Mexico of approximately 94,300
square feet is also leased until 2005.
All of our stores in the United States and Canada are leased.
The store leases generally have initial terms of 10 years. Some leases also
include early termination options which can be exercised under specific
conditions. Most of these leases provide for base rent and require the payment
of a percentage of sales as additional rent when sales reach specified levels.
Under our store leases, we are typically responsible for maintenance and common
area charges, real estate taxes and certain other expenses. We have generally
been successful in negotiating renewals as leases near expiration. 6 ITEM 3.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. We are subject to various claims and legal actions that arise
in the ordinary course of our business. We believe that such claims and legal
actions, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse
effect on our business or our financial condition. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and

9 ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations are based upon the Company Consolidated Financial
Statements and should be read in conjunction with those statements and notes
thereto. Critical Accounting Policies The consolidated financial statements are prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the
reported financial condition and results of operations should actual results
differ. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on the best available
information and believes them to be reasonable for the circumstances. The
Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following
involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. See also Note 2 of the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition. The Company records revenue for
store sales upon the purchase of merchandise by customers. The Company
e-commerce and catalog business records revenue at the time the goods are
shipped. Revenue is not recorded on the purchase of gift cards. A current
liability is recorded upon purchase and revenue is recognized when the gift card
is redeemed for merchandise. Revenue is recorded net of sales returns. 
Revenue is not recorded on the sell-off of end-of-season,
overstock and irregular merchandise to off-price retailers. These sell-offs are
typically sold below cost and the proceeds are reflected in cost of sales. See
Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Inventory. Merchandise inventory is valued at the lower
of average cost or market, utilizing the retail method. Average cost includes
merchandise design and sourcing costs and related expenses.
The Company reviews its inventory levels in order to identify
slow-moving merchandise and generally uses markdowns to clear merchandise. If
inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style, seasonal adaptation,
changes in customer preference, lack of consumer acceptance of fashion items,
competition, or if it is determined that the inventory in stock will not sell at
its currently ticketed price, additional markdowns may be necessary. These
markdowns have an adverse impact on earnings, which may or may not be material,
depending on the extent and amount of inventory affected. The Company also
estimates a shrinkage reserve for the period between the last physical count and
the balance sheet date. The estimate for the shrinkage reserve can be affected
by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends. Asset Impairment. The Company is required to test for
asset impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable. The Company applies SFAS
No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,
in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired. Management evaluates
the ongoing value of assets associated with retail stores that have been open
longer than one year. Assets are evaluated for impairment when undiscounted
future cash flows are projected to be less than the carrying value of those
assets. When events such as these occur, the assets are adjusted to estimated
fair value and an impairment loss is recorded in selling, general and
administrative expenses. Should actual results or market conditions differ from
those anticipated, additional losses may be recorded. Goodwill. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets, management evaluates goodwill for impairment by
comparing the fair value of the Company reporting units to the book value.
The fair value of the Company reporting units is estimated using a discounted
cash flow model. Based on the analysis, if the implied fair value of each
reporting unit exceeds the book value of the goodwill, no impairment loss is
recognized. 
During the three months ended November 1, 2003, the Company
believed that certain indicators of impairment were present related to the
Bluenotes goodwill. As a result, the Company performed an interim test of
impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142. The Company completed step one
and determined that impairment was likely, which also required the completion of
step two. Due to the significant assumptions required for this test, the
Company retained an independent third party to perform a step two analysis and
to validate Management assumptions used in step one. Although the third
party valuation was still pending as of November 1, 2003 10 Management believed
that a loss was probable and determined its best estimate at that time in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, as supplemented by SFAS No. 5,
Accounting for Contingencies. As a result, the Company recorded an
$80 million estimated impairment loss during the three months ended November 1,
2003. 
During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003, the independent
third party valuation of the Bluenotes reporting unit was completed. Based upon
the step one analysis, it was concluded that the fair market value of the
Bluenotes reporting unit was below the book value of the business. The Company
completed the step two analysis and allocated the fair value, as determined by
the valuation firm, to the existing assets and liabilities and determined that
the remaining carrying value of the goodwill was impaired. As a result, the
Company recorded an additional $61 million loss during the fourth quarter of
Fiscal 2003. As of January 31, 2004, the book value related to the Bluenotes
goodwill was zero. See Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further discussion. Income Taxes. The Company calculates income taxes in
accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires
the use of the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the
consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using the tax rates in effect in the years when those temporary
differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is established
against the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred taxes may not be realized. Legal Proceedings and Claims. The Company is subject to
certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of the conduct of its business.
In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, Management
records a reserve for estimated losses when the amount is probable and can be
reasonably estimated. If a range of possible loss exists, the Company records
the accrual at the low end of the range, in accordance with FIN 14, an
interpretation of SFAS No. 5. As the Company has provided adequate reserves, it
believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the
Company will not materially affect the financial position of the Company. 
Results of Operations
Overview
Fiscal 2003 was a challenging year. Our merchandise
assortments were not clearly focused on our target customers, resulting in
negative comparable store sales. Higher markdowns and increased promotional
activity were necessary to clear through the inventory units. This resulted in a
lower average unit retail price, which was the primary driver of the decline in
comparable store sales.
Consolidated net sales for Fiscal 2003 increased 39% to
$1520 billion from $1463 billion for Fiscal 2002, while our consolidated
comparable store sales decreased 67% compared to the corresponding period last
year. 
Gross profit as a percent to sales declined to 365% for
Fiscal 2003 from 371% for the same period last year. The decline in our gross
profit margin was primarily due to the deleveraging of rent expense as a result
of weak comparable store sales. We were also not able to leverage selling,
general and administrative expenses as a result of the negative comp store
sales, which increased from 240% to 250%, as a percent to sales.
During Fiscal 2003, we recognized a $141 million goodwill
impairment charge due to the continued weak performance of the Bluenotes
segment. Reported net income for Fiscal 2003, which includes the goodwill
impairment charge, decreased to $600 million, or $083 per diluted share.
Adjusted net income*, which excludes the goodwill impairment charge, decreased
to $741 million, or $103 per diluted share, compared to $887 million, or
$122 per diluted share in the prior year. 
Despite a challenging year, we ended Fiscal 2003 with $3378
million in cash and short-term investments, an increase of $962 million from
last year. And we continued to make significant investments in our business,
including approximately $642 million in capital expenditures, which related
primarily to our new and remodeled American Eagle stores in the U.S. and Canada.
11 In response to disappointing results, we made a number of
changes throughout the Company. We upgraded our merchandising and design
process, and added new creative talent in key positions. Across operating
functions, we focused on improving productivity and strengthened operating
disciplines. And importantly, during Fiscal 2003, we interviewed over 3,000 of
our customers. This research led to adjustments to our product line. Going
forward, our merchandise assortments are planned to be clearly targeted at our
15 to 25 year old customers, with a strong value message and an emphasis on key
items. A complete definition and discussion of the Company use of
non-GAAP measures, identified by an asterisk *, is located below.
This table shows, for the periods indicated, the percentage
relationship to net sales of the listed items included in the Company
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company has two reportable segments, American Eagle and
Bluenotes. The American Eagle segment includes the Company 805 U.S. and
Canadian retail stores, the Company e-commerce business, ae.com, as well as
the Company catalog business. The Bluenotes segment includes the Company 110
Bluenotes/Thriftys stores in Canada. 
Comparison of Fiscal 2003 to Fiscal 2002
Net Sales
Consolidated net sales increased 39% to $1520 billion from
$1463 billion. The sales increase was due to a 101% increase in gross square
feet, consisting primarily of the addition of 51 net new stores offset by a
consolidated comparable store sales decline of 67%.
American Eagle net sales increased 38% to $1435 billion
from $1383 billion. The sales increase was due to an 111% increase in gross
square feet, consisting primarily of the addition of 52 net new stores, offset
by a comparable store sales decline of 66%. The comparable store sales decrease
was driven by a lower average unit retail price as well as a decline in the
number of transactions per average store, while the number of units sold per
average store increased compared to a year ago. Comparable store sales in the
women business declined in the mid single-digits for the period while the
men comparable store sales decreased in the low double-digits.
Bluenotes net sales increased 54% to $845 million from
$802 million due to a stronger Canadian dollar during the period compared to
the same period last year. Comparable store sales, which exclude the impact of
foreign currency fluctuations, decreased 73% due primarily to a lower average
unit retail price partially offset by an increase in the number of transactions
per average store, the number of units per transaction and the number of units
sold per average store. 
12 A store is included in comparable store sales in the
thirteenth month of operation. However, stores that have a gross square footage
increase of 25% or greater due to an expansion and/or relocation are removed
from the comparable store sales base, but are included in total sales. These
stores are returned to the comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month
following the expansion and/or relocation. 
Gross Profit
Gross profit as a percent to net sales declined to 365% from
371%. The percentage decrease was attributed to the deleveraging of buying,
occupancy and warehousing costs offset by an improvement in merchandise margins.
By segment, American Eagle contributed to the decline in gross margin as a
percent to sales, while Bluenotes had a positive impact. 
Buying, occupancy and warehousing expenses deleveraged due
primarily to the deleveraging of rent expense at the American Eagle stores. As a
percent to consolidated net sales, Bluenotes buying, occupancy and warehousing
expenses remained relatively flat. 
Merchandise margins increased for the period due primarily to
an improved markon at both segments offset by increased markdowns at American
Eagle stores as well as an increase in the liquidation of sell-off merchandise
at both American Eagle and Bluenotes. Additionally, a reduction in the American
Eagle stores sales returns reserve contributed to the higher merchandise
margins.
The Company gross profit may not be comparable to that of
other retailers, as some retailers include all costs related to their
distribution network as well as design costs in cost of sales and others may
exclude a portion of these costs from cost of sales, including them in a line
item such as selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 2 of the
Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company accounting
policy regarding cost of sales, including certain buying, occupancy and
warehousing expenses.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent to
net sales increased to 250% from 240% due primarily to the deleveraging of
compensation at both the American Eagle and Bluenotes stores. Compensation
deleveraged due primarily to the 67% decline in comparable store sales.
Insurance expense deleveraged at American Eagle and store impairment expense
deleveraged at both American Eagle and Bluenotes. These increases were partially
offset by the leveraging of communications, advertising and chargecard fees
primarily at American Eagle. Overall, American Eagle and Bluenotes both
contributed to the deleveraging of selling, general and administrative expenses.
Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses per square foot
declined compared to the same period last year and increased slightly per
average store. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense as a percent to net
sales increased to 37% from 35% due primarily to our American Eagle stores
expansion, including new and remodeled stores. Goodwill Impairment Loss Based on the unanticipated and continued weak performance of
the Bluenotes division during Fiscal 2003, the Company believed that certain
indicators of impairment were present. As a result, the Company performed
an interim test of impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142 during the quarter
ended November 1, 2003. The Company completed step one and determined that
impairment was likely, which also required the completion of step two. Due
to the significant assumptions required for this test, the Company retained an
independent third party to perform a step two analysis and to validate
Management assumptions used in step one. Although the third party
valuation was still pending as of November 1, 2003, Management believed that a
loss was probable and determined its best estimate at that time in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, as supplemented by SFAS No. 5, 
Accounting for Contingencies. As a result, the Company recorded an
$80 million estimated impairment loss during the quarter ended November 1,
2003. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003, the independent third party
valuation of the Bluenotes reporting unit was completed. Based upon the step one
analysis, it was concluded that the fair market value of the Bluenotes reporting
unit was below the book value of the business. The Company completed the step
two analysis and allocated the fair value, as determined by the valuation firm, to the existing assets and liabilities and
13 determined that the remaining carrying value of the goodwill was impaired. As a result, the Company recorded
an additional $61 million loss during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003. See
Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Other Income, Net Other income, net decreased to $20 million from $25 million
due primarily to lower interest income partially offset by lower interest
expense. Net Income Reported net income decreased to $600 million, or 39% as a
percent to net sales. Adjusted net income*, which excludes the non-cash goodwill
impairment charges, decreased to $741 million, or 49% as a percent to net
sales, from $887 million, or 60% as a percent to net sales. The decline in net
income was attributable to the factors noted above.
Diluted income per common share decreased to $083. Adjusted
diluted income per common share*, which excludes the non-cash goodwill
impairment charges, decreased to $103 from $122. The decline in diluted income
per common share was attributable to the factors noted above. A complete definition and discussion of the Company use of
non-GAAP measures, identified by an asterisk *, is located below.
Comparison of Fiscal 2002 to Fiscal 2001 Net Sales Consolidated net sales increased 67% to $1463 billion from
$1372 billion. The sales increase was due to a 131% increase in gross square
feet, consisting primarily of the addition of 74 net new stores offset by a
consolidated comparable store sales decrease of 57%.
American Eagle net sales increased 88% to $1383 billion
from $1271 billion. The sales increase was due to a 145% increase in gross
square feet, consisting primarily of the net addition of 75 stores offset by a
comparable store sales decrease of 43%. The comparable store sales decrease was
driven primarily by a lower average unit retail price due to increased
promotional activity. The units sold per average store and units sold per
transaction increased, while the number of transactions per average store
declined slightly. Comparable store sales in the men business declined in
Fiscal 2002 while the women comparable store sales were flat for the year.
Bluenotes net sales decreased 203% to $802 million from
$1007 million. The sales decline was due primarily to a comparable store sales
decrease of 223%, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
Comparable store sales declined as a result of a lower average unit retail price
as well as a decline in units sold per average store.
A store is included in comparable store sales in the
thirteenth month of operation. However, stores that have a gross square footage
increase of 25% or greater due to an expansion and/or relocation are removed
from the comparable store sales base, but are included in total sales. These
stores are returned to the comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month
following the expansion and/or relocation. Gross Profit Gross profit as a percent to sales declined to 371% from
399%. The percentage decrease was attributed to a lower merchandise margin and
the deleveraging of buying, occupancy and warehousing costs. Both American Eagle
and Bluenotes contributed to the decline in gross margin as a percent to sales. 14 A lower merchandise margin resulted from an increase in
markdowns at both American Eagle and Bluenotes, as a percent to sales, partially
offset by an improved markon at American Eagle. Additionally, the American Eagle
merchandise margin in the second half of the year, primarily the fourth quarter,
was negatively impacted by increased airfreight expense stemming from the West
Coast dock strike. 
Buying, occupancy and warehousing expenses deleveraged due
primarily to the deleveraging of rent expense at both American Eagle and
Bluenotes. 
The Company gross profit may not be comparable to that of
other retailers, as some retailers include all costs related to their
distribution network as well as design costs in cost of sales and others may
exclude a portion of these costs from cost of sales, including them in a line
item such as selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 2 of the
Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company accounting
policy regarding cost of sales, including certain buying, occupancy and
warehousing expenses. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent to
sales decreased to 240% from 247% as a result of reduced incentive
compensation expense as well as cost control measures that were initiated in
Fiscal 2002 at American Eagle. These decreases were partially offset by the
deleveraging of selling, general and administrative expenses at Bluenotes. For
the year, selling, general and administrative expense per gross square foot
declined 85% and decreased 54% per average store. Overall, the Company
leveraged total compensation, advertising, services purchased, leasing costs and
travel expenses in Fiscal 2002 compared to Fiscal 2001. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense as a percent to sales
increased to 35% from 31% due primarily to our American Eagle stores
expansion, including new and remodeled stores.
Other Income, Net Other income, net decreased to $25 million from $28 million
due primarily to higher interest expense. Net Income Net income decreased to $887 million, or 60% as a percent
to net sales, from $1055 million, or 86% as a percent to net sales. The
decline in net income was attributable to the factors noted above.
Diluted income per common share decreased to $122 from $143. The decline in
diluted income per common share was attributable to the factors noted above. Non-GAAP Measure Disclosure
The following definitions are provided for the non-GAAP
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles measures used by the Company in this
Form 10-K. These measures are adjusted net income and adjusted diluted income
per common share. Each use is indicated by an asterisk*. We do not intend for
these non-GAAP measures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the
related GAAP measures. Other companies may define the measures differently. Adjusted Financial Results Adjusted net income* and adjusted diluted income per common
share* exclude the non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $141 million related
to our Bluenotes operation. We believe that these adjusted measures provide
investors with an important perspective on the current underlying operating
performance of our businesses by isolating and excluding the impact of the
non-cash impairment charges related to our acquisition of the Bluenotes business
in Fiscal 2000.
15 The Company defines adjusted net income as GAAP net income
less non-cash goodwill impairment charges. The table below shows a
reconciliation between GAAP net income and adjusted net income*.
The Company defines adjusted diluted income per common
share as GAAP diluted income per common share less non-cash goodwill impairment
charges per share. The table below shows a reconciliation between GAAP diluted
income per common share and adjusted diluted income per common share*. Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
The Company uses of cash are primarily for working capital,
the construction of new stores and the remodeling of existing stores,
information technology upgrades, distribution center improvements and the
purchase of both short and long-term investments. Historically, these uses of
cash have been met through cash flow from operations. 
The following sets forth certain measures of the Company liquidity

Working capital in 000 
$336,588

Current ratio
278 
301 The Company major source of cash from operations is
merchandise sales. Our primary outflows of cash for operations are for the
purchase of inventory, operational costs, and the payment of taxes.
Net cash provided by operating activities of $1895 million
during Fiscal 2003 reflected changes in working capital as well as an increase
in non-cash charges, depreciation and amortization, and the goodwill impairment
loss offset by lower net income compared to the same period last year. The
changes in working capital were primarily due to the timing of income tax
payments and a reduction in cash used for inventory purchases.
Investing activities for Fiscal 2003 included $642 million
for capital expenditures and $638 million for the net purchase of investments.
Capital expenditures consisted primarily of $496 million related to 59 new and
66 remodeled American Eagle stores in the United States and Canada. The
remaining capital expenditures related primarily to fixtures and improvements to
existing stores and technological improvements. The Company purchased both short
and long-term investments during Fiscal 2003. We invest primarily in tax-exempt
municipal bonds, taxable agency bonds and corporate notes with an original
maturity between three and twenty-four months and an expected rate of return of
approximately a 2% taxable equivalent yield. The Company places an emphasis on
investing in tax-exempt and tax-advantaged asset classes. Additionally, all
investments must have a highly liquid secondary market. 
Cash outflows for financing activities of $50 million during
Fiscal 2003 were primarily used for principle payments on the note payable. 
16 The Company has an unsecured demand lending arrangement the
facility with a bank to provide a $1186 million line of credit at either the
lender prime lending rate 40% at January 31, 2004 or a negotiated rate such
as LIBOR. The facility has a limit of $400 million to be used for direct
borrowing. No borrowings were required against the line for the current or prior
periods. At January 31, 2004, letters of credit in the amount of $397 million
were outstanding on this facility, leaving a remaining available balance on the
line of $789 million. The Company also has an uncommitted letter of credit
facility for $500 million with a separate financial institution. At January 31,
2004, letters of credit in the amount of $250 million were outstanding on this
facility, leaving a remaining available balance on the line of $250 million.
The Company has a $291 million non-revolving term facility
the term facility in connection with its Canadian acquisition. The term
facility has an outstanding balance, including foreign currency translation
adjustments, of $187 million as of January 31, 2004. The facility requires
annual payments of $48 million and matures in December 2007. The term facility
bears interest at the one-month Bankers' Acceptance Rate 25% at January 31,
2004 plus 140 basis points. 
On November 30, 2000, the Company entered into an interest
rate swap agreement totaling $292 million in connection with the term facility.
The swap amount decreases on a monthly basis beginning January 1, 2001 until the
termination of the agreement in December 2007. The Company utilizes the interest
rate swap to manage interest rate risk. The Company pays a fixed rate of 597%
and receives a variable rate based on the one-month Bankers' Acceptance Rate.
This agreement effectively changes the interest rate on the borrowings under the
term facility from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 597% plus 140 basis
points.
The Company also had an $112 million revolving operating
facility the operating facility that was used to support the working capital
and capital expenditures of the acquired Canadian businesses. The operating
facility was due in November 2003 and had four additional one-year extensions.
The Company has chosen not to extend the operating facility for another year.
During Fiscal 2002, the Company borrowed and subsequently repaid $48 million
under the operating facility. There were no borrowings under the operating
facility for the years ended January 31, 2004 or February 2, 2002. 
On February 24, 2000, the Company Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase of up to 3,750,000 shares of its stock. As part of
this stock repurchase program, the Company purchased 40,000, 1,140,000 and
63,800 shares of common stock for approximately $06 million, $178 million and
$11 million on the open market during Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001,
respectively. As of January 31, 2004, approximately 700,000 shares remain
authorized for repurchase. Additionally, during Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and
Fiscal 2001, the Company purchased 8,000 shares, 58,000 shares and 44,000
shares, respectively, from certain employees at market prices totaling $01
million, $16 million and $14 million, respectively, for the payment of taxes
in connection with the vesting of restricted stock as permitted under the 1999
Stock Incentive Plan. These repurchases have been recorded as treasury stock.
We have never declared or paid cash dividends and presently
all of our earnings are being retained for the development of our business and
the share repurchase program see Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial
Statements. We assess our dividend policy from time to time. The payment of any
future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be
based on future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, changes in
U.S. taxation and other relevant factors.
We expect capital expenditures for Fiscal 2004 to be
approximately $85 to $90 million, which will relate primarily to approximately
50 new American Eagle stores in the United States and Canada, and the remodeling
of approximately 50 American Eagle stores in the United States. Remaining
capital expenditures will relate to new fixtures and enhancements to existing
stores, an investment relating to our corporate headquarters, information
technology upgrades and distribution center improvements. Additionally, in
Fiscal 2004, we plan to pay $48 million in scheduled principal payments on the
term facility. We plan to fund these capital expenditures and debt repayments
primarily through existing cash and cash generated from operations. These
forward-looking statements will be influenced by our financial position,
consumer spending, availability of financing, and the number of acceptable
leases that may become available. 17 Our growth strategy includes the possibility of acquisitions
and/or internally developing new brands. We periodically consider and evaluate
these options to support future growth. In the event we do pursue such options,
we could require additional equity or debt financing. There can be no assurance
that we would be successful in closing any potential transaction, or that any
endeavor we undertake would increase our profitability.

New Accounting Pronouncements FIN No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
The FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Instruments, in January 2003 and
subsequently issued a revision of the Interpretation in December 2003 FIN
46R. FIN 46R requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated
by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity
do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not
have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without
additional financial support from other parties. The provisions of FIN 46R are
effective for the first reporting period that ends after December 15, 2003 for
variable interests in those entities commonly referred to as special-purpose
entities. Application of the provisions of FIN 46R for all other entities is
effective for the first reporting period ending after March 15, 2004. The
Company has no interest in any entity considered a special purpose entity;
therefore, the initial adoption of FIN 46R did not have a material impact on the
Company. Management is currently performing an evaluation of the effect, if any,
that the adoption of the remaining provisions of FIN 46R may have on the
Company. However, this adoption is not anticipated to have a material impact on
the Company consolidated financial position, results of operations or
liquidity. 18 Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries have various
transactions with related parties. The Company believes that the terms of these
transactions are as favorable to the Company as those that could be obtained
from unrelated third parties. The nature of the Company relationship with
these related parties and a description of the respective transactions are as
follows: 
As of January 31, 2004, the Schottenstein-Deshe-Diamond
families the families owned 26% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of
the Company. The families also own a private company, Schottenstein Stores
Corporation SSC, which owns Linmar Realty Company and also includes a
publicly-traded subsidiary, Retail Ventures, Inc. RVI, formerly Value City
Department Stores, Inc. The Company had the following transactions with these
related parties during Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001.  
The Company leases its distribution center and headquarters offices from
Linmar Realty Company.
The Company sells portions of its end-of-season, overstock and irregular
merchandise to RVI. 
SSC and its affiliates charge the Company for an allocated cost of various
professional services provided to the Company, including certain legal, real
estate, travel and insurance services.
Deposits were previously made with SSC in a cost sharing arrangement for
the acquisition of an interest in several corporate aircraft. The
Company is currently negotiating a discontinuation of this agreement. The
Company incurred operating costs and usage fees under this arrangement. 
In connection with the liquidation of certain inventory from the Canadian
acquisition, the Company contracted the services of a related party
consultant, an affiliate of SSC, during Fiscal 2001. See Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding related party transactions. Income Taxes As of January 31, 2004, we had deferred tax assets of $117
million associated with foreign tax loss carryforwards. We anticipate that
future taxable income in Canada will be sufficient to utilize the full amount of
the deferred tax assets. Assuming a 38% effective tax rate, we will need to
recognize pretax net income of approximately $313 million in future periods to
recover this deferred tax amount.
A valuation allowance was provided against the deferred tax
asset that resulted from a capital loss carryforward in the amount of $15
million. Management believes that it is not likely that the previously
identified tax strategies will enable the Company to utilize the capital loss
carryforward prior to the July 2006 expiration date. The effective tax rate used
for the provision of income tax approximated 44%. The increase in the effective
tax rate during Fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge
of $141 million for which no income tax benefit was recorded. See Note 12 of
the Consolidated Financial Statements. Impact of Inflation/Deflation We do not believe that inflation has had a significant effect
on our net sales or our profitability. Substantial increases in cost, however,
could have a significant impact on our business and the industry in the future.
Additionally, while deflation could positively impact our merchandise costs, it
could have an adverse effect on our average unit retail price, resulting in
lower sales and profitability.
19 Safe Harbor Statement, Seasonality and Risk Factors This report contains various forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which represent
our expectations or beliefs concerning future events, including the following  the planned opening of approximately 50 American Eagle stores in the
United States and Canada in Fiscal 2004,
the selection of approximately 50 stores in the United States for
remodeling, 
the sufficiency of existing cash and investment balances, cash flows and
line of credit facilities to meet Fiscal 2004 cash requirements, and 
the possibility of growth through acquisitions and/or internally
developing new brands. We caution that these statements are further qualified by
factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in
the forward-looking statements, including without limitation, the following: Our ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer
preferences and fashion trends in a timely manner The Company future success depends, in part, upon its
ability to identify and respond to fashion trends in a timely manner. The
specialty retail apparel business fluctuates according to changes in the economy
and customer preferences, dictated by fashion and season. These fluctuations
especially affect the inventory owned by apparel retailers, since merchandise
typically must be ordered well in advance of the selling season. While we
endeavor to test many merchandise items before ordering large quantities, we are
still susceptible to changing fashion trends and fluctuations in customer
demands.
In addition, the cyclical nature of the retail business
requires that we carry a significant amount of inventory, especially during our
peak selling seasons. We enter into agreements for the manufacture and purchase
of our private label apparel well in advance of the applicable selling season.
As a result, we are vulnerable to changes in consumer demand, pricing shifts,
and the timing and selection of merchandise purchases. Changes in fashion
trends, if unsuccessfully identified, forecasted or responded to by the Company,
could, among other things, lead to lower sales, excess inventories and higher
markdowns, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Company
results of operations and financial condition. The effect of competitive pressures from other retailers and
other business factors The specialty retail industry is highly competitive. The
Company competes primarily on the basis of quality, fashion, service, selection
and price. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to
successfully compete in the future.
The success of the Company operations also depends to a
significant extent upon a number of factors relating to discretionary consumer
spending, including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income
such as employment, consumer debt, interest rates, and consumer confidence.
There can be no assurance that consumer spending will not be negatively affected
by general or local economic conditions, thereby adversely impacting the
Company continued growth and results of operations. 
Our ability to expand through new store growth The Company continued growth and success will depend in
part on its ability to open and operate new stores on a timely and profitable
basis. During Fiscal 2004, the Company plans to open approximately 50 new
American Eagle stores in the United States and Canada. Accomplishing the
Company new store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors,
including the ability to obtain suitable sites for new stores at acceptable
costs, the hiring and training of qualified personnel, particularly at the store
management level, the integration of new stores into existing operations, the
expansion of the Company buying and inventory capabilities and the
availability of capital. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able
to achieve its store expansion goals, manage its growth effectively,
successfully integrate the planned new stores into the Company operations or
operate its new stores profitably.
20 Our ability to successfully reposition the Bluenotes brand The Company future earnings depend, in part, upon its
ability to successfully reposition the Bluenotes brand. The Bluenotes business
began incurring operating losses during Fiscal 2002 due to a combination of
factors, including i an abrupt change to the target customer and merchandising
strategy, ii adjusting the merchandise fit to a smaller size, iii a
merchandise product assortment that was skewed too high in price points and not
consistent with the brand strategy, iv a marketing approach that was too
narrow in scope, v a lack of sourcing efficiencies and vi increased
competitive pressure. The Company made management changes in the Bluenotes
division in 2003 and has implemented new merchandising and operating strategies.
However, the Bluenotes business continued to under perform andincurred an
operating loss of approximately $293 million during Fiscal 2003 see Note 11 of
the Consolidated Financial Statements. Furthermore, the Bluenotes business
continues to face challenges, including the installation of a new design team
and increased competitive pressures. If the business trend does not improve and
the Company is not successful repositioning the Bluenotes brand, Management may
need to evaluate potential strategic alternatives for this division during
Fiscal 2004.
Based on the unanticipated and continued weak performance of
the Bluenotes division during Fiscal 2003, the Company believed that certain
indicators of impairment were present. As a result, the Company performed
an interim test of impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142 during the quarter
ended November 1, 2003. The Company completed step one and determined that
impairment was likely, which also required the completion of step two. Due
to the significant assumptions required for this test, the Company retained a
third party to perform an independent step two analysis and to validate
Management assumptions used in step one. Although the third party
valuation was still pending as of November 1, 2003, Management believed that a
loss was probable and determined its best estimate at that time in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, as supplemented by SFAS No. 5, 
Accounting for Contingencies. As a result, the Company recorded an
$80 million estimated impairment loss during the quarter ended November 1,
2003. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003, the independent third party
valuation of the Bluenotes reporting unit was completed. Based upon the step one
analysis, it was concluded that the fair market value of the Bluenotes reporting
unit was below the book value of the business. The Company completed the step
two analysis and allocated the fair value, as determined by the valuation firm,
to the existing assets and liabilities and determined that the remaining
carrying value of the goodwill was impaired. As a result, the Company recorded
an additional $61 million loss during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003. See
Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The interruption of the flow of merchandise from key vendors,
including the effect of the elimination of the quota The Company purchases merchandise from domestic and foreign
suppliers. During Fiscal 2003, a majority of the Company merchandise was
purchased from foreign suppliers. Since we rely on a small number of overseas
sources for a significant portion of our purchases, any event causing the
disruption of imports including the insolvency of a significant supplier or a
significant labor dispute, such as a dock strike could have an adverse effect on
our operations. Other events which could also cause a disruption of imports
include the imposition of additional trade law provisions or import
restrictions, such as increased duties, tariffs, anti-dumping provisions,
increased Custom enforcement actions, or political or economic disruptions.
Additionally, a majority of the merchandise imported by the
Company has been subject to import quotas. These quotas restrict the quantity of
a given textile or apparel product that can be exported on an annual basis from
a given country. As of January 1, 2005, the U.S. has agreed to phase out these
quotas. This phase-out of textile and apparel quotas, and the resulting removal
of country specific restrictions on the quantity of goods that can be imported
into the U.S., could have a significant impact on worldwide sourcing patterns
during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 as well as in 2005. However, the extent
of this impact, if any, and the possible effect on the Company purchasing
patterns and costs, can not be determined at this time.
We do not maintain any long-term or exclusive commitments or
arrangements to purchase from any single supplier. 
21 Seasonality Historically, our operations have been seasonal, with a
significant amount of net sales and net income occurring in the fourth fiscal
quarter, reflecting increased demand during the year-end holiday selling season
and, to a lesser extent, the third quarter, reflecting increased demand during
the back-to-school selling season. During Fiscal 2003, the third and fourth
fiscal quarters accounted for approximately 586% of our sales. As a result of
this seasonality, any factors negatively affecting us during the third and
fourth fiscal quarters of any year, including adverse weather or unfavorable
economic conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations for the entire year. Our quarterly results
of operations also may fluctuate based upon such factors as the timing of
certain holiday seasons, the number and timing of new store openings, the amount
of net sales contributed by new and existing stores, the timing and level of
markdowns, store closings, refurbishments and relocations, competitive factors,
weather and general economic conditions. Other risk factors Additionally, other factors could adversely affect our
financial performance, including factors such as: our ability to successfully
acquire and integrate other businesses; any interruption of our key business
systems; any disaster or casualty resulting in the interruption of service from
our distribution centers or in a large number of our stores; any interruption of
key services provided by third party vendors; changes in weather
patterns; the effects of changes in current exchange rates and interest rates;
and international and domestic acts of terror. The impact of all of the previously discussed factors, some
of which are beyond our control, may cause our actual results to differ
materially from expected results in these statements and other forward-looking
statements we may make from time-to-time.
ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
The Company has market risk exposure related to interest
rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Market risk is measured as the
potential negative impact on earnings, cash flows or fair values resulting from
a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over
the next year. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on cash
equivalents and investments. The impact on cash and investments held at the end
of Fiscal 2003 from a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would be a
decrease in interest income of approximately $04 million during Fiscal 2003. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk We are exposed to the impact of foreign exchange rate risk
primarily through our Canadian operations where the functional currency is the
Canadian dollar. The recent weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to the
Canadian dollar has positively impacted our net sales and any operating income
generated by our Canadian businesses; however it has negatively impacted any
operating losses generated by our Canadian businesses, specifically Bluenotes.
As of January 31, 2004, a 10% change in the Canadian foreign exchange rate would
result in an increase or decrease in our net income of approximately $08
million during Fiscal 2003. We are also subject to foreign exchange transaction
exposure when our Canadian businesses purchase inventory in U.S. dollars. The
Company has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts from time to time to
mitigate this risk. However, the Company does not have any foreign currency
forward contracts outstanding as of January 31, 2004. 22 ITEM 8.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Fiscal Year The Company financial year is a 52/53 week year that ends
on the Saturday nearest to January 31. As used herein, Fiscal 2003, Fiscal
2002 and Fiscal 2001 refer to the fifty-two week periods ended January, 31,
2004, February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002, respectively. Fiscal 2004 refers
to the fifty-two week period ending January 29, 2005. Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates
based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may
result in revised estimates.
28 Recent Financial Accounting Standards Board Pronouncements
FIN No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
The FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Instruments, in January 2003 and
subsequently issued a revision of the Interpretation in December 2003 FIN
46R. FIN 46R requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated
by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity
do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not
have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without
additional financial support from other parties. The provisions of FIN 46R are
effective for the first reporting period that ends after December 15, 2003 for
variable interests in those entities commonly referred to as special-purpose
entities. Application of the provisions of FIN 46R for all other entities is
effective for the first reporting period ending after March 15, 2004. The
Company has no interest in any entity considered a special purpose entity;
therefore, the initial adoption of FIN 46R did not have a material impact on the
Company. Management is currently performing an evaluation of the effect, if any,
that the adoption of the remaining provisions of FIN 46R may have on the
Company. However, this adoption is not anticipated to have a material impact on
the Company consolidated financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.
Foreign Currency Translation
The Canadian dollar is the functional currency for the
Canadian businesses. In accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency
Translation, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were
translated into U.S. dollars the reporting currency at the exchange rate
prevailing at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses denominated in
foreign currencies were translated into U.S. dollars at the monthly average
exchange rate for the period. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency
transactions are included in the results of operations, whereas, related
translation adjustments are reported as an element of other comprehensive
income, net of income taxes, in accordance with SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income see Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash includes cash equivalents. The Company considers all
highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to
be cash equivalents. Short-term Investments
Cash in excess of operating requirements is invested in
taxable or tax-exempt fixed income notes or bonds. As of January 31, 2004,
short-term investments included investments with an original maturity of greater
than three months averaging approximately six months and consisted primarily
of tax-exempt municipal bonds, taxable agency bonds and corporate notes
classified as available for sale. Merchandise Inventory Merchandise inventory is valued at the lower of average cost
or market, utilizing the retail method. Average cost includes merchandise design
and sourcing costs and related expenses. The Company recognizes its inventory at
the point when it arrives at one of our deconsolidation centers. 
The Company reviews its inventory levels in order to identify
slow-moving merchandise and generally uses markdowns to clear merchandise.
Markdowns may occur when inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style,
seasonal adaptation, changes in customer preference, lack of consumer acceptance
of fashion items, competition, or if it is determined that the inventory in
stock will not sell at its currently ticketed price. Such markdowns may have an
adverse impact on earnings, depending on the extent and amount of inventory
affected.
29 Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is recorded on the basis of cost with
depreciation computed utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives as follows  
Buildings 
25 to 40 years 
Leasehold improvements 
5 to 10 years 
Fixtures and equipment 
3 to 5 years 
In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, management evaluates the
ongoing value of leasehold improvements and store fixtures associated with
retail stores which have been open longer than one year. Impairment losses are
recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances
indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows
estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts of
those assets. When events such as these occur, the impaired assets are adjusted
to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded in selling, general
and administrative expenses. The Company recognized $19 million and $06
million in impairment losses during Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002, respectively.
There were no impairment losses recognized during Fiscal 2001. 
Goodwill 
The Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, on February 3, 2002, the beginning of Fiscal 2002. In
accordance with SFAS No. 142, management evaluates goodwill for impairment by
comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the book value. The book value
of goodwill has been assigned to the Company American Eagle and Bluenotes
reporting units. Approximately $103 million and $137 million in goodwill was
assigned to American Eagle and Bluenotes, respectively. The Company made an
adjustment to goodwill for approximately $04 million during Fiscal 2002 related
to the Canadian acquisition lease costs. The fair value of the Company
reporting units is estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies and market
comparable information. Based on the analysis, if the implied fair value of each
reporting unit exceeds the book value of the goodwill, no impairment loss is
recognized. During Fiscal 2003, the Company recognized impairment losses
attributed to its Bluenotes goodwill and reduced the goodwill carrying value to
zero. See Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no
impairment losses relating to goodwill recognized for Fiscal 2002 or Fiscal
2001. 
Long-term Investments
As of January 31, 2004, long-term investments included investments with an
original maturity of greater than twelve months, but not exceeding twenty-four
months averaging approximately twenty-one months and consisted primarily of
agency bonds and debt securities issued by states and local municipalities
classified as available-for-sale. Other Assets Other assets consist primarily of deferred taxes, lease
buyout costs, trademark costs and acquisition costs. The lease buyout costs are
amortized over the remaining life of the leases, generally for no greater than
ten years. The trademark costs are amortized over five to fifteen years.
Acquisition costs are amortized over five years. These assets, net of
amortization, are presented as other assets long-term on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Interest Rate Swap The Company interest rate swap agreement is used to manage
interest rate risk. The derivative effectively changes the interest rate on the
borrowings under the non-revolving term facility from a variable rate to a fixed
rate. The Company recognizes its derivative on the balance sheet at fair value
at the end of each period. Changes in the fair value of the derivative that is
designated and meets all the required criteria for a cash flow hedge are
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss. During Fiscal 2003,
unrealized net losses on derivative
instruments of approximately $01 million, net of related tax effects, were
recorded in other comprehensive income loss. The Company does not hold or
issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
30 Stock Repurchases On February 24, 2000, the Company Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase of up to 3,750,000 shares of its stock. As part of
this stock repurchase program, the Company purchased 40,000, 1,140,000 and
63,800 shares of common stock for approximately $06 million, $178 million and
$11 million on the open market during Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001,
respectively. As of January 31, 2004, approximately 700,000 shares remain
authorized for repurchase. Additionally, during Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and
Fiscal 2001, the Company purchased 8,000 shares, 58,000 shares and 44,000
shares, respectively, from certain employees at market prices totaling $01
million, $16 million and $14 million, respectively, for the payment of taxes
in connection with the vesting of restricted stock as permitted under the 1999
Stock Incentive Plan. These repurchases have been recorded as treasury stock.
Income Taxes
The Company calculates income taxes in accordance with SFAS
No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires the use of the asset
and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in
effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse. A
valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets when it is
more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes may not be
realized. Stock Option Plan The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans
under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees. The pro forma information below is based on provisions of SFAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No.
148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure
SFAS No. 148, issued in December 2002. SFAS No. 148 requires that the pro
forma information regarding net income and earnings per share be determined as
if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options granted beginning in
the fiscal year subsequent to December 31, 1994 under the fair value method of
that Statement. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of
grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions:
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for
use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models
require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock
price volatility. Because the Company employee stock options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and
because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the
fair value estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee
stock options.

Revenue Recognition The Company records revenue for store sales upon the purchase
of merchandise by customers. The Company
e-commerce and catalog business records revenue at the time the goods are
shipped. Revenue is not recorded on the purchase of gift cards. A current
liability is recorded upon purchase and revenue is recognized when the gift card
is redeemed for merchandise. Revenue is recorded net of sales returns. 
Revenue is not recorded on the sell-off of end-of-season,
overstock and irregular merchandise to off-price retailers. These sell-offs are
typically sold below cost and the proceeds are reflected in cost of sales. See
Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Cost of Sales, Including Certain Buying, Occupancy and
Warehousing Expenses Cost of sales consists of merchandise costs, including
design, sourcing, importing and inbound freight costs, as well as markdowns,
shrinkage and promotional costs. Buying, occupancy and warehousing costs
consists of compensation and travel for our buyers; rent and utilities related
to our stores, corporate headquarters, distribution centers and other office
space; freight from our distribution centers to the stores; and compensation and
supplies for our distribution centers, including purchasing, receiving and
inspection costs.
The gross profit impact of a sales returns reserve, which is
recorded in cost of sales, is provided on gross sales for projected merchandise
returns based on historical average return percentages. During Fiscal 2003, the
Company obtained better information regarding the historical rate components
which resulted in a reduction of the estimated return percentage. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of
compensation and employee benefit expenses, other than for our design, sourcing
and importing teams, our buyers and our distribution centers. Such compensation
and employee benefit expenses include salaries, incentives and related benefits
associated with our stores and corporate headquarters, except as previously
noted. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include advertising
costs, supplies for our stores and home office, freight related to inter-store
transfers, communication costs, travel and entertainment, leasing costs and
services purchased.
32 Advertising Costs 
Certain advertising costs, including direct mail, in-store
photographs and other promotional costs are expensed when the marketing campaign
commences. Costs associated with the production of television advertising are
expensed over the life of the campaign. All other advertising costs are expensed
as incurred. The Company recognized $465 million in advertising expense during
both Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 and $453 million during Fiscal 2001. Design Costs The Company has certain design costs, which include
compensation, rent, travel, supplies and samples, which are included in cost of
sales as the respective inventory is sold. Legal Proceedings and Claims The Company is subject to certain legal proceedings and
claims arising out of the conduct of its business. In accordance with SFAS No.
5, Accounting for Contingencies, Management records a reserve for
estimated losses when the amount is probable and can be reasonably estimated. If
a range of possible loss exists, the Company records the accrual at the low end
of the range, in accordance with FIN 14, an interpretation of SFAS No. 5. As the
Company has provided adequate reserves, it believes that the ultimate outcome of
any matter currently pending against the Company will not materially affect the
financial position of the Company. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information

33 Reclassification Certain reclassifications have been made to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for prior periods in order to conform to the Fiscal 2003
presentation. 3. Related Party Transactions The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries have various
transactions with related parties. The Company believes that the terms of these
transactions are as favorable to the Company as those that could be obtained
from unrelated third parties. The nature of the Company relationship with
these related parties and a description of the respective transactions are as
follows: 
As of January 31, 2004, the Schottenstein-Deshe-Diamond
families the families owned 26% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of
the Company. The families also own a private company, Schottenstein Stores
Corporation SSC, which owns Linmar Realty Company and also includes a
publicly-traded subsidiary, Retail Ventures, Inc. RVI, formerly Value City
Department Stores, Inc. The Company had the following transactions with these
related parties during Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001.
The Company has an operating lease for its corporate
headquarters and distribution center with Linmar Realty Company. The lease,
which expires on December 31, 2020, provides for annual rental payments of
approximately $24 million through 2005, $26 million through 2015, and $27
million through the end of the lease. Rent expense was $24 million during
Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 and $25 million during Fiscal 2001 under the lease. The Company and its subsidiaries sell end-of-season,
overstock and irregular merchandise to various parties, including RVI. These
sell-offs, which are without recourse, are typically sold below cost and the
proceeds are reflected in cost of sales. The cost of merchandise disposed of via
sell-offs during Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001 was $383 million 213 million and $119 million, respectively, which resulted in adjustments to
cost of sales of $60 million, $19 million and $17 million for the respective
years attributed to these transactions. Included in these amounts were $129
million, $78 million and $46 million of merchandise, at cost, which was sold
to RVI during Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, respectively, and
resulted in adjustments to cost of sales of $03 million, $01 million and $11 million
during the respective periods. 
The Company had approximately $28 million and $13 million
included in accounts receivable at January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003,
respectively, that pertained to related party merchandise sell-offs.
SSC and its affiliates charge the Company for various
professional services provided to the Company, including certain legal, real
estate, travel and insurance services. For Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal
2001, the Company paid approximately $09 million, $05 million and $14
million, respectively, for these services. 
Deposits were previously made with SSC totaling approximately
$25 million in a cost sharing arrangement for the acquisition of an interest in
several corporate aircraft. These deposits were included in other assets,
net of accumulated amortization as of February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002. The
Company is currently negotiating a discontinuation of this arrangement and has
determined the net realizable value of these deposits based upon an independent
third party valuation. As a result, the Company expects to receive approximately
$14 million from SSC, which was included in related party accounts receivable
as of January 31, 2004 see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company has recognized a loss of $10 million as a result of this
write-down, which was included in selling, general and administrative expenses
during Fiscal 2003. Additionally, the Company paid $10 million during Fiscal
2003 and Fiscal 2002 and $11 million during Fiscal 2001 to cover its share of
operating costs based on usage of the corporate aircraft under the cost sharing
arrangement.
In connection with the liquidation of certain inventory from
the Canadian acquisition in October 2000, the Company contracted the services of
a related party consultant, an affiliate of SSC. The contract was in effect
until July 2001, when certain stores closed and were turned over to the Company
for conversion to American Eagle stores. During Fiscal 2001, the Company paid
$17 million to the consultant. As of February 2, 2002, all services were
completed under this contract. As a result, there were no payments made during
Fiscal 2002 or Fiscal 2003.

35 6. Note Payable and Other Credit Arrangements Unsecured Demand Lending Arrangement The Company has an unsecured demand lending arrangement the
facility with a bank to provide a $1186 million line of credit at either the
lender prime lending rate 40% at January 31, 2004 or a negotiated rate such
as LIBOR. The facility has a limit of $400 million to be used for direct
borrowing. Because there were no borrowings during any of the past three years,
there were no amounts paid for interest on this facility. At January 31, 2004,
letters of credit in the amount of $397 million were outstanding on this
facility, leaving a remaining available balance on the line of $789 million. Uncommitted Letter of Credit Facility The Company also has an uncommitted letter of credit facility
for $500 million with a separate financial institution. At January 31, 2004,
letters of credit in the amount of $250 million were outstanding on this
facility, leaving a remaining available balance on the line of $250 million. Non-revolving Term Facility and Revolving Operating Facility The Company has a $291 million non-revolving term facility
the term facility in connection with its Canadian acquisition. The term
facility has an outstanding balance, including foreign currency translation
adjustments, of $187 million as of January 31, 2004. The facility requires
annual payments of $48 million and matures in December 2007. The term facility
bears interest at the one-month Bankers' Acceptance Rate 25% at January 31,
2004 plus 140 basis points. Interest paid under the term facility was $15
million, $16 million and $18 million for the years ended January 31, 2004,
February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002, respectively.
The term facility contains restrictive covenants related to
financial ratios. As of January 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with
these covenants. 
The Company also had an $112 million revolving operating
facility the operating facility that was used to support the working capital
and capital expenditures of the acquired Canadian businesses. The operating
facility was due in November 2003 and had four additional one-year extensions.
The Company has chosen not to extend the operating facility. During Fiscal 2002,
the Company borrowed and subsequently repaid $48 million under the operating
facility. Interest paid under the operating facility was $01 million for the
year ended February 1, 2003. There were no borrowings under the operating
facility for the years ended January 31, 2004 or February 2, 2002. 
7. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities On November 30, 2000, the Company entered into an interest
rate swap agreement totaling $292 million in connection with the term facility.
The swap amount decreases on a monthly basis beginning January 1, 2001 until the
termination of the agreement in December 2007. The Company utilizes the interest
rate swap to manage interest rate risk. The Company pays a fixed rate of 597%
and receives a variable rate based on the one-month Bankers' Acceptance Rate.
This agreement effectively changes the interest rate on the borrowings under the
term facility from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 597% plus 140 basis
points.
In accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, the Company recognizes its derivative on
the balance sheet at fair value at the end of each period. Changes in the fair
value of the derivative that is designated and meets all the required criteria
for a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income
loss. Unrealized net gains losses on derivative instruments of approximately
$01 million, $03 million, and $07 million for the years ended January 31,
2004, February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002, respectively, net of related tax
effects, were recorded in other comprehensive income loss. The Company does not believe there is any significant
exposure to credit risk due to the creditworthiness of the bank. In the event of
non-performance by the bank, the Company loss would be limited to any
unfavorable interest rate differential.

9. Goodwill In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets, effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2001. Under the new standard, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have
indefinite lives are longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment
tests. Other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their estimated
useful lives.
In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company did not restate
the fiscal year ended February 2, 2002 to add back the amortization expense of
goodwill. If the Company had been accounting for its goodwill under SFAS No. 142
for all prior periods presented, the Company net income and income per common
share would have been as follows for the years ended January 31, 2004, February

37 In accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 142, the
Company assigned and tested its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit
level as of February 3, 2002, the beginning of Fiscal 2002. The Company
identified its reporting units, American Eagle and Bluenotes, as operating
segments in accordance with SFAS No. 142. The Company considers each American
Eagle and Bluenotes retail store location a separate component of the respective
brand or operating segment. The Company determined that each store had similar
characteristics with others in the same brand. As such, the Company aggregated
the stores with the respective brand operating segment and identified the
reporting units at the operating segment level. The Company assigned
approximately $103 million and $137 million in goodwill to the American Eagle
and Bluenotes reporting units, respectively, as of February 3, 2002. 
The fair value of the Company goodwill was estimated using
discounted cash flow methodologies. As a result of the impairment test performed
at February 3, 2002 as well as during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2002, the
Company determined that no goodwill impairment existed. During the fourth
quarter of Fiscal 2002, the Company included consideration of recent management
changes as well as new merchandising and operating strategies in its model
assumptions related to the Bluenotes' goodwill. Based upon these changes, the
Company expected to see an improvement in the Bluenotes operations beginning
with the back-to-school selling season in the third fiscal quarter of 2003. 
During the six months ended August 1, 2003, the Company
continued to monitor the Bluenotes' goodwill for impairment and determined that
no impairment existed during that time based upon the updated discounted cash
flow models. The Company updated its assumptions regarding comparable sales
growth, gross margin percentages, and other operating metrics during this time
and continued to anticipate that a recovery in the Bluenotes business would
occur during the back-to-school selling season. 
During the three months ended November 1, 2003, Bluenotes'
results of operations were below Management expectations. Based on the
implementation of the new merchandising and operating strategies as well as the
management changes within the division, Management was expecting improved
financial results beginning in the third quarter of Fiscal 2003. However,
the segment did not perform to Management expectations and the assumptions for
the discounted cash flow model were amended to reflect a weaker current and
expected financial performance. 
Based on the unanticipated and continued weak performance of
the Bluenotes division during the three months ended November 1, 2003, the
Company believed that certain indicators of impairment were present. As a
result, the Company performed an interim test of impairment in accordance with
SFAS No. 142. The Company completed step one and determined that
impairment was likely, which also required the completion of step two. Due
to the significant assumptions required for this test, the Company retained an
independent third party to perform a step two analysis and to validate
Management assumptions used in step one. Although the third party
valuation was still pending as of November 1, 2003, Management believed that a
loss was probable and determined its best estimate at that time in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, as supplemented by SFAS No. 5, 
Accounting for Contingencies. As a result, the Company recorded an
$80 million estimated impairment loss during the three months ended November 1,
2003. 
During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003, the independent
third party valuation of the Bluenotes reporting unit was completed. Based upon
the step one analysis, it was concluded that the fair market value of the
Bluenotes reporting unit was below the book value of the business. The Company
completed the step two analysis and allocated the fair value, as determined by
the valuation firm, to the existing assets and liabilities and determined that
the remaining carrying value of the goodwill was impaired. As a result, the
Company recorded an additional $61 million loss during the fourth quarter of
Fiscal 2003. As of January 31, 2004, the book value related to the Bluenotes
goodwill was zero.

Fiscal 2003, as noted in the table above, differs from the $141 million
impairment loss attributed to the Bluenotes goodwill, which was recognized in
the Company Consolidated Statements of Operations, due to foreign currency
translation. In accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation,
goodwill denominated in foreign currencies was translated into U.S. dollars at
the exchange rate prevailing at the related acquisition date. Expenses
denominated in foreign currencies were translated into U.S. dollars at the
monthly average exchange rate for the period. 10. Leases The Company leases all store premises, some of our office and
distribution facility space, and certain information technology and office
equipment. The store leases generally have initial terms of ten years. Most of
these store leases provide for base rentals and the payment of a percentage of
sales as additional rent when sales exceed specified levels. Minimum rentals
relating to these leases are recorded on a straight-line basis. These leases are
classified as operating leases. A summary of fixed minimum and contingent rent expense for
all operating leases follows

41 A tax benefit has been recognized as contributed capital, in
the amount of $07 million for the year ended January 31, 2004, $12 million for
the year ended February 1, 2003 and $113 million for the year ended February 2,
2002 resulting from additional tax deductions related to vested restricted stock
grants and stock option exercises.
No provision was made for U.S. Income taxes on any
undistributed earnings of the foreign subsidiaries, as it would be our intention
to utilize those earnings in the foreign operations for an indefinite period of
time.
Of the $120 million deferred tax operating loss
carryforwards, $117 million is associated with foreign tax loss carryforwards,
of which $07 million expires over the next four tax years, $90 million expires
over the next six tax years and $20 million expires over the next seven tax
years. We anticipate that future taxable income in Canada will be sufficient to
utilize the full amount of the deferred tax assets. Assuming a 38% effective tax
rate, we will need to recognize pretax net income of approximately $313 million
in future periods to recover this deferred tax amount. For the year ended
January 31, 2004 the Company recorded a valuation allowance against the capital
loss deferred tax asset of $15 million. The capital loss carryforward will
expire in July 2006.

13. Retirement Plan and Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company maintains a 401k retirement plan and profit
sharing plan. Full-time employees and part-time employees are automatically
enrolled to contribute 3% of their salary if they have attained twenty one years
of age, have completed sixty days of service, and work at least twenty hours per
week. Individuals can decline enrollment or can contribute up to 30% of their
salary to the 401k plan on a pretax basis, subject to IRS limitations. After
one year of service, the Company will match up to 45% of participants' eligible
compensation. Contributions to the profit sharing plan, as determined by the
Board of Directors, are discretionary. The Company recognized $21 million, $31
million, and $09 million in expense during Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal
2001, respectively, in connection with the 401k retirement plan and profit
sharing plan.
The Employee Stock Purchase Plan is a non-qualified plan that
covers employees who are at least 18 years old, have completed sixty days of
service, and work at least twenty hours a week. Contributions are determined by
the employee, with a maximum of $60 per pay period, with the Company matching
15% of the investment. These contributions are used to purchase shares of
Company stock in the open market. 14. Stock Incentive Plan, Stock Option Plan, and Restricted
Stock Grants Stock Incentive Plan The 1999 Stock Incentive Plan the Plan was approved by
the shareholders on June 8, 1999. The Plan authorized 6,000,000 shares for
issuance in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock awards, performance units, or performance shares. The Plan was
subsequently amended, in June 2001, to increase the shares available for grant
to 11,000,000. Additionally, the Plan provides that the maximum number of shares
awarded to any individual may not exceed 3,000,000 shares. The Plan allows the
Compensation and Stock Option Committee to determine which employees and
consultants will receive awards and the terms and conditions of these awards.
The Plan provides for a grant of 1,875 stock options quarterly to each director
who is not an officer or employee of the Company starting in August 2003. At
January 31, 2004, 9,922,770 non-qualified stock options and 453,288 shares of
restricted stock were granted under the Plan to employees and certain
non-employees. 
42 Approximately 37% of the options granted vest eight years after
the date of grant but can be accelerated to vest over three years if the Company
meets annual performance goals. Approximately 31% of the options granted under
the Plan vest over three years, 22% vest over five years with the remaining
grants vesting over one year. All options expire after ten years. Restricted
stock is earned if the Company meets established performance goals. For Fiscal
2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, the Company recorded approximately $13
million, $14 million and $31 million, respectively, in compensation expense
related to stock options and restricted stock in connection with the Plan. Stock Option Plan On February 10, 1994, the Company Board of Directors
adopted the American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. 1994 Stock Option Plan the Plan.
The Plan provided for the grant of 4,050,000 incentive or non-qualified options
to purchase common stock. The Plan was subsequently amended to increase the
shares available for grant to 8,100,000 shares. Additionally, the amendment
provided that the maximum number of options which may be granted to any
individual may not exceed 2,700,000 shares. The options granted under the Plan
are approved by the Compensation and Stock Option Committee of the Board of
Directors, primarily vest over five years, and expire ten years from the date of
grant. The Plan terminated on January 2, 2004 with all rights of the optionees
and all unexpired options continuing in force and operation after the
termination.

Financial Reporting The integrity and objectivity of the financial statements and related financial
information in this report are the responsibility of the management of the
Company. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and
include, when necessary, the best estimates and judgments of management. We maintain a system of internal accounting controls designed to
provide reasonable assurance, at appropriate cost, that assets are safeguarded,
transactions are executed in accordance with our authorization, and the
accounting records provide a reliable basis for the preparation of the financial
statements. The system of internal accounting controls is continually reviewed
by management and improved and modified as necessary in response to changing
business conditions and recommendations of the Company independent auditors. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting of
independent directors, meets periodically with management and independent
auditors to review matters relating to our financial reporting, the adequacy of
internal accounting controls and the scope and results of audit work. Ernst Young LLP, Certified Public Accountants, are engaged to
audit our consolidated financial statements. Their Independent Auditors'
Report, which is based on an audit made in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the
United States, expresses an opinion as to the fair presentation of these
financial statements.
Report of Independent Auditors To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Eagle
Outfitters, Inc. as of January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended
January 31, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. at January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003 and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three fiscal years in the period ended January 31, 2004, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective
