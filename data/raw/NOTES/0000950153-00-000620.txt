Item8.Consolidated Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data
28 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of CSK Auto Corporation In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the index appearing under Item14a1 on page58
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of CSK Auto Corporation and its subsidiary at January30,
2000 and January31, 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended January30, 2000 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements. We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America, which require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

33 CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CSK Auto Corporation is a holding company. At January30,
2000, CSK Auto Corporation had no business activity other than
its investment in CSK Auto, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary
Auto. On a consolidated basis, CSK Auto Corporation
and subsidiary are referred to herein as the
Company. CSK Auto, Inc. is a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket
parts and accessories. At January30, 2000, the Company
operated 1,120 stores in 18 Western and Northern Plains states as
a fully integrated company under three brand names: Checker Auto
Parts, founded in 1969 and operating in the Southwestern, Rocky
Mountain and Northern Plains states; Schucks Auto Supply,
founded in 1917 and operating in the Pacific Northwest; and
Kragen Auto Parts, founded in 1947 and operating primarily in
California.
Note1 Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CSK
Auto Corporation and Auto for all years presented. In addition,
the accounts of Automotive Information Systems, Inc.
AIS are included in the accompanying financial
statements from September7, 1999, the date of acquisition
see Note3. All intercompany accounts and transactions are
eliminated in consolidation.
Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year end is on the Sunday nearest to
January31 of the following calendar year. The fiscal years
ended January30, 2000 fiscal1999,
January31, 1999 fiscal1998 and
February1, 1998 fiscal1997 each
consisted of 52weeks.
Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes sales upon the delivery of products to its
customers, which generally occurs at the Companys retail
store locations. For commercial customers, the Company also
delivers products to customer locations. All retail and
commercial sales are final upon delivery of products. However, as
a convenience to the customer and as typical of most retailers,
the Company will accept merchandise returns. The Company
generally limits the period of time within which products may be
returned to 30days and requires returns to be accompanied
by original packaging and a sales receipt. The accompanying
financial statements include an allowance for sales returns,
which has been estimated by management based upon historical
activity.
Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist primarily of certificates of deposit
with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
Receivables Receivables are primarily comprised of amounts due from vendors
for rebates or allowances and from commercial sales customers.
Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash
equivalents and trade receivables. As of January30, 2000,
the Company had cash and cash equivalents on deposit with a major
financial institution that were in excess of FDIC insured
limits. Historically, the Company has not experienced any loss of
its cash and cash equivalents due to such concentration of
credit risk.
34 CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued The Company does not hold collateral to secure payment of its
trade accounts receivable. However, management performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and
provides an allowance for estimated potential losses. Exposure
to credit loss is limited to the carrying amount.
Inventories and Cost of Sales Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, cost being
determined utilizing the last-in, first-out method. Cost of
sales includes product cost, net of earned vendor rebates,
discounts and allowances. The Company recognizes vendor rebates,
discounts and allowances based on the terms of the underlying
agreements. Such amounts may be amortized over the life of the
applicable agreements or recognized as inventory is sold. Certain
operating and administrative costs associated with purchasing
and handling of inventory are capitalized in inventories. The
amounts of such costs included in inventories as of
January30, 2000 and January31, 1999 were
approximately $318 million and $179 million, respectively. In
addition, the Company increases cost of sales and reduces
inventory by an estimate of purchase discounts and volume rebates
that are unearned at period end, based upon inventory turnover
rates. Such capitalized purchase discounts totaled $235 million
and $132 million as of January30, 2000 and
January31, 1999, respectively. The replacement cost of
inventories approximated $5483 million and $3567 million at
January30, 2000 and January31, 1999, respectively.
Property and Equipment Property, equipment and purchased software are recorded at cost.
Depreciation and amortization are computed for financial
reporting purposes utilizing primarily the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which
range from 5 to 25years, or for leasehold improvements and
property under capital lease, the base lease term or estimated
useful life, if shorter. Maintenance and repairs are charged to
earnings when incurred.
Store Preopening Costs During the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company adopted
Statement of Position SOP 98-5, Reporting on
the Cost of Start-up Activities. SOP98-5 requires
that store preopening costs, consisting primarily of incremental
labor, supplies and occupancy costs directly related to the
opening of specific stores, be expensed as incurred. Previously,
the Company capitalized such costs as prepaid expenses and other
current assets and expensed them during the month in which the
store was opened. See Note2.
Internal Software Development Costs During the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company adopted SOP
98-1 Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed
or Obtained for Internal Use. SOP98-1 provides for
the capitalization of certain internal software development costs
and amortization over the life of the related software.
Previously, internal software development costs, consisting
primarily of incremental internal labor costs and benefits, were
expensed as incurred. Amounts capitalized during 1999 were $17
million with accumulated amortization of $02 million as of
January30, 2000. Total amounts charged to operations for
fiscal years 1998 and 1997 were approximately $16 million and
$13 million, respectively.
Leasehold Interests Leasehold interests represent the discounted net present value of
the excess of the fair rental value over the respective
contractual rent of facilities under operating leases acquired in
business combinations. Amortization expense is computed on a
straight-line basis over the respective lease terms. Accumulated
amortization totaled $166 million and $162 million at
January30, 2000 and January31, 1999, respectively.
35 CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued
Goodwill The cost in excess of net assets acquired is amortized on a
straight-line basis over periods ranging from 20 to
30years, depending on the business acquired. Management
estimates such periods using factors such as entry barriers in
certain regions, operating rights and estimated lives of other
operating assets acquired. The realizability of goodwill and
other intangibles is evaluated periodically when events or
circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover the
carrying amount. Such evaluation is based on cash flow and
profitability projections that incorporate the impact of existing
Company businesses. The analyses necessarily involve significant
management judgment to evaluate the capacity of an acquired
business to perform within projections. Accumulated amortization
as of January30, 2000 was $19 million.
Store Closing Costs The Company provides an allowance for estimated costs and losses
to be incurred in connection with store closures and losses on
the disposal of store-related assets, which is net of anticipated
sublease income. Such costs are recognized when a store is
specifically identified, costs can be estimated and closure is
planned to be completed within the next twelve months. See
Note12.
Advertising The Company expenses all advertising costs as such costs are
incurred. Amounts due under vendor cooperative advertising
agreements are recorded as receivables until their collection.
Advertising expense for fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997 totaled
approximately $165 million, $219 million and $237 million, net
of vendor funded cooperative advertising, respectively.
Assets Held for Sale Assets held for sale consist of newly acquired land, buildings
and store fixtures owned by the Company which the Company intends
in the next twelve months to sell to and lease back from third
parties under lease arrangements.
Long-lived Assets The Company applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed Of, which requires that long-lived assets and
certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used or
disposed of by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In the event assets
are impaired, losses are recognized based on the excess carrying
amount over the estimated fair value of the asset. SFAS
No121 also requires that assets to be disposed of be
reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair market
value less selling costs. The Company evaluates the carrying
value of long-lived assets on a quarterly basis to determine
whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and an
impairment loss should be recognized. Such evaluation is based on
the expected utilization of the related asset and the
corresponding useful life.
Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in
future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their financial reporting amounts
temporary differences at each year end based on
enacted tax laws and statutory rates applicable to the period in
which the temporary differences are expected to affect taxable
income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
Income tax expense includes both taxes payable for the period
and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and
liabilities.
36 CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, encourages but does not require companies to
record compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation
plans at fair value. The Company has chosen to continue to
account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value
method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
and related interpretations thereof. Accordingly, compensation
cost for stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the
market price of the Companys stock at the date of grant
over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. See
Note9.
Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average
outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is based on
the weighted average outstanding shares adjusted for the effect
of stock options. Calculation of shares used in computing per share amounts is
summarized as follows Fiscal Year Ended January30 January31 February1 2000 1999 1998 Common stock outstanding Beginning of period 27,768,832 19,113,388 17,105,000 End of period 27,834,574 27,768,832 19,113,388 Issued during period 65,742 8,655,444 2,008,388 Weighted average number of shares basic 27,815,160 26,722,322 17,400,214 Effects of dilutive securities 811,616 917,777 611,452 Weighted average number of shares diluted 28,626,776 27,640,099 18,011,666 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Reclassifications Certain prior year financial statement amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Note2 Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Cumulative Effect of
Change in Accounting Principle In April1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued
SOP98-5, Reporting on the Cost of Start-up
Activities. The SOP broadly defines start-up activities as
those one-time activities related to opening a new facility,
introducing a new product or service, conducting business in a
new territory, or commencing some new operation. The SOP requires
that the costs of start-up activities be expensed as incurred
and is effective for financial statements for fiscal years
beginning after December15, 1998, with earlier application
encouraged. The Companys historical accounting policy with
respect to the cost of start-up activities store preopening
expenses was to defer such
37 CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued costs for the approximately three month period of time that it
takes to develop a new store facility and to expense such costs
during the month that the new store opens. The Company adopted
SOP98-5 in the first quarter of fiscal 1999, which required
the Company to change its accounting policy to expense start-up
costs as incurred. Upon adoption, the Company expensed
approximately $741,000, net of an income tax benefit of $468,000,
of preopening expenses that had been deferred as of
January31, 1999. Such expense is reflected in the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations as the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. In June1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued SFAS No133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This
Statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments and for hedging activities. It requires
companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities in their statement of financial position and measure
those instruments at fair value. In September1999, the FASB
issued SFAS No137, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities-Deferral of the Effective Date
of FASB Statement No133, which delayed the
effective date of SFAS No133 to fiscal years beginning
after June15, 2000. The Company is analyzing the
implementation requirements and currently does not anticipate
there will be a material impact on its financial position or the
results of its operations.
Note3 Business Acquisitions
Als and Grand Auto Supply On October1, 1999, the Company acquired the common stock of
Als and Grand Auto Supply, Inc. AGA,
formerly known as PACCAR Automotive, Inc., which operated 194
stores under the trade names of Als Auto Supply and Grand
Auto Supply collectively, the AGA stores in
Washington, California, Idaho, Oregon, Nevada and Alaska. The
Company has substantially converted these stores to the
Schucks and Kragen names and store formats and integrated
these stores into the Companys operations. The Company paid approximately $1456 million in cash for the
stock of AGA and associated transaction costs. The acquisition
was funded with proceeds from the Senior Credit Facility. In
connection with the acquisition, the Company amended and restated
the Senior Credit Facility to provide an additional $1500
million of senior term loan borrowing ability. There are no
contingent payments, options or commitments associated with the
acquisition. In connection with the integration of the AGA stores, the Company
will incur one-time transition and integration expenses
estimated to be $288 million, consisting primarily of grand
opening advertising, training and re-merchandising costs.
Approximately $213 million of such expenses were incurred during
fiscal1999 with the balance expected to be incurred during
the first quarter of fiscal2000. In addition, the Company
will incur one-time capital expenditures of approximately $56
million, consisting primarily of expenditures related to
equipment, store fixtures, signage and the installation of the
Companys store-level information systems in the AGA stores.
Approximately $20 million of such capital expenditures were
incurred during fiscal1999 with the balance expected to be
incurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2000. As a result of the AGA acquisition, the Company has analyzed its
store locations in California and the Pacific Northwest. The
Company will close or relocate approximately 39 of the formerly
owned AGA stores of which 37 were closed as of January30,
2000 based on several factors including: 1market
saturation; 2store profitability; and 3store size
and format. Costs associated with these closures consist of
future rents to be paid over the remaining terms of the master
lease agreements for the stores net of estimated sublease
recoveries. In addition, we finalized a store closure plan for
our own stores that overlap with AGA stores, which resulted in a
pretax charge of approximately $25 million during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1999. The charge consisted of two components:
1future rents to be paid over the remaining lease terms
of the master lease agreements for the stores net of estimated
sublease rentals; and 2a write-down in the
38 CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued carrying amounts of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets
associated with the affected stores. See Note12. The AGA acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of these
stores are included in the consolidated operating results of the
Company from October1, 1999, the first day of operations
subsequent to the acquisition. The financial statements reflect
the preliminary allocation of the purchase price, based on
estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, pending final
determination of certain acquired balances. Approximately $1241
million was allocated to inventory, leasehold improvements, fixed
assets and favorable lease rights. The preliminary allocation
also includes an estimated liability for the cost of closing the
39 acquired stores described above. The excess of the purchase
price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired
resulted in goodwill of approximately $607 million and is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over 30years.
Automotive Information Systems On September7, 1999, the Company acquired all of the common
stock of Automotive Information Systems, Inc. AIS.
AIS, based in St. Paul Minnesota, is a leading provider of
diagnostic vehicle repair information to automotive technicians,
automotive replacement parts manufacturers, automotive test
equipment manufacturers, and the do-it-yourself consumer. The
Company paid approximately $103 million in cash for AIS and
funded the acquisition through its Senior Credit Facility. There
are no contingent payments, options or commitments associated
with the acquisition. The AIS acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations are
included in the consolidated operating results of the Company
from September7, 1999, the first day of operations
subsequent to the acquisition. The financial statements reflect
the preliminary allocation of the purchase price, based on
estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, pending final
determination of certain acquired balances. The excess of the
purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets
acquired resulted in goodwill of approximately $92 million and
is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 20years.
Big Wheel On June30, 1999, the Company acquired substantially all of
the assets of Apsco Products Company dba Big Wheel/ Rossi
Big Wheel, the leading retailer of auto parts in
the Northern Plains states. Big Wheel operated 86 stores in
Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin along with a distribution
center in Minnesota. The Company has substantially converted
these stores to the Checker name and store format and integrated
these stores into the Companys operations. The Company paid approximately $627 million in cash for
substantially all the assets and assumed certain current
liabilities and indebtedness of Big Wheel. The acquisition was
funded with proceeds from the Senior Credit Facility. In
connection with the acquisition, the Company amended and restated
the Senior Credit Facility to provide an additional $1250
million of senior term loan borrowing ability. There are no
contingent payments, options or commitments associated with the
acquisition. In connection with the integration of the Big Wheel stores, the
Company will incur one-time transition and integration expenses
estimated to be $125 million, consisting primarily of grand
opening advertising, training and re-merchandising costs.
Approximately $89 million of such expenses were incurred during
fiscal 1999 with the balance expected to be incurred during the
first quarter of fiscal 2000. In addition, the Company will incur
one-time capital expenditures estimated to be $32 million,
consisting primarily of expenditures related to equipment, store
fixtures, signage and the installation of the Companys
store-level information systems in the Big Wheel stores.
Approximately $30 million of such capital expenditures were
incurred during fiscal1999 with the balance expected to be
incurred during the first quarter of fiscal2000.

Continued The Big Wheel acquisition was accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of
these stores are included in the consolidated operating results
of the Company from July1, 1999, the first day of
operations subsequent to the acquisition. The financial
statements reflect the preliminary allocation of the purchase
price, based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition,
pending final determination of certain acquired balances,
principally inventories. Approximately $230 million was
allocated to inventory, leasehold improvements, fixed assets and
favorable lease rights. The excess of the purchase price over the
estimated fair value of the assets acquired resulted in goodwill
of approximately $565 million and is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over 30years.
MO Auto Parts On January6, 1999, the Company acquired two stores in
Alaska from MO Auto Parts for $09 million. The Company has
converted these stores to the Schucks name and store format
and integrated these stores into the Companys operations.
No significant transition and integration costs were incurred
relating to this acquisition.
Trak West On December8, 1997, the Company acquired a newly formed
subsidiary Trak West of Trak Auto Corporation
Trak Auto. Upon its formation, Trak Auto
contributed to Trak West the fixtures and equipment, merchandise
inventories and store leases of 82 specific store sites in
Southern California, together with the merchandise inventory of
the Ontario, California distribution center operated by Trak
Auto. After this contribution, Trak West had no liabilities and
owned no other assets than those previously described. The Company acquired Trak West for a total cost of approximately
$345 million and financed its acquisition with a $220 million
equity investment by affiliates of the Companys existing
stockholders and borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility. In
connection therewith, an affiliate of Investcorp S.A., was paid a
$10 million placement fee. In connection with the negotiation
of the Trak West acquisition, TG Investments, Ltd., an affiliate
of Carmel, was paid a $10 million consulting fee. The Trak West acquisition was accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of
these stores are included in the consolidated operating results
of the Company from December9, 1997, the first day of
operations subsequent to the acquisition, and were not material
to the Companys consolidated results of operations for
fiscal1997. No goodwill was recorded in connection with
this acquisition. The Company incurred $31 million and $34 million of one-time
transition and integration expenses during fiscal1998 and
fiscal1997, respectively, associated with the Trak West
acquisition. Such expenses included the costs of employee
training, remerchandising and grand opening advertising for the
former Trak West stores.

Note4 Transactions and Relationships with
Related Parties In October1989, the Company entered into a nine year lease
the Initial Lease for its corporate headquarters in
Phoenix, Arizona, with an unaffiliated landlord. During
January1994, Missouri Falls Holdings Corp., an affiliate of
Carmel, acquired an interest in the partnership Missouri
Falls Partners which acquired the building and assumed the
lease between the Company and the former landlord. In
October1996, the Company extended the Initial Lease through
October2006. The lease relates to approximately 78,577
square feet and provides for a current base rent of approximately
$1,490,000 per year. The Company is currently negotiating an
extension for the term of the Initial Lease. In April1995, the Company assumed a lease the
Subsequent Lease between a former tenant and
Missouri Falls Partners for approximately 11,683 square feet of
additional office space at its corporate headquarters. In
October1996, the Company extended the Subsequent Lease
through October2006. At its originally scheduled
termination as of April1998, rent under the Subsequent
Lease increased to the same per square foot as is charged under
the Initial Lease to a total annual rent of $221,510. The Company
is currently negotiating an extension of the term of the
Subsequent Lease. The Company leased approximately 5,754 square feet of additional
space at the above premises for an annual rental of $106,449
under three separate lease documents with expiration dates of
February2000 and March2000. The Company has vacated
approximately 2,458 square feet of space for which the lease has
expired. The Company is presently negotiating for an extension of
the lease on the remaining 3,296 square feet and for a new lease
of other space in the same premises. The Company also leases from MFPHoldings, LLC, an affiliate
of Carmel, a parking lot adjacent to its corporate headquarters
for an annual rental of $62,506 under a separate lease which
expires in October2006. From time to time, the Company has entered into sale-leaseback or
other financing arrangements with related parties. Beginning in October1995, the Company entered into a series
of sale-leaseback transactions with Transatlantic Realty, Inc.
Realty, another affiliate of Carmel, for various
real property and fixtures. The total funding provided by Realty
in these transactions through January30, 2000 was
approximately $331 million of which $273 million was for real
property and $58 million was for fixtures. This amount
represented the Companys cost of such assets. The Company
has replaced approximately $273 million of the real property
sale-leasebacks and $53 million of the fixture sale-leasebacks
with similar arrangements with unrelated third parties. As of
January30, 2000, there were approximately $05 million of
fixture sale-leasebacks remaining in this facility. The Company
intends to continue to replace such sale-leasebacks and has
agreed to use its best efforts to do so. Beginning in October1996, the Company entered into a series
of sale-leaseback transactions with Transatlantic Leasing, Inc.
Leasing, another affiliate of Carmel, for certain
real property. The terms of the leases under the facility with
Leasing were set in arms-length negotiations. As of
January30, 2000, the net funding provided by Leasing in
these transactions was approximately $09 million. In
October1997, the Company established a new sale-leaseback
facility and the Company terminated the facility with Leasing. The Company believes that the terms of the transactions with
affiliated parties described above in this Note were no less
favorable to it than terms that may have been available from
independent third parties at the time of the applicable
transaction. In connection with his engagement as Chief Executive Officer, the
Company loaned Mr.Jenkins $550,000, which he used to
finance the purchase of the new home required as a result of his
relocation. This loan was to mature in 1999 and bear interest at
a rate of 4545%. This loan was authorized by the Board of
Directors prior to the commencement of Mr.Jenkins
employment. In September 1999, the Company agreed to forgive
$300,000 principal amount of the loan on November1, 1999
and $250,000 principal amount 42 CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued together with approximately $18,000 accrued and unpaid interest
thereon on February1, 2000, provided that Mr.Jenkins
remained employed on such date unless his failure to remain
employed was caused by our termination of his employment.

the Facility to provide
43 CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued additional funding for the consummation of the Big Wheel
acquisition in June1999. As amended and restated, as of
January30, 2000, the Senior Credit Facility includes the
following significant provisions Maximum borrowing capacity of $5457 million comprised of three
term loans totaling $4207 million $4198 million of which was
outstanding as of January30, 2000 and a revolving credit
commitment totaling $1250 million Interest and commitment fees at variable rates as provided within
a pricing grid that increases as the Companys leverage
ratio increases with the rates commencing at LIBOR plus 25% on
the term loans, LIBOR plus 225% on the revolving credit
commitment and commitment fees of 05% of undrawn availability An increase in the covenant restriction on capital expenditures
to $500 million from $400 million and certain other adjustments
to previously existing financial covenant levels. Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility are collateralized by
a first priority security interest in substantially all of the
personal property of Auto, subject to certain permitted liens.
The Company also issued a guarantee of such borrowings under the
Senior Credit Facility, which guarantee is collateralized by a
pledge by the Company of all issued and outstanding capital stock
of Auto. In addition, the revolving credit portion allows for
the issuance of letters of credit that reduce revolver
availability. Letters of credit outstanding were $29 million and
$06 million at January30, 2000 and January31, 1999,
respectively. The Senior Credit Facility prohibits, with certain limited
exceptions, the optional or mandatory prepayment or other
defeasance of Autos 11% Senior Subordinated Notes. The
Senior Credit Facility further requires that, under certain
circumstances, Auto make prepayments of the term loan outstanding
thereunder with i50% of any Excess Cash Flow as defined
therein; and ii50% of the Net Proceeds as defined
therein from certain offerings of the Companys voting
stock. In addition, a change of control allows the
lenders to accelerate the loans. A change of control occurs under
any of the following circumstances: ianyone, other than
the Initial Shareholders as defined therein, acquires the power
to vote at least 30% of the common stock, on a fully diluted
basis as defined; iicertain changes in the composition
of the Board of Directors; and iiiany sale of the common
stock of Auto. Commitment fees on available funds under the Revolving Credit
Commitment are payable quarterly in arrears on the average
daily-unused amount of the total commitment. Commitment fees
totaling $103,000 and $295,000 were incurred in fiscal 1999 and
1998, respectively. The terms of the Senior Credit Facility include restrictions on
investments, capital expenditures, dividends and certain other
payments and require the Company to meet certain financial
covenants. The Company believes it was in compliance with all
such covenants at January30, 2000.
11% Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2006 On October30, 1996, Auto issued and sold in a private
placement $1250 million aggregate principal amount of 11% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2006 the Old 11%Notes
pursuant to an indenture, between Auto and The Bank of New York
as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee. On
March13, 1997, Auto offered to exchange up to all
outstanding Old 11% Notes for a like principal amount of its 11%
SeriesA Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006 the 11%
Senior Subordinated Notes issued pursuant to the Indenture
in a transaction registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended. Auto consummated the exchange offer on June18,
1997, with all of the Old 11% Notes being exchanged for the 11%
Senior Subordinated Notes. In April1998, 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the
11% Senior Subordinated Notes was redeemed at a redemption price
of 110% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest
44 CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued thereon, to the redemption date, with the net proceeds of an
initial public offering of Common Stock. See Note8. The indenture potentially restricts Auto from making additional
borrowings under its Revolving Credit Commitment that, when added
to the aggregate amount of outstanding borrowings under the
Senior Credit Facility including term loans, exceed $2000
million. This restriction does not apply if the new borrowings
are of a type specifically permitted by the indenture, or, if
after giving pro forma effect to such new borrowings the ratio of
Autos consolidated EBITDA to fixed charges as such terms
are defined in the indenture exceeds 225 to 1. Accordingly, the
Company has been able to exceed the potential restriction and
does not anticipate that it will limit access to further
borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility. The indenture also provides that upon a change of
control, as defined therein, each holder of 11% Senior
Subordinated Notes will have the right to require Auto to
repurchase all or any part of such holders notes at a
purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. The 11% Senior Subordinated Notes bear interest at 11% per year,
payable semiannually in arrears on each May1 and
November1, and mature on November1, 2006. The
11% Senior Subordinated Notes are general, unsecured senior
subordinated obligations. The 11% Senior Subordinated Notes are
required to be guaranteed fully, unconditionally and jointly and
severally by most future United States subsidiaries of Auto, on a
senior subordinated basis. On and after November1, 2001, the 11% Senior Subordinated
Notes will be redeemable, at the option of Auto, in whole or in
part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60days
notice, at the redemption prices set forth below expressed in
percentages of principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
interest thereon, if any, to the applicable redemption date, if

extraordinary loss of approximately $68 million, net of taxes.
Such extraordinary loss consisted primarily of the premiums paid
in connection with the redemption of indebtedness and the
write-off of a portion of deferred debt issuance costs.
Note 7 Leases The Company leases its office and warehouse facilities, all but
four of its retail stores, and a majority of its equipment.
Generally, store leases provide for minimum rentals and the
payment of utilities, maintenance, insurance and taxes. Certain
store leases also provide for contingent rentals based upon a
percentage of sales in excess of a stipulated minimum. The
majority of lease agreements are for base lease periods ranging
from 15 to 20years, with three to five renewal options of
five years each. The Company also has access to an off-balance sheet operating
lease facility that is used to finance new store construction.
The facility provides up to $1122 million of funding for the
acquisition and development of up to 94 new stores through
December31, 2000. As of January30, 2000, $46 million
of this $1122 million leasing facility had been utilized. Under
a similar agreement that expired on May31, 1999 with
respect to the addition of new stores, the Company had
approximately $876 million committed, with $105 million

Note 8 Capital Stock and Initial Public Offering In December1997, the Company sold 180,600 shares of its
ClassB stock to certain executives of the Company. Also in
December1997, in connection with the acquisition of Trak
West, the Company sold 1,827,788 shares of stock to affiliates of
the Companys existing stockholders. See Note 9. On March17, 1998, the Company completed an initial public
offering the IPO of approximately 86 million
shares of its common stock, generating proceeds of approximately
$1591 million, net of offering expenses. The offering proceeds
were used to retire the Companys 12% Subordinated Notes and
other indebtedness as more fully described in Note6. Upon
retirement of the 12% Subordinated Notes, all of the outstanding
preferred stock of Auto was cancelled.
47 CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Plan the Executive Plan and together with the
Associate Plan, the Plans in order to provide
incentives to store managers and salaried corporate and warehouse
employees of the Company. In October1996 and
February1997, the Companys Board of Directors
approved the Associate Plan and the Executive Plan, respectively. The Plans may be administered by a committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company, which would have broad authority in
administering and interpreting the Plans, or, if a committee has
not been appointed, by the entire Board of Directors. The Plans
provide that, at such time as the Company has a class of equity
48 CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued securities registered under Section12 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act,
the committee must consist entirely of Non-Employee
Directors as defined in Rule16b-3 under the Exchange
Act. The Compensation Committee has been appointed to
administer the Plans. Options to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,026,300 shares of
common stock may be granted under the Associate Plan. On
April30, 1999, the Board of Directors amended and restated
the Executive Plan, increasing the maximum number of shares for
which options may be granted by 60,000 to a total of 744,200
shares of common stock. Options granted under the Plans may be
options intended to qualify as incentive stock options under

amended, or options not intended to so qualify. In the event of a
sale of more than 80% of the outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Company or 80% of its assets, as defined, all options
under the plan are vested. All options expire on the seventh
anniversary of the date of grant or, under certain
circumstances, 30days later. As a result of the IPO, each option granted under the Plans will
become exercisable upon vesting. Options granted under the
Associate Plan vest in three equal installments on the second,
third and fourth anniversaries of the date of their grant,
assuming the associates employment continues during this
period Four Year Vesting. Options granted under the
Executive Plan are subject to the Four Year Vesting as to 84% of
such options and performance vesting over the same four years
as to the remaining 16%. The performance vesting criteria is
based upon achieving specified operating results. Partial vesting
of options subject to performance vesting occurs if the Company
achieves less than 95% of the specified operating results. Any
portion of options granted under the Executive Plan which are
subject to performance vesting and which do not vest during the
four years will automatically vest 90 days prior to the end of
the options term. If the specified operating results are
exceeded for any year by at least 10%, the executive will receive
options for up to an additional 5% 20% on a cumulative basis
of his or her original option grant. Based on 1998 results, an
additional 8,713 options were granted in April1999. Based
on 1999 results, approximately 15,000 options will be granted in
April2000. As of January30, 2000, the Company has granted options to
purchase 878,455 shares under the Associate Plan and 607,707
shares under the Executive Plan, net of cancellations and
exercises. Except for 96,062 options granted under the Executive
Plan see Employment Agreements below, the exercise
prices represent the fair market value at the date of grant based
upon the price paid for such shares and other valuation analyses
performed by the Company, or actual market prices as determined
by trades reported by the New York Stock Exchange subsequent to
the IPO, as applicable.
1999 Stock Option Plan On April30, 1999, the Company adopted the 1999 Employee
Stock Option Plan the 1999 Plan in order to
attract, retain and motivate qualified individuals to serve as
employees of the Company. The 1999 Plan is administered by a committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company, which has broad authority in
administering and interpreting the plan. The 1999 Plan provides
that, at such time as the Company has a class of equity
securities registered under Section12 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act,
the committee must consist entirely of Non-Employee
Directors as defined in Rule16b-3 under the Exchange
Act. Options to purchase up to an aggregate of 750,000 shares of
common stock may be granted under the 1999 Plan. Options granted
under the 1999 Plan may be options intended to qualify as
incentive stock options under Section422 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or options not intended to so
qualify. In the event of a sale of more than 80% of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or 80% of its
assets, as defined, all options under the plan are vested. All
options expire on the tenth anniversary of the date of grant or,
under certain circumstances, 30days later.
49 CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued As of January30, 2000, the Company has granted options to
purchase 533,020 shares under the 1999 Plan, net of cancellations
and exercises. The exercise prices represent the fair market
value at the date of grant based upon actual market prices as
determined by trades reported by the New York Stock Exchange.
Options granted under the 1999 Plan vest and become exercisable
as determined by the Board of Directors.
Directors Stock Plan Directors who are currently associated with the Investcorp Group
or the Carmel Group do not currently receive any compensation for
serving as directors. In June1998, the Companys
Board of Directors adopted a non-employee director compensation
plan, which was approved in June1999. The plan provides for
an aggregate of up to 50,000 shares in the form of restricted
stock grants or stock options. The Board of Directors has adopted
a policy which provides the two non-employee directors who are
not associated with the Investcorp Group or the Carmel Group with
an annual stipend of $25,000, of which at least $10,000 must be
paid in the form of restricted stock grants. Pursuant to this
Plan, two Directors were granted a total of 1,534 and 1,516
shares of restricted stock during fiscal 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
Employment Agreements Auto has entered into an employment agreement with its Chairman
pursuant to which he is paid a fixed base salary and eligible for
a bonus based upon earnings per share. The agreement does not
contain a stated termination date, but rather is terminable at
will by either party. If Auto were to terminate the employment of
the Chairman without cause, or if he terminates his employment
for good reason, Auto has agreed to pay to the Chairman his base
salary and performance bonus for a period of 24months. The
Chairman also received a loan of $550,000 from the Company,
bearing interest at 4545%. In consideration of the
chairmans efforts regarding the Companys acquisitions
see Note3, $300,000 was forgiven during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1999, with the remaining balance to be forgiven
in the first quarter of fiscal 2000. Auto had entered into an
employment agreement with its President pursuant to which he was
paid a base salary and a bonus based upon earnings per share. The
agreement was terminated effective April1, 2000 in
connection with the Presidents retirement from day-to-day
operations. In connection with the commencement of his employment, the
Company agreed to pay the Chairman $10 million which, in turn,
was used by the Chairman to purchase 83,079 shares of common
stock from a member of the Investcorp Group, reflecting a share
value of $1204, the fair market value at the date of the
agreement, based on the price paid for such shares in the 1996
Recapitalization. The Company also loaned the Chairman
approximately $440,000 to pay the income tax consequences of the
award. The loan bears interest at the rate applicable to
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Commitment. This loan was
paid in full in December1998. In connection with the execution of his employment agreement, the
Companys Chairman received an option for 401,967 shares of
common stock, exercisable at $1204 per share. As of
January30, 2000, this option had vested to the extent of
200,982 shares. As a result of vesting acceleration triggered by
the IPO, this option will generally vest and become exercisable
in March 2000, subject to earlier vesting based upon the
achievement of certain EBITDA targets and the occurrence of other
specified events. In connection with the Trak West acquisition,
the Companys Chairman received an option for 39,940 shares
of common stock, exercisable at $1204 per share, effective as of
February1, 1998. This option will vest and become
exercisable in four equal annual installments beginning in
April1999. In connection with the issuance of these
options, the Company will recognize a charge to earnings of
approximately $02 million over the vesting period for the
difference between the exercise price and the fair market value
of the common stock at the date of grant. In connection with the
IPO, the Companys Chairman received an option for 216,635
shares of common stock, exercisable at $2000 per share, the fair
market value at the date of grant based on the IPO. This option
will vest and become exercisable in three equal annual
installments beginning in April2000.
50 CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued In connection with the execution of his employment agreement, the
Companys President received an option for 299,337 shares
of common stock, exercisable at $1204 per share. This option has
both vested and become exercisable to the extent of 171,048
shares. As a result of vesting acceleration triggered by the IPO,
the remainder of this option vested and became exercisable in
March2000.
Management Stock Purchase Agreements and Loans
Plans In December1997, the Company entered into stock purchase
agreements with certain executives of the Company. Under the
terms of the agreements, the Company agreed to issue a total of
180,600 shares of its common stock at a price of $1204 per
share, the same price paid in the 1996 Recapitalization. In
addition, the Company granted certain executives non-qualified
options to purchase 96,058 shares of its common stock, also at a
price of $1204 per share. The options contain similar terms and
vesting provisions as existing options under the Companys
Executive Stock Option Plan. In connection with the issuance of
these shares, the Company recognized a charge to earnings of $09
million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997 for the difference
between the issuance price and the fair market value of the stock
at the date of sale. In addition, in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 1997, the Company recorded deferred compensation of
approximately $05 million to reflect the difference between the
exercise price and the fair market value of stock associated with
the options granted to certain executives. The deferred
compensation will produce a charge to earnings over the vesting
period of the options. Of the total consideration paid to the Company of $22 million in
connection with the purchase of the Companys common stock
by certain executives, approximately $10 million was loaned by
the Company to certain executives to purchase 84,542 of the
shares the Stock Loans. The Stock Loans are
collateralized by the stock under pledge agreements, provide full
recourse to the executive, bear interest at the average rate
paid by the Company under the revolving portion of its Senior
Credit Facility, and mature in December2003.

$22 million as of January30, 2000 reflecting the benefit
of federal tax loss carryforwards totaling $64 million which
begin to expire in 2013. Realization is dependent on generating
sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss
carryforwards. Utilization of certain of the net operating loss
carryforwards may be limited under Section382 of the
Internal Revenue Code. Although realization is not assured,
management believes it is more likely than not that all the
deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, the Company
believes that no valuation allowance is required for deferred tax
assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities. The amount of the
deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be
reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income
during the carryforward period are reduced.
Note12Store Closing Costs The Company provides an allowance for estimated costs and losses
to be incurred in connection with store closures. For stores to
be closed, such costs are recognized when a store is specifically
identified, costs can be estimated and closure is planned to be
completed within the next twelve months prior to
January31, 1999, eighteen months. For stores to be
relocated, such costs are recognized when an agreement for the
new location has been reached with a landlord and site plans meet
preliminary municipal approvals. The allowance for store closing
costs is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying
financial statements, and consists primarily of future rents to
be paid over the remaining terms of the master lease agreement
for stores, net of estimated sub-lease recoveries. Future rents
will be incurred through the expiration of the non-cancelable
leases, the longest of which run through June 2014.
54 CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued Activity in the provision for store closings and the related
store closing costs for the three years ended January30,
2000, is as follows in thousands Fiscal Year 1999 1998 1997 Balance, beginning of year 2,670 8,379 10,794 Store closing costs Store closing costs, gross 5,252 1,925 3,103 Adjustments to prior year plans 387 620 1,431 Revisions in estimates 35 970 32 Store closing costs, net 4,900 335 1,640 Purchase accounting adjustments Trak West 625 Big Wheel 98 Als and Grand Auto Supply 4,080 Total purchase accounting adjustments 4,178 625 Payments 6,946 6,044 4,680 Balance, end of year 4,802 2,670 8,379 During the period that they remain open for business, the rent
and other operating expenses for the stores to be closed continue
to be reflected in the Companys normal operating expenses.
Included in store closing costs for fiscal 1999 is a charge of
$25 million for store closing costs that were incurred due to
overlap of certain CSK stores with more favorably sized or
situated stores acquired from Als and Grand Auto Supply. As part of the purchase price allocation for the Trak West, Big
Wheel and AGA stores see Note3, the Company recorded an
allowance for the costs of closing or relocating certain stores. Adjustments to prior plans relate to costs for store closures
that were accrued in prior years but withdrawn from the
Companys store closure plan in the year of adjustment. Such
withdrawals are due to subsequent improvements in the underlying
economics of the stores performance or in the case of
store relocation because the Company was unable to secure a
previously identified site upon acceptable lease terms. The
Company had significant adjustments to prior year plans in 1997
and 1998 because of changes resulting from higher than expected
improvements in its gross profit margins in 1997-1998 and changes
resulting from the Trak West Acquisition see Note3 and
the IPO see Note8. Further significant changes to the
strategic plan are not considered likely. All relocations and
store closings are anticipated to be completed within twelve
months of accrual and only after costs can be estimated. Other cost revisions are comprised of changes in expected future
rental costs for vacant or sub-leased store locations, which are
due largely to early terminations of lease agreements. On a store count basis, activity and the remaining number of
stores to be closed are summarized as follows Number of Stores to be Closed Beginning Plan Balance to Fiscal Year Balance Stores Added Amendments Stores Closed be Closed 1997 56 36 15 29 48 1998 48 24 10 33 29 1999 29 87 11 77 28 55 CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued At January30, 2000, there were 28stores remaining to
be closed under the Companys store closing plans, comprised
of the following Stores in Plan Balance to Fiscal Year Closing Plan Amendments Stores Closed be Closed 1996 91 17 73 1 1997 36 13 20 3 1998 24 5 19 1999 87 1 62 24 28 Note13 Legal Matters On May4, 1998, a lawsuit was filed against the Company in
the Superior Court in San Diego, California. The case was brought
by two former store managers and a former senior assistant
manager. It purports to be a class action for all present and
former California store managers and senior assistant managers
and seeks overtime pay for a period beginning in May 1995 as well
as injunctive relief requiring overtime pay in the future. The
Company has also been served with two other lawsuits purporting
to be class actions filed in California state courts in Orange
and Fresno Counties by thirteen other former and current
employees. These lawsuits include similar claims to the San Diego
lawsuit, except that they also include claims for unfair
business practices which seek overtime from October 1994. The
Orange County lawsuit initially included claims for punitive
damages and unlawful conversion, but the Court subsequently
dismissed both of these claims. The three cases have been coordinated before one
judge in San Diego County. Discovery has been conducted by the
parties. On January19, 2000, as amended on January27,
2000, the judge issued an order allowing the coordinated
lawsuits to proceed as class actions, with class periods of May
1994 through January 2000 for store managers and October 1994
through July 1997 for senior assistant managers. The Company
filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate seeking appellate review of
the foregoing order which was not successful. On March23,
2000, the Company filed a Petition for Review by the California
Supreme Court to have the trial courts order reversed. Although the Company cannot estimate the potential loss or range
of loss at this time, if these cases are permitted to proceed as
class actions and are decided against it, the Company believes
that the aggregate potential exposure could be material to
results of operations or cash flows for the year in which the
cases are ultimately decided. However, the Company does not
believe that such an adverse outcome, if it were to happen, would
materially affect its financial position, or its operations or
cash flows in subsequent periods. Although at this stage in the
litigation it is difficult to predict its outcome with any
certainty, the Company believes that there are meritorious
defenses to these cases and intends to defend them vigorously. The Company was served on March8, 2000 with a complaint
filed in Federal Court in the Eastern District of New York by the
Coalition for a Level Playing Field, L.L.C. and
179individual auto parts dealers alleging that the Company
and seven other auto parts dealers AutoZone, Inc., Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc., Advance Stores Company, Inc., Discount Auto, Inc.,
The Pep Boys Manny, Moe and Jack, Inc., OReilly
Automotive, Inc., and Keystone Automotive Operations, Inc.
violated the Robinson-Patman Act. Only 14 of the individual
plaintiffs asserted claims against the Company, and three of
those have voluntarily dismissed their claims without prejudice.
The complaint alleges that the Company and other defendants
knowingly either induced or received discriminatory prices from
large suppliers, allegedly in violation of Section2a
and2f of the Robinson-Patman Act, as well as receiving
compensation from large suppliers for services not performed for
those suppliers, allegedly in violation of Section2c of
the Robinson-Patman Act. The complaint seeks injunctive relief
against all defendants and seeks treble damages on behalf of the
individual
56 CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued auto parts dealers who are plaintiffs, plus attorneys fees.
The complaint alleges that the estimated average damage amount
per plaintiff is $1,000,000 and more for those plaintiffs that
are wholesale distributors and not simply jobbers before
trebling. The Company believes the suit is without merit and
plans to vigorously defend it. The Company currently and from time to time is involved in other
litigation incidental to the conduct of its business. The damages
claimed in some of this litigation are substantial. Although the
amount of liability that may result from these matters cannot be
ascertained, the Company does not currently believe that, in the
aggregate, they will result in liabilities material to its
consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows.
Note 14 Fair Value of Financial Instruments The estimated fair values of the Companys financial
instruments, which are determined by reference to quoted market
prices, where available, or are based upon comparisons to similar
instruments of comparable maturities, are as follows in

agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of All-Car
Distributors, Inc. AllCar, an operator of 22 stores
in Wisconsin and Michigan. Under the terms of the agreement, the
Company will pay approximately $865,000 in cash for the assets
of AllCar and will assume vendor accounts payable and certain
indebtedness and accrued expenses. The closing, which is subject
to the satisfaction of certain conditions, is expected to occur
on April27, 2000. The acquisition of the 22 AllCar stores
gives the Company an immediate presence of scale in a
strategically important market adjacent to our current
operations. The acquired stores will be serviced out of its
Minneapolis Distribution Center and will be converted to the
Checker Auto Parts name. During January2000, the Company entered into a definitive
agreement with Advance Auto Parts and Sequoia Capital to form a
new joint venture, PartsAmerica.com, which is expected to become
one of the largest automotive parts and accessories e-commerce
destinations in the $90 billion automotive parts and accessories
market. PartsAmerica.com will operate independently from its
partners and will utilize both CSKs and Advances
existing logistic systems to suport its web-based operations.
PartsAmerica.com will offer both retail and commercial customers
the widest available selection of automotive parts and delivery
options, including same-day delivery, local in-store pickup, and
overnight shipment. In addition, because of 50-state coverage,
customers will be able to return or exchange merchandise at their
local CSK or Advance Auto Parts store. The Company has
contributed the use of the e-commerce capabilities of its
existing web site and certain other assets to the joint venture.
The Company is a party to a service agreement with
PartsAmerica.com that governs the terms of our sale of
merchandise to PartsAmerica.com and certain other services that
the Company is to provide to the joint venture. PartsAmerica.com
is expected to commence operations in July2000.
