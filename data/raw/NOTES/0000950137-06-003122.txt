To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of PCTEL, Inc.   We have completed integrated audits of PCTEL, Inc. 2005 and 2004
consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003 consolidated
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits,
are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of PCTEL Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion,
the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of
financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Internal control over financial reporting
Also, we have audited management assessment, included in Management
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A,
that PCTEL, Inc. did not maintain effective controls over the review,
completeness and accuracy of its provision for income taxes and the related
financial statement presentation and disclosure of income tax matters based on
criteria established in Internal Control -- Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The
Company management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
management assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of
internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinions.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; ii
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
36 directors of the company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control
deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material
misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected. As of December 31, 2005, the Company did not maintain effective
controls over the review, completeness and accuracy of its provision for income
taxes and the related financial statement presentation and disclosure of income
tax matters. This control deficiency resulted in audit adjustments to the 2005
annual consolidated financial statements with respect to income tax disclosures
and the 2005 second quarter consolidated financial statements with respect to
the provision for income taxes. In addition, this control deficiency could
result in a misstatement of the income tax provision and income tax related
financial statement disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of
the annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or
detected. Accordingly, management has concluded that this control deficiency
constitutes a material weakness. This material weakness was considered in
determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit
of the 2005 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the
effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting does
not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
As described in Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting, management has excluded Sigma Wireless Technologies Sigma, from
its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005 because it was acquired by the Company through a purchase business
combination in July 2005. We have also excluded Sigma from our audit of internal
control over financial reporting. Sigma is a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company that represents 21% of consolidated total assets and 5% of consolidated
revenues, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005.
In our opinion, management assessment that PCTEL, Inc. did not maintain
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in
Internal Control -- Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. Also, in our
opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the
achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, PCTEL, Inc. has not
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control -- Integrated
Framework issued by the COSO.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED: DECEMBER 31, 2005
NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
NATURE OF OPERATIONS
PCTEL was incorporated in California in 1994 and reincorporated in Delaware
in 1998. PCTEL provides wireless connectivity products and technology to
wireless carriers, aggregators of Internet connectivity, wireless Internet
service providers WISP, PC OEM, and wireless equipment manufacturers. The
company brings together expertise in RF platform design, mobility software, and
hardware. PCTEL simplifies mobility, provides wireless intelligence, and
enhances wireless performance. Additionally, the company licenses both patented
and proprietary access technology, principally related to analog modems, to
modem solution providers.
The company principally operates in four business segments.
Antenna Products Group
The Antenna Products Group APG product line consists of wireless
communication antennas designed to enhance the performance of broadband
wireless, in-building wireless, wireless Internet service providers and Land
Mobile Radio LMR applications. The Antenna Products Group was formed around
the business of MAXRAD, Inc, which was acquired in January 2004. As a result of
the October 2004 acquisition of certain antenna product lines from Andrew
Corporation Andrew, APG expanded the product line to include GPS Global
Positioning Systems, satellite communications Mobile SATCOM and on-glass
mobile antennas. In July 2005, the company again expanded the product line with
the purchase of Sigma Wireless Technologies Sigma or SWT, located in
Dublin, Ireland. Sigma provides integrated variable electrical tilt base
stations antennas iVET, Public Mobile Radio PMR, and Digital Public Mobile
Radio DPMR antenna products.
RF Solutions Group
The RF Solutions Group RFSG product line consists of software-defined
radio products designed to measure and monitor cellular networks. The RF
Solutions Group was formed around the business of DTI, Inc., which was acquired
in March 2003. The technology is sold in three forms; as OEM radio frequency
receivers, as integrated systems solutions, and as components and systems to
U.S. government agencies.
Mobility Solutions Group
The Mobility Solutions Group MSG produces Wi-Fi and Cellular Mobility
Software products. This family of solutions simplifies access to both wired and
wireless data networks.
Licensing
PCTEL has an intellectual property portfolio consisting of over 130 U.S.
patents and applications, primarily in analog modem technology. It also has
proprietary DSP based embedded modem technology. Independent of the three
product lines, the company has an active licensing program designed to monetize
its intellectual property.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The company uses the United States dollar as the functional currency for
the financial statements. The company uses the local currency as the functional
currency for its subsidiaries in China Yuan, Ireland euro, and Japan Yen.
Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated to U.S. dollars at the
exchange rate in effect at the applicable balance sheet date, and revenues and
expenses are translated using
42
PCTEL, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED: DECEMBER 31, 2005
average exchange rates prevailing during that period. Translation gains losses
are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of
stockholders' equity. All gains and losses resulting from other transactions
originally in foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars are
included in net income. At December 31, 2005 the cumulative translation
adjustment was negative $168,000. The company uses the U.S. dollar as the
functional currency for its subsidiaries in Israel and for its branch office in
Hong Kong. These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PCTEL
and its subsidiaries after eliminating intercompany accounts and transactions.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods
reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to
the current period presentation.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Financial instruments are divided into two different classifications      Cash equivalents:   Money market funds that have an original
maturity of 90 days or less.
Restricted cash:   Certificates of deposit that support a stand-by
letter of credit in connection with facility
lease obligations and are restricted for use by
the company.
The carrying amounts reported for cash equivalents is considered to
approximate fair values based upon the short maturities of these financial
statements.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK AND OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The company is subject to certain risks including the impact of the
continued economic slowdown, the company ability to develop and successfully
introduce new and enhanced products such as wireless products, the outcome of
potential litigation involving intellectual property, competition from larger,
more established companies and dependence on key suppliers.
Financial instruments that potentially subject the company to credit risk
consist primarily of trade receivables. There were no short-term investments at
December 31, 2005. The company maintains a portfolio of cash equivalents with
reputable financial institutions and money market funds.
For trade receivables, credit risk is the potential for a loss due to a
customer not meeting its payment obligations. PCTEL customers are concentrated
in the wireless industry. Estimates are used in determining an allowance for
amounts, which the company may not be able to collect, based on current trends,
the length of time receivables are past due and historical collection
experience. Provisions for and recovery of bad debts are recorded against sales
and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
The company performs ongoing evaluations of customers' credit limits
financial condition and generally require no collateral. As of December 31,
2005, the credit risk was diversified as a result of acquisitions. One customer
accounted for 16% of gross accounts receivable with the next largest balance
accounting for 5%. As

PCTEL, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED: DECEMBER 31, 2005
of December 31, 2004, one customer accounted for 11% of gross accounts
receivable with the next largest balance accounting for 6%.
The market for PCTEL products is characterized by frequent transitions in
which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards. A
failure to develop products with required features or performance standards or a
delay in bringing a new product to market could adversely affect the operating
results. In addition, due to competitive pricing pressures that affect the
products and in part to increasing component and manufacturing costs, the
company expects gross margins from both existing and future products to decrease
over time.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include material,
labor and overhead costs using the FIFO method of costing. Inventories as of
December 31, 2005 were composed of raw materials, sub assemblies, finished goods
and work-in-process. The company regularly monitors inventory quantities on hand
and, based on the current estimated requirements, it was determined that any
excess inventory was reserved as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. Due to
competitive pressures and technological innovation, there may be excess
inventory in the future. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the
allowance for inventory losses was $09 million and $04 million, respectively.
The company recovered $18 million of the former write-downs related to the
modem inventory during the year ended December 31, 2003. Write-downs of
inventories would have a negative impact on gross margin.
Inventories consist of the following in thousands                                DECEMBER 31,

Depreciation expense was approximately $17, $11 and $07 million for the

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
The company accounts for software development costs in accordance with SFAS
No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or
Otherwise Marketed. The company products include a software component. To
date, the company has expensed all software development costs because costs
incurred subsequent to the products reaching technological feasibility were not
significant.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The company sells antenna products, software defined radio products, and
licenses the modem technology through the licensing program. The company records
the sale of these products, including related maintenance, and the licensing of
the intellectual property as revenue.
In accordance with SAB No. 104, the company recognizes revenue when the
following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, price is fixed and
determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. The company recognizes
revenue for sales of the antenna products and software defined radio products,
when title transfers, which is generally upon shipment from the factory. PCTEL
sells these products into both commercial and secure application government
markets. Title for sales into the commercial markets generally transfers upon
shipment from the factory. Products that are sold into the secure application
government market are generally designed to a unique specification. Title for
sales into the government markets generally does not transfer until acceptance
for the first units and then upon shipment thereafter. Revenue is recognized for
antenna products sold to major distributors upon shipment from the factory. The
company allows its major antenna product distributors to return product under
specified terms and conditions. The company accrues for product returns in
accordance with FAS 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists.
45
PCTEL, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED: DECEMBER 31, 2005
The company recognizes revenue from the Wi-Fi and cellular mobility
software, including related maintenance rights, under SOP 97-2 Software Revenue
Recognition. If the software license is perpetual and vendor specific objective
evidence can be established for the software license and any related maintenance
rights, the software license revenue is recognized upon delivery of the software
and the maintenance is recorded pro-rata over the life of the maintenance
rights. If part of the licensing agreement requires engineering services to
customize software for the customer needs, the revenue for these services is
recognized when the initial software license is delivered. If vendor specific
objective evidence cannot be established, and the only undelivered item is
maintenance, the software license revenue, the revenue associated with
engineering services, if applicable, and the related maintenance rights are
combined and recognized pro-rata over the expected term of the maintenance
rights. If vendor specific evidence cannot be established on any of the
non-maintenance elements, the revenue is recorded pro-rata over the life of the
contractual obligation.
The company records intellectual property licensing revenue when; it has a
licensing agreement, the amount of related royalties is known for the accounting
period reported, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Knowledge of the
royalty amount specific to an accounting period is either in the form of a
royalty report specific to a quarter, a contractual fixed payment in the license
agreement specific to a quarter, or the pro-rata amortization of a fixed payment
related to multiple quarters over those quarters using the operating lease
method. If a license agreement provides for a fixed payment related to periods
prior to the license effective date the past and volume-based royalties going
forward, the fixed payment is recognized at the license effective date and the
volume based royalties are recognized as royalty reports are received. If the
license provides for a fixed payment for the past and for a finite future
period, to be followed by volume based royalties thereafter, the fixed payment
is recorded under the operating lease method and recognized pro-rata from the
effective date through the end of the period covered by the fixed payment. If a
one-time license payment is made for a perpetual license, with no future
obligations on behalf of us, revenue is recognized under the capitalized lease
method upon the effective date.
There is one exception to the recognition of intellectual property
licensing as revenue. The company signed a licensing agreement with Conexant
simultaneously with the sale of its HSP modem product line to Conexant in 2003.
Because the HSP modem product line also requires a license to the company
patent portfolio, the gain on sale of the product line and the licensing stream
are not separable for accounting purposes. Ongoing royalties from Conexant are
presented in the income statement as Gain on Sale of Assets and Related
Royalties.
WARRANTIES AND SALES RETURNS
The company APG segment allows its major distributors and certain other
customers to return unused product under specified terms and conditions. In
accordance with FAS 48, the company accrues for product returns based on
historical sales and return trends. At December 31, 2005, the company
allowance for sales returns was $247,000.
The company offers repair and replacement warranties of primarily two years
for APG products and one year for RFSG products. At December 31, 2005, the
company warranty reserve was $147,000 for these products based on historical
sales and costs of repair and replacement trends.
R & D COSTS
The company expenses research and development costs as incurred. All costs
incurred prior to establishing the technological feasibility of computer
software products to be sold are research and development costs and expensed as
incurred in accordance with SFAS 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED: DECEMBER 31, 2005
ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS
The company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated
uncollectible accounts receivable. The allowance is based on the company
assessment of known delinquent accounts, historical experience, and other
currently available evidence of the collectability and the aging of accounts
receivable. The company total allowance for doubtful accounts was $03 million
and $05 million at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. The
provision for doubtful accounts is included in sales and marketing expense.
INCOME TAXES
The company provides for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. SFAS No. 109 requires an asset and liability
based approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates.
Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets, which are not
likely to be realized.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
In December 2004 the FASB issued Statement No. 123 revised 2004,
Share-Based Payment SFAS No. 123R, which requires all share-based payments
to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in
the income statement based on their fair values. Under SFAS 123R, the pro forma
disclosure alternative permitted under FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123 and Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation -- Transition and Disclosure SFAS 148 is no longer allowable.
The company will adopt SFAS 123R in the quarter ending March 31, 2006; however,
until then, and as currently permitted by SFAS 123 and SFAS 148, we continue to
apply the accounting provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion Number
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, and related
interpretations, with regard to the measurement of compensation cost for options
granted under our stock option plans.
In fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 no compensation expense was recorded with
respect to stock options granted as all options granted had an exercise price
equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.
In addition, no compensation expense was recorded for purchases under our
Employee Stock Purchase Plan in accordance with APB 25. Had expense been
recognized using the fair value method described in SFAS 123, using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we would have reported the following results

These costs may not be representative of the total effects on reported
income loss for future years. Factors that may also impact future years
include the attribution of the awards to the service period, the vesting period
of stock awards, timing of additional grants of stock option awards and the
number of shares granted for future awards. The company expects the adoption of
SFAS No. 123R to have a material effect on our reported net income loss per
share. While the company intends to continue to use stock options for employee
incentives, the company plans to emphasize the use of restricted stock. The
company estimates that the 2006 impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R will be
approximately $10 million to $15 million before income taxes, which
approximates the annual 2005, 2004 and 2003 pro forma stock-based compensation
expense for stock options as included in the table above. The actual cost will
differ from this range due to changes in assumptions. This estimated range
primarily reflects the impact of expensing stock options for the first time.
In January 2005, the company approved the acceleration of vesting for all
unvested underwater options in order to mitigate the associated future
share-based compensation expense under SFAS 123R. The pro-forma net loss and
pro-forma net loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes the
$38 million impact of the acceleration of the underwater options. There was no
income statement impact related to the acceleration of options for the year
ended December 31, 2005. See discussion on acceleration of options in footnote
10.
The increase in stock compensation expense in the pro-forma results of
operations is due to the acceleration of options and higher restricted stock
amortization, offsetting lower stock compensation expense related to stock
options.
The company calculated the fair value of each option grant on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as prescribed by SFAS 123
using the following assumptions                                 EMPLOYEE STOCK

Expected life in years. 290  303  276  05  05  05   Prior to 2005, the company measured volatility based on a 90-day period.
For the 2005 calculation, the company calculated the volatility based on the
period of January 2001 to December 2005. The company believes five years more
accurately matches the expected term of the options. The stock-based
compensation expense related to stock options in the pro-forma net loss amount
for 2005 in the table above is based on the revised volatility. The total
stock-based compensation expense of $90 million includes $12 million
compensation expense related to stock options. The impact on the 2005 expense
for the change in the volatility measurement was an increase of $01 million. In
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 pro forma stock compensation expense, the company
recognized employee forfeitures as incurred. In 2006, the company will
incorporate a forfeiture rate in the expense calculation. The company does not
expect the effect of using a forfeiture rate for stock options rather than
including forfeiture as incurred to materially impact the stock compensation
expense. In 2006, all other assumptions will be consistent with the assumptions
used for the 2005 option pricing model.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility and expected option life. Because the company employee stock
options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair

PCTEL, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED: DECEMBER 31, 2005
value estimate the existing models may not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of the employee stock options. Based on the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model, the weighted average estimated fair value of
employee stock option grants was $303 for 2005, $363 for 2004, and $279 for
2003. Restricted stock awards are recorded at the fair market value of the stock
on the date of grant and is expensed over the vesting period.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
The company computes earnings per share in accordance with SFAS No. 128,
Earnings Per Share. SFAS No. 128 requires companies to compute net income per
share under two different methods, basic and diluted, and present per share data
for all periods in which statements of operations are presented. Basic earnings
per share is computed by dividing net income/net loss by the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding, less shares subject to repurchase.
Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding. Common
stock equivalents consist of stock options using the treasury stock method.
Common stock options are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per
share if their effect is anti-dilutive. The weighted average common stock option
grants excluded from the calculations of diluted net loss per share were 554,699
for the year ended December 31, 2005.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and
denominators used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively in thousands, except

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
SFAS No. 141 requires all business combinations to be accounted for using
the purchase method. SFAS No. 142 addresses the financial accounting and
reporting standards for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their
initial recognition. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill no longer be amortized.
It also requires that goodwill and other intangible assets be tested for
impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur
indicating that goodwill might be impaired. The company conducted the annual
impairment test of goodwill and long-lived assets as of October 31, 2005. The
estimate of future undiscounted cash flows for this test was based on historical
sales trends, financial projections, market analysis, capital expenditure needs,
working capital needs, analyst reports, and other data pertinent to the
valuation as provided by the company and obtained from public, financial, and
industry sources. The company assumptions required significant judgment and
actual cash flows may differ from those forecasted today. The company believes
the assumptions used for discounting future cash flows were appropriately
conservative. Based on the results of the test, there was no impairment of
goodwill or other intangible assets.
Additionally, an acquired intangible asset should be separately recognized
if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other
legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed,
rented, or exchanged, regardless of the acquirer intent to do so.
Intangible assets consist principally of technology, non-compete
agreements, patents, trademarks and tradenames, and customer relationships and
are amortized over a period of one to eight years.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 107, which provides guidance on the
implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
123R, Share-Based Payment see discussion below. In particular, SAB No. 107
provides key guidance related to valuation methods including assumptions such
as expected volatility and expected term, the accounting for income tax effects
of share-based payment arrangements upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the
modification of employee share options prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R,
the classification of compensation expense, capitalization of compensation cost
related to share-based payment arrangements, first-time adoption of SFAS No.
123R in an interim period, and disclosures in Management Discussion and
Analysis subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. SAB No. 107 became
effective on March 29, 2005. The Company will apply the principles of SAB 107 in
conjunction with its adoption of SFAS 123R in the quarter ending March 2006.
In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes
and Error Corrections , a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement
No. 3. This statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle,
and requires retrospective application to prior periods' financial statements
for changes in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 will be effective for the
company beginning in fiscal year 2007. The company does not believe this
statement will have a material impact on the company financial statements.
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
FAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment. The statement addresses the accounting for
transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for
a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on
the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by
the issuance of such equity instruments. FAS No. 123R is effective no later than
annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2005. The company will adopt FAS
No. 123R on a prospective basis starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
The company expects the adoption of FAS No. 123R to have a material effect on
our reported net income per share. During January 2005 and in advance of the
adoption of FAS No. 123R, the company accelerated the
50
PCTEL, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED: DECEMBER 31, 2005
vesting of out of the money options with a share price equal to or greater
than $1000. Under FAS 123R, the acceleration of these options will result in
PCTEL not being required to recognize share-based compensation expense of
approximately $38 million beginning in the company quarter ending March 31,
2006 and ending in the company quarter ending March 31, 2008. See footnote 10
in the Notes to the Financial Statements.
In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Positions in relation to FAS No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FASB issued FSP FAS 109-1, Application of
FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on
Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004. As a domestic manufacturer, the company will access in 2006 whether the
company is eligible for any tax deductions under this Act. FASB issued FSP FAS
109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Repatriation
Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. At this time the
company does not expect to repatriate the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries
as dividends to take advantage of this tax credit.
In November 2004, the FASB issued FAS No. 151, An Amendment of ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4. The statement amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,
Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material spoilage. FAS
No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2005. The company will adopt FAS 151 in fiscal 2006. Adoption of
FAS No. 151 is not expected to have a material effect on the ongoing operations
of the company.
NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS
Sigma
On July 4, 2005, the company purchased all of the outstanding shares of
Sigma Wireless Technology Limited Sigma. Sigma is based in Dublin, Ireland
and develops, manufactures and distributes antenna products designed for public
safety and for the UMTS cellular networks. Sigma currently employs 87 people in
Ireland and the United Kingdom. The Sigma acquisition expands the company
product lines within its APG segment. With the acquisition of Sigma, the company
gains entry into the growing cellular base station antenna market and also gains
a geographic footprint in Europe.
In exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Sigma, the company paid
cash consideration of 194 million Euro approximately $231 million, plus
assumed an unfunded pension obligation of approximately 25 million Euro
approximately $30 million, and incurred approximately 17 million Euro
approximately $20 million in transaction costs. In addition to the cash
consideration at closing, the selling stockholders of Sigma may earn up to an
additional 75 million Euro approximately $91 million in cash based on
Sigma revenue performance over the 18-month period ending December 31, 2006.
The total purchase price of 236 million Euro approximately $282 million
was allocated $82 million to tangible assets acquired, $78 million to
liabilities assumed, $25 million to core technology, $64 million to customer
relationships, and $01 million to order backlog in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. The intangible assets have a weighted average
amortization period of six years. The $157 million excess of the purchase price
over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets was allocated to
goodwill. The company will amortize the order backlog over one year and the
other intangible assets over six years. The company evaluated the value of the
assets acquired from Sigma. A third-party valuation firm was engaged to assist
in the evaluation.

In May 2003, the company completed the sale of certain of its assets to
Conexant Systems, Inc., Conexant. Conexant is a supplier of semiconductor
system solutions for communications applications. In connection with the
transaction, the company and Conexant entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement
dated as of May 8, 2003 the Purchase Agreement under which Conexant acquired
specified assets of the company relating to a component of the company HSP modem
operations and consisting of inventory, fixed assets from the company offices in
Taiwan, contracts with customers and distributors related to the soft modem
products, and limited intellectual property. The company did not transfer any of
its patent portfolio in connection with this transaction, and the company
retained all operating contracts and intellectual property assets associated
with its hardware modem and wireless products.
In exchange for the assets acquired from PCTEL, Conexant paid approximately
$1075 million in cash to the company, which represents $825 million plus the
book value of the acquired inventory and fixed assets being transferred to
Conexant. Conexant assumed certain liabilities of the company. The total
proceeds of $1075 million netted a gain on sale of assets of $45 million. In
connection with the Purchase Agreement, Conexant agreed to license the company
Segue Wi-Fi software for use with certain of its products. Conexant will pay the
company an aggregate of $1 million, as consideration for this license.
Concurrent with the completion of the transaction with Conexant, the
company and Conexant also completed an Intellectual Property Assignment
Agreement and Cross-License Agreement IPA. The company provided Conexant
with a non-exclusive, worldwide license to certain of the company soft modem
patents. In addition, Conexant assigned 46 U.S. patents and patent applications
relating to modem and other access technologies to the company as part of the
transaction. In consideration for the rights obtained by Conexant from the
company under this agreement, and taking into account the value of rights
obtained by the company from Conexant under this agreement, during the period
beginning on July 1, 2003 and ending on September 30, 2007, Conexant agreed to
pay to the company, on a quarterly basis, royalties in the amount of ten percent
10% of the revenue received during the royalty period, up to a maximum amount
of $05 million per quarter with respect to each calendar quarter during the
royalty period, contingent upon sales by Conexant during the period. Any such
future payments by Conexant to the company in connection with the IPA will be
recorded as part of the gain on sale of assets and related royalties in the
statement of operations. The company amended the cross license agreement with
Conexant in August 2005. The period for which the royalties are payable was
extended to end on June 30, 2009. The quarterly royalty maximum was amended to
be $250,000 per quarter from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2007 and
$200,000 per quarter from January 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009.

2004 Restructuring
In October 2004, the company discontinued its Soft AP product line. The
amount charged to restructuring for severance costs in California and Taiwan as
well as costs associated with the closure of the Taiwan branch office was $01
million. The 2004 restructuring costs were paid in full by the end of fiscal
2005.
2003 Restructuring
In May 2003, the company completed the sale of certain of its assets to
Conexant relating to a component of PCTEL HSP modem product line. As a result
of the disposition, 29 employees were transferred to Conexant. An additional 26
employees, both foreign and domestic, were terminated along with the related
facilities closures. The total restructuring aggregated $33 million consisting
of severance and employment related costs of $18 million and costs related to
closure of excess facilities as a result of the reduction in force of $15
million. As a result of lower than estimated facility shut down costs, the
company reversed $01 million of the restructuring reserve in both 2004 and
2005. The 2003 restructuring costs were paid in full by the end of fiscal 2005.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The net deferred tax

Net deferred tax  $  805 $  417
At December 31, 2005, the company had a full valuation allowance against
the deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of
such assets. On a periodic basis, management evaluates the recoverability of
deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance. At such time as it
is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are
realizable, the valuation allowance will be reduced.
The 2004 and 2003 effective tax rate and 2004 deferred tax asset and
related valuation allowance disclosures include an adjustment to correct an
error related to the treatment of deferred taxes on restricted stock discovered
in 2005. As a result, the Company increased the deferred tax asset and valuation
allowance as of December 31, 2004 by $654,000. The Company determined that the
impact of this adjustment was immaterial for all current and prior periods.
These adjustments had no impact on the Company results of operations or
financial position for any period.
During the fourth quarter 2005, the company changed its estimate regarding
the character in taxation of certain leasing income received in 2004. As a
result, the company reversed the tax expense it booked in 2004 to reflect the
change in estimate regarding its filing position.
The company believes that approximately $04 million of undistributed
earnings of non-domestic subsidiaries were reinvested indefinitely, and no
federal income tax should be provided under the plan of investment. The American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act was passed into law on October 22, 2004
and introduced a special one-time dividend received deduction under certain
circumstances on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a United States
of America taxpayer. At this time the company does not expect to repatriate the
earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as dividends to take advantage of this tax
credit.
At December 31, 2005, the company had the following net operating losses

NOTE 8. CONTINGENCIES
The company has from time to time in the past received correspondence from
third parties, and may receive communications from additional third parties in
the future, asserting that the products infringe on their intellectual property
rights, that the patents are unenforceable or that the company has
inappropriately licensed the intellectual property to third parties. The company
expects these claims to increase as our intellectual property portfolio becomes
larger. These claims could affect the company relationships with existing
customers and may prevent potential future customers from purchasing the
company products or licensing the technology. Intellectual property claims
against the company, and any resulting lawsuit, may result in incurring
significant expenses and could subject the company to significant liability for
damages and invalidate the company proprietary rights. These lawsuits,
regardless of their success, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to
resolve and could divert management time and attention. In addition, any
claims of this kind, whether they are with or without merit, could cause product
shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing
agreements. In the event that PCTEL does not prevail in litigation, the company
could be prevented from selling the company products or be required to enter
into royalty or licensing agreements on terms, which may not be acceptable to
the company. PCTEL could also be prevented from selling the company products
or be required to pay substantial monetary damages. Should PCTEL cross license
the intellectual property in order to obtain licenses, the company may no longer
be able to offer a unique product. To date, PCTEL has not obtained any licenses
from 3Com and the other companies from whom the company has received
communication.

Fraser as a result of the sale of certain stock by Fraser during a secondary
offering in April, 2000. At a mandatory settlement conference held in September
2004, Fraser stipulated to judgment in favor of the company. In November 2004
Fraser appealed the judgment entered against him. Fraser filed his opening brief
in October 2005. The appellant reply brief is due in March 2006. While the
company believes that this appeal is without merit and intends to defend the
appeal vigorously, the company cannot predict or determine the outcome or
resolution of this proceeding or the potential range of loss if any.
Litigation with U.S. Robotics
In May 2003, the company filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California a patent infringement lawsuit against U.S. Robotics
Corporation claiming that U.S. Robotics has infringed one of the company
patents. U.S. Robotics counterclaimed asking for a declaratory judgment that the
claims of the patent are invalid and not infringed. In December 2005, the
parties entered into a settlement agreement which was favorable to the company,
and the Court granted the parties' stipulated request that all claims and
counterclaims in the action be dismissed with prejudice. Under the agreement,
U.S. Robotics will take a license to specific PCTEL modem patents. PCTEL
receives a lump-sum royalty payment, a cross-license to U.S. Robotics patents
and patent applications, and royalties in the future that can be satisfied with
cash payments or product purchases.

Litigation with Agere and Lucent
In May 2003, the company filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California a patent infringement lawsuit against Agere Systems and
Lucent Technologies claiming that Agere has infringed four of the company
patents and that Lucent has infringed three of the company patents. Agere
counterclaimed asking for a declaratory judgment that the claims of the four
patents are invalid, unenforceable and not infringed by Agere.
Because of a then-pending reexamination proceeding for PCTEL U.S. Patent
No. 5,787,305 the '305 patent, the claims against Agere and Lucent relating to
the '305 patent were stayed by stipulation of the parties. Claims construction
discovery under the Patent Local Rules was taken with respect to the three
patents as to which the litigation was not stayed, and the claims construction
issues relating to those patents have been briefed to the Court. A hearing on
the construction of the claims of those patents was held in May 2005, and the
court issued its claim construction ruling in September 2005.
The stay regarding the '305 patent was lifted by stipulation of the parties
after the company received the Reexamination Certified from the U.S. Patent
Office. Claims construction discovery was taken with respect to the '305 patent.
A hearing on the construction of the claims of the '305 patent was held in
January 2006 and the court has taken the matter under submission. No trial date
has been set. Although the company believes that it has meritorious claims and
defenses, the company cannot predict or determine the outcome or resolution of
this proceeding or the potential range of loss if any.

1998 Director Option Plan Directors Plan
The Directors Plan became effective following the company IPO in October
1999. In June 2003 the shareholders approved amendments to the plan, which added
200,000 shares for a plan total of 400,000 shares and increased the annual
options granted to the Board of Directors from 7,500 to 10,000 shares.
Therefore, the company reserved a total of 400,000 shares of common stock that
the company can issue under the company Directors Plan. Under our 1998
Directors Plan, any new non-employee director elected to the Board of Directors
automatically receives a grant of 15,000 shares of common stock. The 15,000
share options will vest one-third as of each anniversary of its date of grant
until the option is fully vested, provided that the optionee continues to serve
as a director on such dates. After the initial 15,000 share options are granted
to the non-employee director, he or she shall automatically be granted an option
to purchase 10,000 shares each year on

Acceleration of Underwater Options
On January 28, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
approved the acceleration of vesting of all unvested options to purchase shares
of common stock of PCTEL that are held by current employees, including executive
officers, and which have an exercise price per share equal to or greater than
$1000. Options to purchase 1,606,805 shares of common stock were accelerated
under this approval. The company accelerated these options in order to mitigate
the associated future share-based compensation expense under SFAS 123R. The
acceleration of these options will result in PCTEL not being required to
recognize share-based compensation expense of approximately $38 million
beginning in the company quarter ending March 31, 2006 and through the
company quarter ending March 31, 2008. The pro-forma net loss and pro-forma
net loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2005 in footnote 1 includes
the $38 million impact of the acceleration of the underwater options. There was
no income statement impact related to the acceleration of options for the year
ended December 31, 2005.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan Purchase Plan
In May 1998, the company reserved a total of 800,000 shares of common stock
for future issuance under the company Purchase Plan, plus annual increases
equal to the lesser of i 350,000 shares ii 2% of the outstanding shares on
such date or iii a lesser amount determined by the Board of Directors. The
Purchase Plan will enable eligible employees to purchase common stock at the
lower of 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or last
day of each offering period. Each offering period is six months. The Purchase
Plan will terminate in 2008. During 2005, 69,636 shares were issued under the
Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2005, the company had 1,781,287 shares
remaining that can be issued under the Purchase Plan.
Deferred Stock Compensation
The company grants restricted shares as employee incentives as permitted
under the company 1997 Stock Plan. In connection with the grant of restricted
stock to employees, the company records deferred stock compensation representing
the fair value of the common stock on the date the restricted stock is granted.
Such amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders' equity and is amortized
ratably over the vesting period of the applicable shares. For the year ended
December 31, 2005, the company issued restricted stock for $56 million and
recorded terminations of $07 million. The number of restricted shares issued
was 720,436 in 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the company issued
restricted stock for $34 million, recorded terminations of $01 million. The
number of shares issued in 2004 was 292,778. The number of shares issued
increased from prior years due to the decision by the company to emphasize the
use of restricted shares as equity incentives in 2005.

In 2003 the company operated as a single segment. In January 2004 PCTEL
began operating in five distinct segments. They are Mobility Solutions
previously software, RF Solutions previously test, Antenna Product
previously antenna, Modems and the Licensing segment. In May 2003, the company
sold its modem product line to Conexant. Intercompany sales and profits from
Antenna Products to RF Solutions are eliminated.
APG core and Sigma are separate operating segments. However, given their
similar long-term economic characteristics, services provided, processes, types
of customers, methods of delivery, regulatory requirements, and meeting certain
quantitative thresholds, the company has concluded these operating segments
should be combined into a ingle reporting segment -- APG

401k Plan
The 401k plan covers all of the employees beginning the first of the
month following the month of their employment. Under this plan, employees may
elect to contribute up to 15% of their current compensation to the 401k plan
up to the statutorily prescribed annual limit. The company may make
discretionary contributions to the 401k. The company made $05 million in
employer contributions to the 401k plan for each of the years ended December
31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.
Post-retirement health insurance
Effective July 2003, the company started a plan to cover post-retirement
health insurance for Martin H. Singer, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer. Based on an actuarial valuation prepared by RSM McGladrey in accordance
with FAS 106, the company accumulated post retirement benefit obligation for
this plan was $141,000 at December 31, 2005. See subsequent footnote 17 related
to the amended employment agreement with Martin H. Singer.
Personal Retirement Savings Account
The Personal Retirement Savings Account PRSA covers all current Sigma
employees. Under this plan, there is no limit for employees contributions of
their current compensation to the PRSA plan. The company may make discretionary
contributions to this plan. The company made contributions of $7,000 for the six
months ended December 31, 2005.
Pension Plan
Certain Sigma employees participate in a defined benefit pension scheme.
Prior to the acquisition in July 2005 and through December 2005, these employees
participated in the Sigma Communications Group Retirement and Death Benefit Plan
old plan. Effective December 2003, this plan was frozen to new

employees. In January 2006, the Sigma participants from the old plan were
transferred to a new retirement and death benefit plan PCTEL Europe Pension
Plan or new plan. The PCTEL Europe Pension Plan has attributes identical to
the old plan. All employees retained their service period under the old plan. At
December 31, 2005, there were 56 participants in the new plan. The assets will
be transferred to the new plan during the quarter ending March 2006. The assets
will be invested in the Pension Consensus Fund managed by Irish Life Investment
Managers Limited. The amounts included as transfers in the information below are
estimates based on actuarial assumptions. Once the assets are transferred, the
trustees of the new plan will approve the asset allocations and other financial
assumptions. The current financial assumptions are based on the old plan.
The discount rate is the rate of interest used to discount benefit
obligations and has been determined by reference to market yields at the balance
sheet date on high quality corporate bonds. The currency and term of the
corporate bonds is consistent with the currency and estimated term of the
post-employment benefit obligations. At the measurement date of December 31,
2005 the iBoxx index of euro-denominated AA-rated corporate bonds yielded 401%
per annum, with individual stocks yielding higher amounts. Taking into account
the profile and duration of the plan liabilities, a discount rate of 425% has
been adopted. The investment strategy pursued by the Pension Consensus Fund is
to broadly maintain a diversified portfolio of 60%-90% in real assets such as
equities and property, with the balance in monetary assets such as fixed
interest and cash. The expected return on plan assets of 65% was based on the
current asset allocation and the long-term expected returns for each asset
class.
The plan liabilities under FAS 87 are highly dependent on the yield on
corporate bonds. The assets are invested primarily in equities. The mismatch
between the notional assets needed to back the liabilities and the assets
actually held is likely to result in a significant degree of volatility of the
funded status from year to year.
For the six months ended December 31, 2005, the company recognized
consolidated pension expense of $129,000 and contributed approximately $62,000
to the new plan. The company funding policy is to contribute cash to the
pension plan in order to at least meet the minimum contribution requirements.
The company will be required to make payments for the under funded amount. Once
the new plan is set up, the company will determine the timing of the payments
for the under funded balance. The estimated payments to the new plan in 2006 are
approximately $05 million.
At December 31, 2005, the defined benefit obligation was $58 million, the
fair value of the plan assets was $26 million, and the company net pension
liability was $31 million. From the acquisition date, the pension liability
increased $62,000.

and restated employment agreement which eliminated the post-retirement
healthcare benefits for Mr. Singer and his family that were previously included
in his original employment agreement. Mr. Singer requested the elimination of
these benefits for reasons related to future corporate expense, the company
commitment to defined contribution plans rather than defined benefit plans, and
parity of benefits with other executives of the company. The company will
reverse the liability of $141,000 in the quarter ending March 31, 2006.

Item 4A: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
a EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Under the supervision and with the participation of PCTEL management,
including the company Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief
Financial Officer, our management evaluated the effectiveness of the company
disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15e
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of
December 31, 2005. Based on that evaluation, the Company Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer concluded that the company
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable level of
assurance as of December 31, 2005 because of the material weakness discussed
below.
b MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management of PCTEL is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f
and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. PCTEL internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that   - pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of PCTEL   - provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America,
and that receipts and expenditures of PCTEL are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of PCTEL; and
- provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of PCTEL assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.
The management of PCTEL has assessed the effectiveness of the Company
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making its
assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the
criteria described in Internal Control -- Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
Management has excluded Sigma Wireless Technologies Sigma from its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2005 because Sigma was acquired by the Company through a
purchase business combination in July 2005. Sigma is a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company that represents 21% of consolidated total assets and 5% of
consolidated revenues, respectively, as of and for the year ended December 31,
2005.
A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control
deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material
misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected.
As of December 31, 2005, the Company did not maintain effective controls
over the review, completeness and accuracy of its provision for income taxes and
the related financial statement presentation and disclosure of income tax
matters. This control deficiency resulted in audit adjustments to the 2005
annual consolidated financial statements with respect to income tax disclosures
and the 2005 second quarter consolidated financial statements with respect to
the provision for income taxes. In addition, this control deficiency could
result in a misstatement of the income tax provision and income tax related
financial statement disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of
the annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or
75 detected. Accordingly, management has concluded that this control deficiency
constitutes a material weakness.
Because of this material weakness, management has concluded that the
Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the COSO.
Management assessment of the effectiveness of the Company internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which appears herein.
c CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
As disclosed in the Company 2004 Annual Report on Form-10K and in its
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each of the first three quarters of 2005, the
Company previously reported a material weakness in internal control over the
accounting for income taxes, including the determination of income taxes
payable, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the related income tax
provision. Specifically, the Company did not have effective controls over
determining net operating loss carry backs, applicable state tax rates applied,
and the tax effect of stock option exercises. In addition, the Company did not
have effective controls to monitor the difference between the income tax basis
and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and reconcile the
difference to deferred income tax assets and liabilities.
During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company made significant
progress in executing the remediation plans that were established to address the
material weakness in its internal control surrounding the accounting for income
taxes. This resulted in certain improvements in the Company internal control
over financial reporting. With the help of external advisors other than the
company independent registered public accounting firm, the following remedial
actions have been undertaken   - Engaged an outside tax consultant to prepare the tax provision, provide
tax expertise and expertise in the application of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes.
- Implemented an internal training program to enhance the capabilities of
its internal tax personnel.
- Acquired software to automate and better control the tax provision
preparation process.
- Improved its system of internal controls over the review of the
consolidated income tax provision.
Specifically, the Company changes in controls over income taxes were
successful in the remediation of the deficiencies related to the determination
of income tax payable and deferred income tax assets and liabilities.
As demonstrated by the above, the Company has made significant progress in
its efforts to remediate this material weakness during 2005. This is further
supported by the Company overall positive results from its 2005 internal
control compliance testing required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, which was carried out by the Company in the third and fourth quarters of
2005. In making its determination as to the status of the remediation of this
material weakness, the Company has considered all of the factors outlined above
and has concluded that the internal controls surrounding the accounting for
income taxes are effectively designed, however, as a result of the audit
adjustments, the Company has not demonstrated operating effectiveness with
respect to controls over the completeness and accuracy of its income tax
provision and the presentation and disclosures related to income taxes.
Accordingly, as discussed in Management Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting above, the Company reported this as a material weakness as
of December 31, 2005.
In order to remediate this deficiency in internal controls, the Company
will continue its training and education efforts in this area so that operating
effectiveness can be demonstrated over a period of time that is sufficient to
support the conclusion that the material weakness has been remediated. In
addition, to further enhance the controls surrounding the accounting for income
taxes, the Company will continue its efforts with
76 respect to 1 its oversight over the quarterly and annual preparation of its tax
provision and related disclosures by its outside tax consultant, and 2 the need
to consider additional resources to help execute its internal controls over the
accounting for income taxes.
Except as otherwise discussed above, there have been no changes in the
Company internal control over financial reporting during the most recently
completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company internal control over financial reporting.
