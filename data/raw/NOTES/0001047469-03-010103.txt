Report of Independent Accountants   
To
the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of IntradoInc. 
In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of IntradoInc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2002 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended December31,
2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based upon our audit. We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. The financial statements of the Company as of December31, 2001 and for each of
the twoyears in the period ended December31, 2001 were audited by other independent accountants who have ceased operations. Those independent accountants expressed an unqualified
opinion on those financial statements in their report dated January25, 2002. 
As
discussed in Note3 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January1, 2002 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. 
As
discussed above, the consolidated financial statements of IntradoInc. as of December31, 2001, and for each of the twoyears in the period ended
December31, 2001, were audited by other independent accountants who have ceased operations. As described in Note3, these financial statements have been revised to include the
transitional disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which was adopted by the Company as of January1, 2002.
We audited the transitional disclosures described in Note3. In our opinion, the transitional disclosures for 2001 and 2000 in Note3 are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to
audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 or 2000 financial statements of the Company other than
with respect to such disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 or 2000 financial statements taken as a whole.

Predecessor Auditor Arthur Andersen LLP Opinion 
The following report is a copy of a report previously issued by Arthur Andersen LLP and has not been reissued by Arthur Andersen LLP. As
discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies note, in 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets SFAS No142. As discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies note, the corporation has presented the transitional disclosures for 2001 and 2000 required by
SFAS No142. The Arthur Andersen LLP report does not extend to these changes to the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial statements. The adjustments to the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial
statements were reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as stated in their report appearing herein. To
IntradoInc.: 
We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of IntradoInc. a Delaware corporation formerly known as SCC Communications Corp. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2001
and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2001. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of IntradoInc. and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2001, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. 
As
discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies footnote to the financial statements, in 2000 the Company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition. s/

INTRADOINC.      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      DECEMBER 31, 2002    
1 ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS 
IntradoInc., a Delaware corporation the Company, provides emergency-telephony solutions that manage and deliver mission-critical information for
telecommunications providers including incumbent local exchange carriers ILECs, competitive local exchange carriers CLECs, wireless carriers, state and local governments in the United States
and public safety organizations. The Company manages the data that enables 9-1-1 calls to be routed to the appropriate public safety agency with accurate and timely information
about the caller identification, callback number and location. In addition, the Company licenses its software to carriers that wish to manage the delivery of 9-1-1 data
management services in-house. 
2 ACQUISITION 
On May11, 2001, the Company acquired certain assets, and assumed certain liabilities, associated with the call handling and database divisions of Lucent
Public Safety Systems LPSS, an internal venture of Lucent TechnologiesInc. Lucent. The operating activities associated with the assets and liabilities assumed in this transaction are
included in these financial statements from the date of acquisition forward. The Company accounted for this transaction using the purchase method of accounting. The
Company uses the assets acquired from LPSS to sell 9-1-1 supporting hardware and software technology, including the Palladium[nc_cad,176] call
center and data-management systems. A number of telecommunications companies manage their 9-1-1 infrastructures with these newly acquired hardware
and software systems. In addition, the Company systems are used by public safety call centers across the nation to receive and respond to wireline and wireless E9-1-1 calls.
Revenue from the acquired assets is variable and includes a combination of monthly recurring revenue and one-time sales of systems. As
part of the acquisition, the Company: issued
2,250,000 shares of its common stock to Lucent;
agreed
to pay approximately $48million to Lucent for inventory, secured by a note payable; and
agreed
to issue, 24months from the date of closing, up to $329million of mandatorily redeemable, non-voting, preferred stock
Preferred Stock, subject to the attainment of specific total combined revenue Total Revenue targets. The
obligation to purchase approximately $48million of inventory is payable in four equal installments beginning in August2002 and ending in May2003 and
therefore, was discounted and recorded at $41million as of the date of the acquisition. The discount on this obligation is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest
method. 
In
January2002, Lucent created a new partnership named New Ventures Partners II LP NVPII and transferred its shares of Intrado common stock and its right to receive
Intrado Preferred Stock to NVP II. 
The
actual amount of the Preferred Stock to be issued will be determined over a 24-month contingency period that commenced on June1, 2001. If Total Revenue, as
defined in the purchase agreement, meets or exceeds $258million for that 24-month period, then NVP II is entitled to the full  issuance of $329million in Preferred Stock. If Total Revenue is greater than $179million, but less than $258million, NVP II will be entitled to a pro rata issuance of
Preferred Stock at a rate of $417,000 for each million dollars of Total Revenue in excess of $179million. The
commitment to issue Preferred Stock will not be recorded until the targets are met, if at all, and would be treated as an increase in the purchase price and a corresponding increase
to goodwill. The Preferred Stock would be recorded at its fair value and accreted to its face value over the redemption period. The accretion would be treated as a dividend, reducing the income
available to common stockholders. Over the nineteen-month period beginning on June1, 2001 and ending on December31,
2002, the Company recorded approximately $1630million in total combined revenue. No dividends will be paid on the Preferred Stock. 
The
mandatory redemption of the then issued Preferred Stock, if any, commences 30days from initial issuance with 33% due, followed by an additional 33% due on June1, 2004
and the remaining 34% due on June1, 2005. Early redemption is available at the option of the Company. The Company must redeem shares of Preferred Stock with 25% of the gross proceeds of any
underwritten public offering after June1, 2003. 
Exclusive
of future contingent consideration, the recorded purchase price of the gross assets acquired in this transaction was approximately $301million. The purchase price is
comprised of 2,250,000 shares of common stock valued at $991 per share, issuance of a commitment to purchase inventory from Lucent with a fair value of approximately $41million,
approximately $899,000 of liabilities recognized in connection with the acquisition, acquisition fees of approximately $15million paid to investment bankers and other transaction costs of
approximately $12million. As part of the acquisition the Company acquired, net tangible assets consisting of inventory valued at approximately $41million and property and equipment
valued at approximately $10million. The $250million of purchase price over the estimated fair value of net tangible assets acquired, was allocated to intangible assets as follows 116million to goodwill; $82million to intellectual property; $35million to customer contracts acquired; and $17million to workforce. 
The
Company included $899,000 of costs in the purchase price, all of which are related to estimated transition costs to move new employees out of the Lucent facility and into the
Company facility. The Company recognized $37,000 and $711,000 of these costs related to the move in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The remaining $151,000 was recorded as an adjustment to purchase
price and goodwill during 2002.

Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions. These
estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material inter-company accounts have been
eliminated in consolidation. 
Reclassifications 
Certain prior year amounts have been re-classified to conform to the current year presentation. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
All highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents. All cash equivalents are carried at
cost, which approximates fair value. 
Inventory 
The inventory balance at December31, 2002, consists of computer upgrades that will be sold to new or existing customers. This inventory will be moved to
deferred contract costs when shipped to a customer site as part of a total 9-1-1 solution, and will be expensed as a direct cost as the corresponding revenue is recognized. The
Company periodically assesses its inventory to determine market value based upon factors such as replacement costs and recoverable value. 
As
part of the original acquisition of Lucent Public Safety Systems in May2001, the Company acquired a purchase obligation for inventory of $48million. The inventory
consisted of eight high capacity, high-speed UNIX servers and software licenses. The obligation to purchase the inventory requires four equal quarterly installment payments of
$12million beginning in August2002 and ending  in May2003. During 2002, the Company remitted the first and second of the payments due to Lucent. At the time each payment is remitted to Lucent, title for 25% of the inventory will transfer
to the Company. 
In
the second quarter of 2002, management determined that the value of the inventory was impaired. Analysis revealed that there was a significant level of uncertainty regarding the
Company ability to use these assets internally or to sell the assets to its customer base. On April30, 2002, the original equipment manufacturer OEM, announced they were discontinuing
production of this equipment and would no longer provide underlying support and maintenance after December31, 2007. While management made concerted efforts to sell this inventory since the
acquisition date, the end of life announcement by OEM had a material adverse impact on various sales channels the Company was pursuing. When the OEM announcement was made, management had already
begun to evaluate the potential utility this inventory would provide if deployed internally. The analysis of the potential benefits that could be generated by internal deployment of this inventory was
completed in July2002, but contained a significant amount of uncertainty and risk. Other factors considered by management in making the impairment determination were the historically long sale
cycles for this type of equipment and reduced overall capital expenditure forecasts within the Company customer base. Based
on the above factors, and the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the utility and market value of this equipment, the Company determined that the fair market
value was minimal and limited to the value of the software licenses acquired as part of the inventory purchase. As a result, the Company wrote off the entire remaining balance of the inventory. 
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are carried at historical cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over
estimated useful lives of three to five years for computer hardware and equipment, seven years for furniture and fixtures and the lesser of the asset life or the life of the lease for leasehold
improvements. The costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed while expenditures, which extend the useful physical or economic life of property and equipment, are capitalized. Gains and losses on
disposition of property and equipment are recognized in operations in the year of disposition. 
Goodwill and Other Intangibles 
The Company adopted SFAS No141 SFAS141, Business Combinations, on July1, 2001 and SFAS No142 SFAS142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, on January1, 2002. SFAS141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase
accounting method. SFAS142 states that goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its useful life. Rather, goodwill will be subject to an annual assessment, unless events or changes in
circumstances dictate otherwise, for impairment and be written down to its fair value only if the carrying amount is greater than the fair value. In addition, intangible assets will be recognized
separately if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, regardless
of the acquirer intent to do so. The amount and timing of non-cash charges related to intangibles acquired in business combinations have changed significantly from prior practice.  The
Company has recorded on its balance sheet $117million of goodwill, net, as of December31, 2002, which relates entirely to the excess of the purchase price over the
estimated fair value of net identifiable assets acquired in the May2001 LPSS acquisition. As part of the adoption of SFAS142, the Company combined the previously separate workforce
intangible of $13million with goodwill. Of the total goodwill, approximately $102million is associated with the ILEC reporting unit and $15million is associated with the
Direct reporting unit. As a result of the adoption of SFAS142, goodwill was not amortized during the year ended December31, 2002. Prior to 2002, the Company amortized approximately
$600,000 of goodwill on a quarterly basis. 
The
following table presents the impact of SFAS142 on net loss as if the standard had been in effect for the year ended December31, 2001 dollars in thousands, except per
share data: Year ended

Company hired an independent firm to complete both its transitional and annual impairment test, as required under SFAS142, for the year ended December31, 2002. The
income approach was used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit that had been assigned goodwill. That approach involves discounting each reporting unit projected free cash flow at its
weighted average cost of capital to ascertain whether the fair value is higher than the book value, including goodwill. Using this method, the Company determined that the fair value of each reporting
unit with goodwill exceeded its book value. Therefore, in accordance with SFAS142, no further impairment testing was performed. The
Company has recorded $79million net of accumulated amortization of $38million on its balance sheet relating to acquired intangible assets as of
December31, 2002. The acquired intangible assets include intellectual property and contracts acquired as part of the LPSS acquisition. In accordance with SFAS142, the Company
reevaluated the book value and the useful lives and determined that no adjustments were necessary. Accordingly, the Company continues to amortize the amounts originally assigned to intellectual
property and contracts. For the year ended December31,  2002, the Company recorded approximately $23million of amortization expense related to these separately identifiable intangible assets.

The Company capitalizes certain internal and external software acquisition and development costs that benefit future years in accordance with the Accounting
Standards Executive Committee issued Statement of Position 98-1 SOP 98-1, if internal use, or SFAS, No86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be
Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed, if the software is to be sold. 
For
software developed for internal use, the Company expenses the costs of developing computer software until the software has reached the application development stage and capitalizes
all costs incurred from that time until the software has been installed at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins. Determination of when the software has reached the application
development stage is based upon completion of conceptual designs, evaluation of alternative designs and  performance requirements. Costs of major enhancements to internal use software are capitalized while routine maintenance of existing software is charged to expense as incurred. The determination of
when the software is in the application development stage and the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of capitalized computer software development costs requires considerable judgment by
management with respect to certain factors, including, but not limited to estimated economic life and changes in software and hardware technology. The Company also contracts with third parties to help
develop or test internal use software and generally capitalizes these costs. 
For
software developed for external use, the Company expenses the costs of developing computer software until technological feasibility is established and capitalizes all costs incurred
from that time until the software is available for general customer release, at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins. Technological feasibility for the Company computer software
products is based upon the earlier of the achievement of: aa detailed program design free of high-risk development issues; or bcompletion of a working model. Costs of
major enhancements to existing products are capitalized while routine maintenance of existing products is charged to expense as incurred. The establishment of the technological feasibility and the
ongoing assessment of the recoverability of capitalized computer software development costs requires considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors, including, but not
limited to, technological feasibility, anticipated future gross revenue, estimated economic life and changes in software and hardware technology. The Company also contracts with third parties to
develop or test software that will be sold to customers, and generally capitalizes these costs. 
Internal-
and external-use capitalized software costs are amortized on a product-by-product basis over a period of three years. The annual
amortization related to software to be sold is the greater of the
amount computed using athe ratio that current gross revenue for a product compares to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenue for that product or bthe
straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, which is typically three years. Amortization expense related to capitalized software costs totaled
approximately $13million, $358,000 and $290,000 for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 
Revenue and Cost Recognition 
The Company generates revenue from all of its five segments, or business units: ILEC, CLEC, Wireless, Direct and Corporate. The revenue from these business
units is derived from monthly data management services, maintenance, systems and new products and professional services. 
Revenue
is accounted for as either software revenue and related post-contract support or services revenue in accordance with the guidelines provided by Statement of Position
No97-2 Software Revenue Recognition and Staff Accounting Bulletin 101 SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. The Company policy is to recognize revenue
when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met, which generally include the following: persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists;
price
is fixed or determinable;
delivery
has occurred or services have been rendered; and
collectibility
is reasonably assured.  The
monthly data management services include revenue from up-front non-recurring engineering NRE fees and monthly service fees. The Company NRE service
consists primarily of the clean up of the customer 9-1-1 data records, engineering services to enable the customer legacy system to interface with Intrado platform,
thereby establishing network connectivity, public safety boundary mapping, customer training and testing. The charges for these services are nonrefundable if the contract is cancelled after the
services are performed. After the initial NRE service, data management customers often buy enhancements to these services, such as additional software engineering to improve system functionality or
network services to make their network more effective Enhancement
Services. The fees received for NRE services and certain Enhancement Services are deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining contractual term of the arrangement. The Company also
receives a monthly service fee to provide ongoing data management services that are required to keep the records current for all subscribers, to maintain and monitor network components and to support
and maintain the software and systems required to provide the services. The fees received for these monthly services are recognized as revenue in the period in which all of the above criteria have
been met, which is generally the month services are provided. 
Maintenance
contracts are sold to customers that purchase database and call handling systems. These contracts designate a specified amount that is to be paid for the support and
maintenance services. The fees received for maintenance are accrued and recognized as revenue over the contractual term of the arrangement. Systems
and new products revenue represents revenue recognized from the sales of new database and call handling systems as well as customized solutions sold to existing customers.
Software license revenue and related hardware sales are recognized upon execution of a contract and completion of delivery obligations, provided that no uncertainties exist regarding customer
acceptance and that collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. 
Professional
services revenue is generated by providing consulting services and is recognized in the period in which all of the above criteria have been met. The
Company defers the up-front NRE fee, certain enhancement fees and related incremental costs and recognizes them over the life of each contract, as these fees and costs do
not represent the culmination of a separate earnings process and benefit the customer over the life of each contract. The adoption of SAB 101 required the Company to reflect a cumulative effect of
change in accounting principles of approximately $31million as if SAB 101 had been implemented on January1, 2000. 
As
of December31, 2002, the Company has total deferred contract revenue of approximately $226million and deferred contract costs of approximately $59million. Of
the total deferred contract revenue at December31, 2002, the Company anticipates that approximately $103million will be recognized in 2003 in full when all the revenue recognition
criteria noted above have been met. Approximately $20million of this amount is included in accounts receivable as of December31, 2002. As of December31, 2002, the
non-current deferred revenue balance of approximately $123million represents NRE fees and certain enhancements related to monthly data management revenue discussed above. A
portion of the non-recurrent deferred revenues amounts relates to contracts for which the start of the contract period has not yet been established. As a result, the exact periods for
which these amounts will be recognized is not yet known. The amount of deferred revenue; net of deferred costs, relating to these contracts is approximately $515,000. These amounts are expected to be
fully  recognized by December31, 2005. The remaining deferred revenue, net of deferred costs will be recognized as follows in thousands: 2003 7,084 2004 6,611 2005 2,306 2006 159 2007 45 16,205 Direct Costs 
Direct costs include costs related to managing the data, which enables 9-1-1 calls to be routed to the appropriate public safety agency
with accurate and timely information about the caller identification, callback number and location. These direct costs include allocations of facility costs; corporate technical operations support
costs and corporate software engineering and maintenance costs, as well as depreciation expense related to equipment used to manage the data. Research and Development 
Research and development efforts consist of salaries, supplies and other related costs incurred while the Company is developing computer software prior to
reaching technological feasibility. These costs are expensed as incurred. 
Income Taxes 
The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No109 SFAS109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The current provision for
income taxes represents actual or estimated amounts
payable or refundable on tax returns filed each year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to the temporary differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under SFAS109, the effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in enacted tax laws is recognized as an adjustment to the tax provision or benefit in the period of enactment. The overall change in deferred tax assets and
liabilities during the period is equal to the deferred tax expense or benefit for the period and benefit from stock option exercises. The carrying value of deferred tax assets may be reduced by a
valuation allowance if, based upon the judgmental assessment of available evidence, it is deemed more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realizable. 
Concentration of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, are primarily cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
investments in high-grade treasury bonds and commercial paper. The Company maintains its cash balances in the form of bank demand deposits,  money market accounts, treasury bonds and commercial paper with original maturities of less than ninety days. The Company deposits and investments are with financial institutions that management
believes are creditworthy and investments that are high-grade. The Company accounts receivable are from customers that are generally telecommunications service providers; accordingly,
the Company accounts receivable are concentrated in the telecommunications industry. The Company major customers Note15 accounted for 32% and 65% of the Company accounts receivable as
of December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company has no significant financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk of accounting loss, such as foreign exchange contracts,
option contracts or other foreign currency hedging arrangements. 
The
Company allowance for doubtful accounts was $589,000 as of December31, 2002 and the Company recognized $572,000 of additional bad debt expense and $139,000 of
charge-offs in 2002. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, corporate debt securities, accounts receivable and debt obligations. The carrying amounts for cash and
cash equivalents and accounts receivable approximate fair market value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of notes are estimated based on current rates available for
debt with similar maturities and securities, and at December31, 2002 and 2001, approximates the carrying value. 
Stock-Based Compensation Plans 
At December31, 2002, the Company has two stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note7. The Company accounts
for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No25, APB 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. No stock-based
employee compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under these plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No123 SFAS123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation in thousands except per share amounts: 2002

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment, excluding goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. Impairment losses are recorded for the excess, if any, of the carrying value over the fair value of the
long-lived assets. 
Comprehensive Income 
Comprehensive income loss includes all changes in stockholders' equity during a period from non-owner sources. Since inception, comprehensive income
loss has been the same as net income loss. 
Earnings Per Share 
Basic earnings loss per share is determined by dividing net income loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during each period. Diluted income loss per share includes the effects of potentially issuable common stock, but only if dilutive i.e., a loss per share is never reduced. The treasury
stock method, using the average price of the Company common stock for the period, is applied to determine dilution from options and warrants. Potentially dilutive common stock options were included
in the calculations of diluted income per share in 2002; these options totaled 249,769. Potentially dilutive common stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted income per share in 2001
and 2000, because their effect is antidilutive; these options totaled 1,745,279 and 858,984, respectively. The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share was as follows in thousands, except
per share amounts: Year Ended December 31 2002

In April2002, the FASB issued SFAS No145 SFAS145, Rescission of FASB Statements No4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB
Statement No13, and Technical Corrections. SFAS145 rescinds SFAS No4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt, and SFAS No64, Extinguishments of
Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements; SFAS145 also rescinds SFAS No44, Accounting for Leases, to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting
for sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions.
SFAS145 also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions. The provision
of SFAS145 related to the rescission of SFAS 4 shall be applied in fiscal years beginning after May15, 2002; the provisions related to SFAS No13 shall be effective for
transactions occurring after May15, 2002; all other provisions of SFAS145 shall be effective for financial statements issued on or after May15, 2002. Early adoption of
SFAS145 is encouraged. The adoption of SFAS145 has not had, nor does the Company believe it will have, a material impact on its current or prospective financial statements. 
In
June2002, the FASB issued SFAS No146 SFAS146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS146 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and replaces Emerging Issues Task Force EITF No94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs in a Restructuring. The provisions of SFAS146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are
initiated after December31, 2002. The Company believes that SFAS146 may have a prospective effect on its financial statements for costs associated with future exit or disposal
activities it may undertake after December31, 2002. 
In
November2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No45 FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has
issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial
recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December31, 2002, irrespective of the guarantor fiscal
year-end. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December15, 2002. The adoption of FIN 45 has not had, nor
does the Company believe it will have, a material impact on its current or prospective financial statements. 
In
December2002, the FASB issued SFAS No148 SFAS148, Accounting for Stock-based CompensationTransition and Disclosure. SFAS148 permits
three transition methods if a company decides to adopt the fair value based method under SFAS No123 of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS148 also requires
disclosure of comparable information regardless of whether, when or how an entity adopts the fair value based method of accounting and changes certain disclosure requirements for companies that do not
adopt the fair value method under SFAS No123. The adoption of SFAS148 has not had, nor does the Company believe it will have, a material impact on its current or prospective financial
statements.  In
January2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 addresses consolidation by business
enterprises of variable interest entities, which have certain characteristics. FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January31, 2003, and to variable interest
entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June15, 2003, to variable interest entities in which
an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February1, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46 has not had, nor does the Company believe it will have, a material impact on its current
or prospective financial statements.

Warrants 
During the second quarter of 2000, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 100,000 shares of the Company common stock to an investor relations consulting firm
for services to be provided over a one-year period. The fair value of this warrant was determined to be $273,000 and was recognized as general and administrative expense over the
one-year service period on a straight-line basis. The fair  value was calculated using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: risk free interest rate of 60%; contractual life of 2years; no dividend yield; and 78%
volatility. The warrant exercise price was $6031 per share and expired in April2002. 
The
Company issued another warrant during the second quarter of 2000 to purchase 36,590 shares of the Company common stock to a marketing firm. The fair value of this warrant was
determined to be $100,000 and was expensed as marketing costs as services were provided during the three months ended September30, 2000. The fair value was calculated using the Black Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions: risk free interest rate of 60%; contractual life of 2years; no dividend yield; and 78% volatility. The warrant exercise price was $6031
per share and expired in April2002. 
During
May2001 the Company issued a warrant to purchase 31,605 shares of the Company common stock as a finder fee as part of the private placement on May2, 2001. During
2002 and 2001, the Company issued 44,590 and 62,650, respectively, shares of common stock upon exercise of warrants. 
Private Placement 
On May2, 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to sell 632,111 shares of its common stock to an institutional investor in a private offering exempt
from registration under the federal securities laws under Rule506 of RegulationD and Section42 of the Securities Act of 1933. The sale closed on May10, 2001. The
common stock was purchased at a negotiated price per share of $791, reflecting the arithmetic average of the closing price of the Company common stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the twenty
consecutive trading days prior to the offering date. The Company paid a finder fee of $250,000 to the broker and issued a warrant to the broker to purchase 31,605 shares with an exercise price of
$791 per share and an expiration date of May2006. Other than the finder fee, the Company did not pay any other compensation or fees in conjunction with this offering of common stock.
Pursuant to this offering, the Company registered the shares held by the institutional investor and the finder in July2001. 
The
fair value of the warrant was determined to be $168,000 and the Company recorded a value of $165,000, which was calculated using the relative fair value allocation of proceeds
received between the stock and warrant issued. The issuance of the warrant and fees paid were treated as costs associated with raising capital. The fair value was calculated using the Black Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions: risk free interest rate of 50%; contractual life of 5years; no dividend yield; and 94% volatility. 
The
Company used the net offering proceeds of approximately $48million for general corporate purposes during the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001, including: repaying
its obligations as they became due;
financing
capital expenditures, including acceleration of the Company wireless deployments and development of the Company coordinate routing database;
and
working
capital.  Stock Option Plan 
As of December31, 2002, the Company has a total of 79,877 shares of common stock available for issuance under the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan 1998 Plan.
Under the terms of the 1998 Plan, the shares reserved for issuance automatically increase on the first trading day of each calendar year by 3% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on
the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar year. The share reserve was increased by 463,406, 451,765 and 344,641 shares under this provision in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
1998 Plan allows for issuances of options to employees, officers, non-employee board members and consultants. 
SFAS123
defines a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options or similar equity instruments. However, SFAS123 allows the continued measurement of
compensation cost for such plans using the intrinsic value based method prescribed by APB 25, provided that pro forma disclosures are made of net income or loss assuming the fair value based method of
SFAS123 had been applied. The Company has elected and continues to account for its stock-based compensation plans under APB 25. Accordingly, for purposes of the pro forma disclosures presented
in Note3, the Company has computed
the fair values of all options granted under the 1998 Plan during 2002, 2001 and 2000, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions: 2002
2001
2000 Risk-free interest rate
600 459 607 Expected dividend yield
000 000 000 Estimated life
42 years
42 years
42 years Volatility
8199 8921 107900 To
estimate lives of options for this valuation, it was assumed options would be exercised upon becoming fully vested and all options will eventually become fully vested. Cumulative
compensation costs recognized in pro forma net income or loss with respect to options that are forfeited prior to vesting is adjusted as a reduction of pro forma compensation expense in the period of
forfeiture. The expected volatility refers to the volatility of the Company common stock over the expected life of a given option. In 2002 and 2001, the Company used the actual volatility of its
common stock over a one-year period to estimate the volatility of options issued. The
total fair value of options granted under the 1998 Option Plan was computed to be approximately $67million, $117million and $68million for the years ended
December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These amounts are amortized ratably over the vesting periods of the options or recognized at date of grant if no vesting period is required. Pro
forma stock-based compensation, net of the effect of forfeitures, was $49million, $33million and $13million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  The

On March18, 1998, the Company adopted an employee stock purchase plan ESPP under which eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of their salaries
through payroll deductions to purchase shares of the Company common stock. The offering periods are successive six-month periods starting January1 and July1 of each year.
At the end of each offering period, amounts contributed by  employees will be used to purchase shares of the Company common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the closing price of the common stock on the first day or last day of the offering
period. The Company board of directors has authorized the issuance of up to 200,000 shares under the ESPP and may terminate the ESPP at any time. At March1 of each year, the shares available
under the ESPP will be restored to 200,000, although the Company board of directors may elect to restore a lesser number of shares. The Company issued 84,275, 84,953 and 54,386 shares under the ESPP
in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In addition, the Company issued 8,227 shares of common stock to board members for services rendered during the year ended December31, 2002. 8 CAPITALIZED LEASE OBLIGATIONS 
The Company had capitalized lease obligations for equipment due on various dates through 2005 of $5,820,000 and $7,441,000 as of December31, 2002 and
2001, respectively. There is approximately $321,000 of imputed interest on these leases at December31, 2002 and the interest rates range from 491% to 95% per annum. These lease obligations
are collateralized by the related assets with a net book value of $8,217,000 and $5,505,000 as of December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 
Maturities
of capital lease obligations as of December31, 2002, are as follows in thousands: 2003 3,495 2004 2,322 2005 370 Thereafter Total minimum lease payments 6,187 LessAmount related to interest 367 Principal portion of future obligations 5,820 LessCurrent portion 3,131 2,689 9 LINE OF CREDIT AND NOTE PAYABLE 
As of December31, 2002, the Company owed $8million on a revolving line of credit arrangement and an additional amount of $750,000 was utilized to
satisfy letter of credit obligations. Borrowing availability under the line of credit, is not to exceed $20million and is further limited to 85% of the Company eligible accounts receivable,
as defined in the line of credit agreement. The interest rate on amounts borrowed under the line of credit is equal to the prime rate plus 15% per annum 575% as of December31, 2002. The
line of credit matures on July31, 2004, requires a $20million minimum balance and is collateralized by accounts receivable. 
During
2002, the Company secured a term loan for $30million from GE Capital, payable in monthly installments through September1, 2005. The interest rate on this term
loan is equal to the prime rate plus 15% per annum. The proceeds of this loan were used to purchase certain hardware and software related to the PDE Wireless product offering.  Maturities
of the term loan as of December31, 2002, are as follows in thousands: 2003 917 2004 1,000 2005 833 Thereafter Principal portion of future obligations 2,750 LessCurrent portion 917 1,833 The
terms of the revolving line of credit, term loan and capital lease obligations require the Company to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants, including current asset
ratios and total indebtedness ratios. As of December31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with all operating and financial debt covenants. 
10 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  Operating Leases 
The Company leases its office and research facilities and certain equipment under operating lease agreements which expire through December2009. Some lease
terms contain escalation clauses and the total amount of rent is expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Rent expense for the years ended December31, 2002,
2001 and 2000 was approximately $44million, $32million and $16million, respectively. Future minimum lease obligations under these agreements are as follows in thousands: 2003 4,090 2004 4,071 2005 4,089 2006 3,922 2007 4,319 Thereafter 13,995 34,486 Litigation 
The Company is subject to various claims and business disputes in the ordinary course of business, none of which are considered to be material to the operations
of the Company except for the following. 
The
Company provides wireline and wireless E9-1-1 database management and related network services for the State of Texas pursuant to a service agreement
Agreement that the Company entered in November1998. On February4, 2003, the Company filed suit in the District Court of Travis County, Texas, 250th District, against the Texas
Commission on State Emergency Communications  CSEC and numerous other defendants for failure to pay amounts due and payable to Intrado for certain wireless services rendered pursuant to the Agreement. As of December31, 2002, the
amount due and payable was approximately $500,000. The defendants allege that they are immune from suit under principles of sovereign immunity. The Company is confident that it will eventually prevail
on the merits and collect amounts due and payable. 
The
Agreement is scheduled to expire in July2004, subject to renewal by the State of Texas for up to five more years. In correspondence that could become relevant to the lawsuit,
CSEC has alleged that the Company has breached the Agreement by improperly billing the defendants for wireless services and that the Agreement should be terminated. The Company believes that all of
CSEC allegations are baseless and have elected not to terminate the Agreement. Instead, the Company is insisting upon full performance under the Agreement by all parties, including the State of
Texas' obligation to pay for services rendered. In contradiction of CSEC position, the Company has received correspondence from
the defendants' legal counsel indicating that the defendants will continue to pay for services as they are rendered, except for certain wireless services that are at issue in the lawsuit. 
The
Company has agreements whereby it indemnifies officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving in such capacity at the
Company request. The term of the indemnification period is for the officer or director lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these
indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the Company has a director and officer insurance policy that limits exposure and the Company believes that this policy would enable it to recover a
portion, if not all, of any future indemnification payments. As a result of its insurance policy coverage, the Company believes that its estimated exposure on these indemnification agreements is
minimal. 
The
Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to
reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with any patent, or any copyright or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third
party, including customers, with respect to the Company products. The term is any time after execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required
to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. The Company has never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, the
Company believes that its estimated exposure on these agreements is minimal. 11 INCOME TAXES 
For income tax return reporting purposes, the Company has approximately $68million of net operating loss carryforwards and approximately
$26million of tax credit carryforwards available to offset future federal taxable income or federal tax liabilities in the United States. The Company is currently pursuing a change in tax
treatment for capitalized software which could increase its net operating loss carryforward to $20million. The effect of this proposed change has not been reflected in the Company financial
statements as of December31, 2002. These carryforwards expire at various dates through 2022.  Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities at December31, 2002 and 2001, were as follows in thousands: December 31 2002
2001 Deferred tax assets Accrued liabilities and other 1,482 1,165 Amortization of goodwill and intangibles 959 699 Equipment impairment 1,401 Net operating loss carryforwards 2,609 7,390 Tax credit carryforwards 2,620 851 Deferred revenue 5,770 2,450 Deferred rent expense 545 518 Total deferred tax assets 15,386 13,073 Deferred tax liabilities Depreciation differences 2,379 1,601 Total deferred tax assets 2,379 1,601 LessValuation allowance 7,396 Net deferred tax asset 13,007 4,076 During
the year ended December31, 2002, the Company reversed valuation allowances previously recorded for net operating loss carryforwards and for temporary differences between
book and tax based upon the Company estimate that it would be more likely than not that it would realize the benefits for these assets in the future. 
During
the year ended December31, 2001, the Company did not record an income tax benefit for any currently generated net operating loss carryforwards or net increases in deferred
tax assets because the Company believed the criteria for recognition was not met. This was affected by increasing the valuation allowance to completely offset the increase in the Company net
deferred tax assets. 
The
components of the benefit for income taxes attributable to income from operations as of December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, were as follows in thousands: December 31 2002
2001
2000 Current provision Deferred benefit, federal and state 6,006 Income tax benefit 6,006 
A
reconciliation of income tax benefit computed by applying the federal income tax rate of 35% and 34% to income loss from continuing operations before income taxes as of
December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, is as follows in thousands: December 31 2002
2001
2000 Computed normal tax benefit expense 1,770 1,981 3,230 Tax effect of permanent differences and other 187 144 83 State tax, net of federal tax impact 164 175 285 Tax credit 357 51 Change in valuation allowance attributable to continuing operations 7,396 2,063 3,598 Income tax benefit 6,006 The
Company received a tax deduction for compensation in excess of compensation expense recognized for financial purposes. Such benefit arises from an increase in the market price of the
stock under employee option agreements between the measurement date as defined in APB No25 and the date at which the compensation deduction for income tax purposes is determinable. Due to
the valuation allowance against the Company net deferred tax asset, additional paid-in capital was not increased for 2001 or 2000. 12 REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 
The management approach to segment identification designates the internal organization that is used by management for making operational decisions and assessing
performance as the source of the Company reportable segments. Based on this approach, the Company has five reportable segments, or business units: ILEC, CLEC, Wireless, Direct, and Corporate.
Substantially all of the Company customers are in the United States. The Company business units are segmented based on the type of customer each business unit serves. The ILEC, CLEC and Wireless
Business Units address ILEC,
CLEC and wireless carriers, respectively. The Direct Business Unit addresses sales, either directly or indirectly, to state and local government entities, including IntelliCastSM, the
State of Texas and the call handling business acquired from Lucent. The Corporate Business Unit captures costs that are not directly related to a specific business unit, including activity for the
NRLLDB. These segments are managed separately because the nature of and the resources used for each segment are unique. 
Revenue
and costs are segregated in the Statement of Operations for the reportable segments. The Company does not segregate assets and liabilities between the segments, as it is
impractical to do so.  For

The Company has a 401k plan under which eligible employees may defer up to 15% of their compensation subject to a maximum annual amount of $10,500. The Company
may make matching contributions and discretionary contributions if approved by the board of directors. The Company matches 50% of employee contributions up to 6% of the employee salary to the extent

are not directly invested in Company stock. 
14 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  Lucent and NV Partners II L.P. 
As discussed in Note2, in May2001, the Company acquired certain assets, and assumed certain liabilities, associated with the call handling and
database divisions of LPSS, an internal venture of Lucent TechnologiesInc. Lucent. 
The
Company also provides maintenance services to Lucent customers on database and call handling contracts on a subcontracted basis. Because these contracts were not assigned directly to
the Company under the asset purchase agreement, the Company bills Lucent for services rendered and Lucent, in turn, bills the customer. In effect, Lucent serves as a pass-through entity
for billing purposes. During 2002 and 2001, the Company recognized approximately $112million and $62million, respectively, in revenue under the sub-contracted services
agreement with Lucent. As of December31, 2002 and 2001, Lucent owes the Company approximately $13million and $416,000, respectively. The payable to Lucent of approximately
$24million and $44million at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, represents the obligation incurred to pay for the inventory acquired in the LPSS, including interest. 
The
obligation to purchase inventory from Lucent is payable in four equal installments beginning in August2002 and ending in May2003. The inventory was written off during
the three months ended June30, 2002 after management determined that the asset value was impaired. However, the cash obligation to pay Lucent going forward remains. During 2002, the Company
remitted the first and second of four $12million payments to Lucent. 
The
Company issued 2,250,000 shares of common stock in connection with its May2001 acquisition of LPSS. As of September30, 2002, 1,792,079 of these shares continue to be
held by NVPartners II L.P NVP II, formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of Lucent, and 457,921 shares are held by Lucent. Ameritech 
The Company provides data management and consulting services pursuant to a service agreement dated August31, 1994 with Ameritech Information Systems.
Under a master lease agreement dated March11, 1996, the Company leases personal property from Ameritech Credit Corporation. Ameritech Information Systems, Ameritech Credit Corporation and
Ameritech Mobile Communications are affiliates of Ameritech Development Corp., which beneficially owned approximately 16million shares  of the Company common stock until June2000. A member of the Company board of directors was a representative of Ameritech Development Corp. at the time the service and master lease
agreements were executed. 
During
the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company recognized approximately $110million, $99million and $98million in revenue,
respectively, from the SBC formerly Ameritech service agreement. As of December31, 2002 and 2001, SBC owed the Company approximately $19million and $22million,
respectively, for services provided. During the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company paid SBC approximately $22million, $16million and
$21million, respectively, pursuant to lease schedules to the master lease agreement. As of December31, 2002 and 2001, the Company owed approximately $40million and
$18million, respectively, pursuant to lease schedules to the master lease agreement. The leases have interest rates ranging from 627% to 950%, require monthly payments and have expiration
dates varying through October2005. 
TechnoCom Corporation 
During the year ended December31, 2002, the Company purchased 294,118 shares of TechnoCom Corporation SeriesA Preferred Stock for $500,000,
representing 29% of the aggregate dilutive voting power of TechnoCom as of September30, 2002. The Company does not exercise any control or influence over TechnoCom and does not have any board
representation. As a result, the Company has accounted for its investment on a cost rather than equity basis. TechnoCom is under contract to provide
development and implementation services to the Wireless business unit in connection with the Company recently announced PDE Position Determining Equipment service offering. TechnoCom also provides
subcontracted services to the Company ILEC customers. During the year ended December31, 2002, the Company paid TechnoCom $955,000 for their services. During the year ended
December31, 2001, the Company made no payments to TechnoCom. 15 MAJOR CUSTOMERS
