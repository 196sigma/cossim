36 HUB GROUP, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Business: Hub Group, Inc. we, us or our provides intermodal transportation services utilizing primarily third party arrangements with railroads. Drayage can be provided by our subsidiary, Hub Group Trucking, Inc., or a third party company. We also arrange for transportation of freight by truck and perform logistics services. Transportation services are provided through our legacy business and our acquisition, Mode Transportation, LLC. We report two distinct business segments. The first segment is Mode, which includes the Mode business we acquired on April1, 2011. The other segment is Hub, which is all business other than Mode. Hub Group includes both segments. 
Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and all entities in which we have more than a 50% equity ownership or otherwise exercise unilateral control. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents: We consider as cash equivalents all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less. As of December31, 2015 and 2014, our cash and temporary investments were with high quality financial institutions in DDAs Demand Deposit Accounts and Savings Accounts. 
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts: In the normal course of business, we extend credit to customers after a review of each customers credit history. An allowance for uncollectible trade accounts has been established through an analysis of the accounts receivable aging, an assessment of collectability based on historical trends and an evaluation based on current economic conditions. To be more specific, we reserve a portion of every account balance that has aged over one year, a portion of receivables for customers in bankruptcy and certain account balances specifically identified as uncollectible. On an annual basis, we perform a hindsight analysis on Hub and Mode separately to determine each segments experience in collecting account balances over one year old and account balances in bankruptcy. We then use this hindsight analysis to establish our reserves for receivables over one year and in bankruptcy. In establishing a reserve for certain account balances specifically identified as uncollectible, we consider the aging of the customer receivables, the specific details as to why the receivable has not been paid, the customers current and projected financial results, the customers ability to meet and sustain their financial commitments, the positive or negative effects of the current and projected industry outlook and the general economic conditions. The allowance for uncollectible accounts is reported on the balance sheet in net accounts receivable. Our reserve for uncollectible accounts was approximately $52 million and $70 million as of December31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Receivables are written off once collection efforts have been exhausted. Recoveries of receivables previously charged off are recorded when received. 
Property and Equipment: Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method at rates adequate to depreciate the cost of the applicable assets over their expected useful lives: building and improvements, up to 40 years; leasehold improvements, the shorter of useful life or lease term; computer equipment and software, up to 10 years; furniture and equipment, up to 10 years; and transportation equipment up to 15 years. Direct costs related to internally developed software projects are capitalized and amortized over their expected useful life on a straight-line basis not to exceed 10 years. Interest is capitalized on qualifying assets under development for internal use. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred and major improvements are capitalized. The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the accumulated depreciation thereon are removed from the accounts with any gain or loss realized upon sale or disposal charged or credited to operations. We review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In the event that the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset group is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the assets carrying amount over its fair value, less cost to dispose, is recorded. 
Goodwill and Other Intangibles: Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired in connection with our business combinations. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests. 
We test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of this asset might exceed the current fair value. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. We assess qualitative factors such as current company performance and overall economic factors to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. In the quantitative goodwill test, a company compares the carrying value of a reporting unit to its fair value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, a second step is performed, which compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value, to determine the amount of impairment. In 2015 and 2014, we performed the qualitative assessment on both the Hub and Mode reporting units. No impairment charge was recognized based on the results of the goodwill impairment tests. 
37 On January1, 2013, we adopted the FASBs new accounting guidance regarding indefinite-lived intangibles which permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative test discussed above. As a result of our impairment analysis, we recorded an impairment charge of $29 million in 2013, which is included in the Impairment of Trade Name line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for information on this impairment charge. 
We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets when impairment indicators exist. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. 
Concentration of Credit Risk: Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. We place our cash and temporary investments with high quality financial institutions in DDAs Demand Deposit Accounts and Savings Accounts. We primarily serve customers located throughout the United States with no significant concentration in any one region. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in 2015, 2014 or 2013. We review a customers credit history before extending credit. In addition, we routinely assess the financial strength of our customers and, as a consequence, believe that our trade accounts receivable risk is limited. 
Revenue Recognition: Revenue is recognized at the time 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, 2 services have been rendered, 3 the sales price is fixed and determinable and 4 collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue and related transportation costs are recognized based on relative transit time. Further, in most cases, we report our revenue on a gross basis because we are the primary obligor as we are responsible for providing the service desired by the customer. Our customers view us as responsible for fulfillment including the acceptability of the service. Services requirements may include, for example, on-time delivery, handling freight loss and damage claims, setting up appointments for pick-up and delivery and tracing shipments in transit. We have discretion in setting sales prices and as a result, the amount we earn varies. In addition, we have the discretion to select our vendors from multiple suppliers for the services ordered by our customers. Finally, we have credit risk for our receivables. These three factors, discretion in setting prices, discretion in selecting vendors and credit risk, further support reporting revenue on a gross basis for most of our revenue. 
Provision for Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. We believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized based on future taxable income projections with the exception of $01 million related to state tax net operating losses for which a valuation allowance has been established. In the event the probability of realizing the remaining deferred tax assets do not meet the more likely than not threshold in the future, a valuation allowance would be established for the deferred tax assets deemed unrecoverable. 
Tax liabilities are recorded when, in managements judgment, a tax position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition as prescribed by the guidance. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, a tax liability may be recorded depending on managements assessment of how the tax position will ultimately be settled. We recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax liabilities in our provision for income taxes. 
Earnings Per Common Share: Basic earnings per common share are based on the average quarterly weighted average number of ClassA and Class B shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share are adjusted for the assumed exercise of dilutive stock options and for restricted stock which are both computed using the treasury stock method. 
Stock Based Compensation: Share-based compensation includes the restricted stock awards expected to vest based on the grant date fair value. Compensation expense is amortized straight-line over the vesting period including an estimate of forfeitures and is included in salaries and benefits. We present excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of share-based compensation as financing cash in-flows and as operating cash out-flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
New Pronouncements: In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Update No. 2014-09Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606.This Standard provides guidance on how to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.For public organizations, the guidance in the update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.The update provides two transition methods to the new guidance: a retrospective approach and a modified retrospective approach.Early application is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.We plan to adopt this standard January 1, 2018, as required.We are awaiting the Joint Transition Resource Group for Revenue Recognitions TRG guidance on principal versus agent reporting revenue gross versus net to complete our assessment of the effect of this pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements.We are currently evaluating the transition method and effect this update will have on our consolidated financial statements.
38 In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Update No. 2015-17Income Taxes Topic 740.This Standard provides guidance on the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes, amending the accounting for income taxes and requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current on the consolidated balance sheet.For public organizations, the guidance in the update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.Early application is permitted.We are currently evaluating the method of adoption and expect this Standard will have an impact on our consolidated balance sheets as our current deferred tax assets were$84 million as of December 31, 2015.
Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, revenue, the cost of transportation, commission expense and useful lives of equipment. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Reclassifications: Certain prior year immaterial amounts have been reclassified in the segment footnote to conform with the current year presentation. NOTE 2. Capital Structure 
We have authorized common stock comprised of ClassA Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. The rights of holders of ClassA Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are identical, except each share of Class B Common Stock entitles its holder to approximately 80 votes, while each share of ClassA Common Stock entitles its holder to one vote. We have authorized 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock. NOTE 3. Earnings Per Share 
The following is a reconciliation of our earnings per share in thousands, except for per share data: Years Ended, December 31 2015 2014 2013 Net income for basic and diluted earnings per share 70,949 51,558 69,110 Weighted average shares outstanding - basic 35,876 36,590 36,829 Dilutive effect ofstock options and restricted stock 92 142 153 Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted 35,968 36,732 36,982 Earnings per share - basic 198 141 188 Earnings per share - diluted 197 140 187 NOTE 4. Impairment of Software 
In 2014, the Hub segment recorded a full write-off of $119 million related to software development costs as a result of our decision to terminate a long-term technology project. Upon deployment in the third quarter of 2014, it was discovered that the software did not properly integrate with our current systems or meet the criteria for which it was designed. We did not believe the software could be cost effectively salvaged and it has no value on the open market. This charge is included in Impairment of software in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. NOTE 5. Business Segments 
We report two distinct business segments. The first segment is Mode, which includes the Mode LLC business we acquired on April1, 2011. The second segment is Hub, which is all business other than Mode. 
39 Hub offers comprehensive intermodal, truck brokerage and logistics services. Our employees operate the freight through a network of operating centers located in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Each operating center is strategically located in a market with a significant concentration of shipping customers and one or more railheads.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
In accordance with the FASB issued guidance in the Intangibles-Goodwill and Other Topic of the Codification, we completed the required annual impairment tests. We performed a qualitative assessment on both the Hub segment goodwill and the Mode segment goodwill. No impairment charges were recognized based on the results of the annual goodwill assessments and there were no accumulated impairment losses of goodwill at the beginning of the period. 
The following table presents the carrying amount of goodwill in thousands: Hub Group Hub Mode Total Balance at January 1, 2014 233,643 29,389 263,032 Other 219 219 Balance at December 31, 2014 233,424 29,389 262,813 Other 219 219 Balance at December 31, 2015 233,205 29,389 262,594 The changes noted as other in the table above for both 2015 and 2014 refer to the amortization of the income tax benefit of tax goodwill in excess of financial statement goodwill. 
In December 2013, we decided to change our branding strategy for Comtrak Logistics which resulted in us retiring the Comtrak name. We decided to change the name of Comtrak to Hub Group Trucking, Inc. as we believed the name change would allow us to benefit from the valuable Hub Group name with customers, vendors and drivers. In conjunction with the strategy, the Comtrak name was no longer used, resulting in no fair value and a write off of the asset. We recorded an impairment charge of $29 million in 2013, which is included in the Impairment of trade name line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.

Amortization expense, excluding impairment, for each of the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $13 million, $13 million and $14 million, respectively. The remaining weighted average life of all definite lived intangible assets as of December31, 2015 was 449 years and 1325 years for Hub and Mode, respectively. Amortization expense for the next five years is as follows in thousands: Hub Group Hub Mode Total 2016 442 853 1,295 2017 442 853 1,295 2018 395 853 1,248 2019 255 853 1,108 2020 255 853 1,108 NOTE 7.

The following is a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the federal statutory tax rate: Years Ended December 31 2015 2014 2013 U.S. federal statutory rate 350 350 350 State taxes, net of federal benefit 24 29 32 State incentives 05 08 06 State law changes 09 09 01 Nondeductible expenses 04 09 08 Other 01 01 Net effective rate 364 370 386 The following is a summary of our provision for income taxes in thousands: Years Ended December 31 2015 2014 2013 Current Federal 21,363 5,939 22,880 State and local 2,900 445 3,817 Foreign 284 249 205 24,547 6,633 26,902 Deferred Federal 16,538 23,600 15,920 State and local 346 191 627 Foreign 106 115 4 16,086 23,676 16,543 Total provision 40,633 30,309 43,445 43 The following is a summary of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in thousands: December 31 2015 2014 Reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 1,672 2,101 Accrued compensation 11,436 7,161 Other reserves 3,245 2,036 Current deferred tax assets 16,353 11,298 Accrued compensation 7,012 6,829 Other reserves 659 764 Operating loss carryforwards 1,914 1,387 Less valuation allowance 108 108 Non-current deferred tax assets 9,477 8,872 Total deferred tax assets 25,830 20,170 Prepaids 3,448 1,551 Other receivables 4,493 4,931 Current deferred tax liabilities 7,941 6,482 Property and equipment 87,148 67,726 Goodwill 82,511 81,647 Non-current deferred tax liabilities 169,659 149,373 Total deferred tax liabilities 177,600 155,855 We are subject to income taxation in the U.S., numerous state jurisdictions, Mexico and Canada.Because income tax return formats vary among the states, we file both unitary and separate company state income tax returns.Our state tax net operating losses of $19 million expire between December31, 2016 and December31, 2035. Management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized with the exception of $01 million related to state tax net operating losses for which a valuation allowance has been established. 
As of December31, 2015 and December31, 2014, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was consistent at $11 million.Of these amounts, our income tax provision would decrease $07 million for each year, if recognized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in thousands: Balance at January 1, 2014 459 Additions for tax positions taken in prior years 231 Additions for tax positions related to the current year 587 Reductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations 212 Balance at December 31, 2014 1,065 Additions for tax positions taken in prior years 166 Additions for tax positions related to the current year 153 Reductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations 245 Balance at December 31, 2015 1,139 We estimate it is reasonably possible that our reserve could either increase or decrease by $03 million during the next twelve months.
We recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax liabilities in our provision for income taxes.In our 2015 provision for income taxes we recognized approximately two thousand five hundred dollars of net interest income from income tax refunds partially offset by expense from income tax penalties. 
Our most recent IRS examination reviewed our 2011 and 2012 tax years and closed in 2014 with no changes.No material examinations took place in 2015.Although no material examinations are currently in effect, tax years 2012 through 2014 generally remain open to examination by the major tax jurisdictions to which we are subject. 44 NOTE 8. Fair Value Measurement 
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and long term debt materially approximated fair value as of December31, 2015 and 2014 due to their short-term nature. 
We consider as cash equivalents all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less. As of December31, 2015 and 2014, our cash and temporary investments were with high quality financial institutions in DDAs Demand Deposit Accounts and Savings Accounts. 
Restricted investments included $211 million and $219 million as of December31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of mutual funds which are reported at fair value. 
Our assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on valuation techniques which consider prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets and liabilities. These valuation methodsare based on either quoted market prices Level 1 or inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly Level 2. Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable are defined as Level 1, while long term debt is defined as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy in the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the Codification. NOTE 9. Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment consist of the following in thousands: December 31 2015 2014 Land 9,855 9,855 Building and improvements 35,267 35,212 Leasehold improvements 4,419 4,241 Computer equipment and software 77,887 70,719 Furniture and equipment 13,260 12,931 Transportation equipment 405,322 346,055 546,010 479,013 Less:Accumulated depreciation and amortization 171,163 140,686 Property and Equipment, net 374,847 338,327 The increase in transportation equipment to $4053 million in 2015 from $3461 million in 2014 was due primarily to the purchase of tractors and containers. 
Included in the transportation equipment is a capital lease obligation entered into for $264 million in 2011. The balances as of December31, 2015 and 2014, net of accumulated amortization, were $147 million and $174 million, respectively. 
Depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment was $359 million, $283 million and $202 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which includes $26 million of amortization expense associated with a capital lease for each of the years ending 2015, 2014 and 2013. This amortization expense is included in transportation costs. Transportation equipment depreciation is included in transportation costs. NOTE 10. Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements 
In December 2013, we amended our Credit Agreement to reduce the interest rate and commitment fees and extend the term until December 2018. The maximum unsecured borrowing capacity remained at $500 million. The interest rate under the Credit Agreement ranges from LIBOR plus 100% to 175% or Prime to Prime plus 075%. The commitment fees charged on the unused line of credit are between 010% and 025%per annum. The financial covenants require a total leverage ratio of not more than 30 to 10 and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 20 to 10. 
We have standby letters of credit that expire in 2016. As of December31, 2015, our letters of credit were $82 million. 
Our unused and available borrowings under our bank revolving line of credit were $418 million as of December31, 2015 and $439 million as of December31, 2014. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December31, 2015. 
45 We have entered into various Equipment Notes Notes for the purchase of tractors and containers.The Notes are secured by the underlying equipment financed in the agreements.
Our outstanding debt is as follows in thousands Period Ended December 31 December 31 2015 2014 Secured Equipment Notes due in December 2020 with monthly principal and interest payments of $06 million commencing in January 2016; interest is paid monthly at a fixed annual rate between 202% and 203 33,066 Secured Equipment Notes due in September 2020 with monthly principal and interest payments of $02 million commencing in October 2015; interest is paid monthly at a fixed annual rate of 184 12,214 Secured Equipment Notes due in July 2020 with monthly principal and interest payments of $01 million commencing in July 2015; interest is paid monthly at a fixed annual rate of 214 6,395 Secured Equipment Notes due in March 2020 with monthly principal and interest payments of $004 million commencing in April 2015; interest is paid monthly at a fixed annual rate of 214 1,998 Secured Equipment Notes due in January 2020 with monthly principal and interest payments of $02 million commencing in February 2015; interest is paid monthly at a fixed annual rate between 172% and 226 7,533 Secured Equipment Notes due in December 2019 with monthly principal and interest payments of $02 million commencing in January 2015; interest is paid monthly at a fixed annual rate of 224 10,828 13,387 Secured Equipment Notes due in November 2019 with monthly principal and interest payments of $05 million commencing in December 2014; interest is paid monthly at a fixed annual rate of 205 22,514 28,429 Secured Equipment Notes due in September 2019 with monthly principal and interest payments of $04 million commencing in September 2014; interest is paid monthly at a fixed annual rate of 215 18,170 22,772 Secured Equipment Notes due in February 2019 with monthly principal and interest payments of $04 million commencing in January 2014; interest is paid monthly at a fixed annual rate between 187% and 193 15,974 21,016 Secured Equipment Notes due in June 2018 with quarterly principal and interest payments of $05 million commencing in August 2013; interest is paid quarterly at a fixed annual rate between 19% and 20 4,612 6,475 133,304 92,079 Less current portion 32,409 19,619 Total long-term debt 100,895 72,460 Aggregate principal payments, in thousands, due subsequent to December31, 2015, are as follows: 2016 32,409 2017 32,772 2018 32,449 2019 25,766 2020 9,908 133,304 In 2011, we entered into a lease agreement for 3,126 chassis for a period of 10 years. We are accounting for this lease as a capital lease. Interest on this capital lease obligation is based on interest rates that approximate currently available interest rates; therefore, indebtedness under this capital lease obligation approximates fair value. 
We paid interest of $07 million, $08 million and $09 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to this capital lease. 
46 NOTE 11. Leases, User Charges and Commitments 
Minimum annual capital and operating lease payments, as of December31, 2015, under non-cancelable leases, principally for containers, chassis, other equipment and real estate, as well as other commitments are payable as follows in thousands:

Many of the real estate leases contain renewal options and escalation clauses which require payments of additional rent to the extent of increases in the related operating costs. We straight-line rental expense in accordance with the FASB guidance in the Leases Topic of the Codification. 
We incur rental expense for our leased containers, tractors and trailers that are included in transportation costs and totaled $119 million, $131 million, and $102 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
We incur user charges for use of a fleet of rail owned chassis, chassis under capital lease and dedicated rail owned containers on the Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern railroads which are included in transportation costs. Such charges were $743 million, $678 million and $691 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of December31, 2013, we have the ability to return the majority of the containers and pay for the rail owned chassis only when we are using them under these agreements. As a result, no minimum commitments related to these rail owned chassis and containers have been included in the table above.
In addition to the commitments above, in December 2015, we committed to acquire 1,000 53 containers.We expect the total purchase price of these containers to be approximately $9 million.We expect to take delivery of the equipment between February and April 2016.We are still deciding whether we will lease the containers or finance the purchase with secured fixed rate debt. NOTE 12. Guarantees 
As a recruiting tool for our owner-operators, we are guaranteeing certain owner-operators lease payments for tractors. The guarantees expire at various dates through 2020. 
The potential maximum exposure under these lease guarantees was approximately $103 million and $272 million as of December31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The potential maximum exposure represents the amount of the remaining lease payments on all outstanding guaranteed leases as of December31, 2015 and 2014. However, upon default, we have the option to purchase the tractors. We could then sell the tractors and use the proceeds to recover all or a portion of the amounts paid under the guarantees. Alternatively, we can contract with another owner operator who would assume the lease or continue to operate the leased tractor in our company fleet. There were no material defaults during the years ended December31, 2015 and 2014 and no potential material defaults. 
We had a liability of approximately $01 million at December31, 2015 and $03 million as of December31, 2014, representing the fair value for estimated defaults of the guarantees, based on a discounted cash-flow analysis which is included in current and non-current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We are amortizing the amounts over the remaining lives of the respective guarantees. 47 NOTE 13. Stock-Based Compensation Plans 
In 1996, we adopted a Long-Term Incentive Plan the 1996 Incentive Plan. The number of shares of ClassA Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 1996 Incentive Plan was 1,800,000. In 1997, we adopted a second Long-Term Incentive Plan the 1997 Incentive Plan. The number of shares of ClassA Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 1997 Incentive Plan was 600,000. In 1999 we adopted a third Long-Term Incentive Plan the 1999 Incentive Plan. The number of shares of ClassA Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 1999 Incentive Plan was 2,400,000. In 2002, we adopted a fourth Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2002 Incentive Plan. The number of shares of ClassA Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 2002 Incentive Plan was 2,400,000. In 2003, we amended our 2002 Incentive Plan to add an additional 2,000,000 shares of ClassA Common Stock that are reserved for issuance. In 2007, we amended our 2002 Incentive Plan to add an additional 1,000,000 shares of ClassA Common Stock that are reserved for issuance. Under the 2002 Incentive Plan, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units may be granted for the purpose of attracting and motivating our key employees and non-employee directors. We have not granted any stock options since 2003 and have no stock options outstanding. Restricted stock vests over a three to five year period. As of December31, 2015, 526,747 shares were available for future grant. When stock options are exercised, either new shares are issued or shares are issued out of treasury. 
Share-based compensation expense for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $78 million, $83 million and $77 million or $50 million, $52 million and $46 million, net of taxes, respectively. 
Intrinsic value for stock options is defined as the difference between the current market value and the grant price. There were no options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2015 or 2014.The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the year ended December31, 2013 was $06 million. Cash received from stock options exercised during the year ended December31, 2013 was $004 million.

As of December31, 2015, there was $193 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 294 years. 
During January 2016, we granted 339,852 shares of restricted stock to certain employees and 22,000 shares of restricted stock to outside directors with a weighted average grant date fair value of $3295. The stock vests over a three to five year period. NOTE 14. Employee Benefit Plans 
We had one profit-sharing plan and trust as of December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, all under section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code. At our discretion, we partially match qualified contributions made by employees to the plan. We incurred expense of $19 million, $19 million and $18 million related to this plan in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 
In January 2005, we established the Hub Group, Inc. Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan the Plan to provide added incentive for the retention of certain key employees. Under the Plan, participants can elect to defer certain compensation. Accounts will grow on a tax-deferred basis to the participant. Restricted investments included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets represent the fair value of the mutual funds and other security investments related to the Plan as of December31, 2015 and 2014. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in income and expense and offset the change in the deferred compensation liability.

Robles
On January 25, 2013, a complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California Sacramento Division by Salvador Robles against our subsidiary, Comtrak Logistics, Inc., now known as Hub Group Trucking, Inc.Mr. Robles drove a truck for Hub Group Trucking in California, first as an independent contractor and then as an employee.The action was brought on behalf of a class comprised of present and former California-based truck drivers for Hub Group Trucking who were classified as independent contractors, from January 2009 to August 2014.The complaint alleges Hub Group Trucking has misclassified such drivers as independent contractors and that such drivers were employees.The complaint asserts various violations of the California Labor Code and claims that Hub Group Trucking has engaged in unfair competition practices.The complaint seeks, among other things, declaratory and injunctive relief, compensatory damages and attorneys fees.In May 2013, the complaint was amended to add similar claims based on Mr. Robles status as an employed company driver.These additional claims are only on behalf of Mr. Robles and not a putative class.
49 The Company believes that the California independent contractor truck drivers were properly classified as independent contractors at all times.Nevertheless, because lawsuits are expensive, time-consuming and could interrupt our business operations, Hub Group Trucking decided to make settlement offers to individual drivers with respect to the claims alleged in this lawsuit, without admitting liability.As of December 31, 2015, 93% of the California drivers have accepted the settlement offers.In late 2014, Hub Group Trucking decided to convert its model from independent contractors to employee drivers in California.
On April 3, 2015, the Robles case was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee Western Division in Memphis.In May 2015, the plaintiffs in the Robles case filed a Second Amended Complaint SAC which names 334 current and former Hub Group Trucking drivers as interested putative class members.In addition to reasserting their existing claims, the SAC includes claims post-conversion, added two new plaintiffs and seeks a judicial declaration that the settlement agreements are unenforceable.In June 2015, Hub Group Trucking filed a motion to dismiss the SAC.This motion is fully briefed and Hub Group Trucking is awaiting a ruling from the Court.
Adame, Et Al. v Hub Group, Inc., Et Al.
On August 5, 2015, the Plaintiffs law firm in the Robles case filed a lawsuit in state court in San Bernardino County, California on behalf of 63 named Plaintiffs against Hub Group Trucking and five Company employees.The lawsuit alleges claims similar to those being made in Robles and seeks monetary penalties under the Private Attorneys General Act.Of the 63 named Plaintiffs, at least 58 of them previously accepted the settlement offers referenced above. 
On October 29, 2015, Defendants filed a notice of removal to remove the case from state court in San Bernardino to federal court in the Central District of California.On November 19, 2015, Defendants filed a motion to transfer the case to federal court in Memphis, Tennessee and also filed a motion to dismiss the case pursuant to a clause in the independent contractor agreement stating that Tennessee law applies.Also on November 19, 2015, Plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the case back to state court, claiming that the federal court lacks jurisdiction over the case.
Lubinski
On September 12, 2014, a complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division by Christian Lubinski against Hub Group Trucking.The action was brought on behalf of a class comprised of present and former owner-operators providing delivery services in Illinois for Hub Group Trucking.The complaint alleged Hub Group Trucking misclassified such drivers as independent contractors and that such drivers were employees.The complaint alleged that Hub Group Trucking made illegal deductions from the drivers pay and failed to properly compensate the drivers for all hours worked, reimburse business expenses, pay employment taxes, and provide workers compensation and other employment benefits.The complaint asserted various violations of the Illinois Wage Payment and Collections Act and claimed that Hub Group Trucking was unjustly enriched.The complaint sought, among other things, monetary damages for the relevant statutory period and attorneys fees.
On October 24, 2014, the Lubinski case was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee Western Division, in Memphis.On September 22, 2015, the court granted Hub Group Truckings motion to dismiss Lubinskis Illinois law claims with prejudice based on the contractual choice of law provision providing that Tennessee law governed.The court denied as moot Hub Group Truckings motion to dismiss based on federal preemption.On October 2, 2015, Lubinski appealed this order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati.
We cannot reasonably estimate at this time the possible loss or range of loss, if any, that may arise from the remaining unresolved claims in the above mentioned lawsuits.
We are a party to other litigation incident to our business, including claims for personal injury and/or property damage, bankruptcy preference claims, and claims regarding freight lost or damaged in transit, improperly shipped or improperly billed.Some of the lawsuits to which we are party are covered by insurance and are being defended by our insurance carriers.Some of the lawsuits are not covered by insurance and we defend those ourselves.We do not believe that the outcome of this litigation will have a materially adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
As of December31, 2015, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15f and Rule 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
No significant changes were made in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2015 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate controls over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015. Based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework the COSO criteria, management believes our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2015. 
Management believes, however, that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 
Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements, included in this report, has issued an attestation report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. 52 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Hub Group, Inc.: We have audited Hub Group, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework the COSO criteria. Hub Group, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Hub Group, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Hub Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 of Hub Group, Inc. and our report dated February 26, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ Ernst Young LLP
