1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Prior to July 3, 1997, Griffin Land & Nurseries, Inc. Griffin was a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Culbro Corporation Culbro. On July 3, 1997, as
previously approved by Culbro Board of Directors, Culbro distributed the

include the accounts of Griffin real estate division Griffin Land,

discontinued operation in these statements. Prior to March 18, 1997, Griffin was
known as Culbro Land Resources, Inc. The consolidated financial statements have
been presented as if Griffin had operated as an independent stand-alone entity
for all periods presented see Note 2. Such financial statements may not
necessarily present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows
Griffin would have reported had it actually operated as a stand-alone entity.
See Note 3 for consolidated condensed unaudited pro forma financial information.
All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
Griffin accounts for its investments in Centaur Communication, Ltd.
Centaur, Linguaphone Group PLC Linguaphone and real estate joint
ventures under the equity method. Results of real estate joint ventures are
included in operating profit.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Griffin is engaged in the landscape nursery and real estate businesses.
Imperial, Griffin subsidiary in the landscape nursery segment, is engaged in
growing plants which are sold principally to garden centers, wholesalers and
merchandisers, and operating sales and service centers which sell principally to
landscapers. Griffin real estate segment, Griffin Land, builds, leases and
manages commercial and industrial properties and develops residential
subdivisions on real estate in Connecticut and Massachusetts that was previously
owned by Culbro and transferred to Griffin in accordance with the Distribution
Agreement see Note 2.
FISCAL YEAR
Griffin fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest November 30. Fiscal years

Eurodollar deposits. The bank commercial paper and Eurodollar deposits mature
within 90 days of purchase.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is determined on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful asset lives for financial
reporting purposes and principally on accelerated methods for tax purposes.
REVENUE AND GAIN RECOGNITION
In the landscape nursery business, sales and the related cost of sales are
recognized upon shipment of products. Sales returns are not material. In the
real estate business, gains on real estate sales are recognized in accordance
with SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The amounts included in the financial statements for accounts receivable,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities reflect their fair values because of
the short-term maturity of these instruments. The fair values of Griffin other
financial instruments are discussed in Note 8.
PER SHARE RESULTS
Prior to July 3, 1997, Griffin was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Culbro.
Accordingly, per share results are presented on a pro forma basis. For periods
prior to the Distribution of Griffin common stock to Culbro shareholders, pro
forma per share results reflect the weighted average common shares outstanding
equal to Culbro weighted average common shares outstanding because the Griffin
common stock was distributed to Culbro shareholders on a one-for-one basis.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per
Share. SFAS No. 128 requires companies to present basic earnings per share and,
if applicable, diluted earnings per share instead of primary and fully diluted
earnings per share. Basic earnings per share include the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding during the period, and does not include common
stock equivalents. Under SFAS No. 128, diluted earnings per share include the
weighted-average shares outstanding and common stock equivalents. SFAS No. 128
must be adopted by Griffin in fiscal 1998. Early adoption of SFAS No. 128 is not
permitted. See Note 10.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and revenue and expenses during the period reported. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

CULBRO INVESTMENT
Through the Distribution, Griffin maintained an intercompany account with
Culbro in which intercompany transactions, including cash transfers and the
liability for benefit and insurance costs and allocated general and
administrative expenses described below were recorded. The balance in the
intercompany account at the end of 1996 and 1995 was included in Culbro
Investment in the consolidated balance sheet. The Culbro Investment account also
included the cumulative results of Griffin and its capital stock. Concurrent
with the distribution of Griffin common stock to Culbro shareholders on July
3, 1997, the balance in the Culbro Investment account was reclassified to common
stock and additional paid-in capital see Note 10. The changes in the Culbro
Investment account are summarized as follows:

TREASURY

treasury activities were integrated in Culbro cash management system.
Griffin cash receipts were transferred daily into Culbro cash account and
Griffin cash disbursement accounts were reimbursed by Culbro on a daily basis.

disbursement accounts was reflected in Culbro Investment in the consolidated
balance sheet. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, Griffin treasury
activities were separated from Culbro and its other subsidiaries from the date
of the Distribution Agreement through the actual Distribution of Griffin
common stock to Culbro shareholders.
INTERCOMPANY ACTIVITIES
Prior to the Distribution, Griffin employees participated in certain
benefit programs which were sponsored and administered by Culbro. See Note 9 for
discussion of employee benefit plan costs. Griffin risk insurance and employee
medical coverage were provided through insurance policies and programs purchased
by Culbro on behalf of Griffin and Culbro other subsidiaries. The cost of
these items was allocated based on the specific insurance data related to each
subsidiary of Culbro. All direct charges relating to Griffin for these services,
and Griffin participation in these plans, were charged to Griffin by Culbro
and included in Griffin consolidated financial statements through the date of
the Distribution. Prior to the Distribution, a portion of Culbro management time
and resources were related to the operations of Griffin, and Culbro also
performed certain specific administrative functions for Griffin, including
legal, tax, treasury, human resources and internal audit. In addition to the
direct charges for employee benefits and risk insurance described above, the
consolidated statement of operations reflects general and administrative
expenses of $10 million in 1997 through the Distribution and $18 million and
$21 million for fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1995, respectively, allocated by Culbro
to Griffin for these services. These charges were based principally on Griffin
proportionate share of expenses relating to the Culbro corporate activities
associated with Griffin operations and are considered by management to be
reasonable. These amounts may not necessarily be indicative of the actual
general and administrative expenses Griffin would have incurred had it operated
independently prior to the Distribution.
In lieu of Griffin being charged interest on its intercompany balance with
Culbro, all of the interest on Culbro general corporate debt was included in
Griffin consolidated statement of operations through the date of the Liability
Assumption see Notes 2 and 3. All of the general corporate debt of Culbro was
included in Griffin financial statements because management determined that
this debt related to Culbro nontobacco businesses.
LEASES
Griffin, as lessor, and General Cigar Co., Inc. General Cigar, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of GC Holdings, as lessee, have entered into leases for
certain agricultural land in Connecticut and Massachusetts the Agricultural
Lease and for certain commercial office space in Connecticut the Commercial
Lease. The Agricultural Lease is for approximately 500 acres of arable land
held by Griffin for possible development in the long-term, but which will be
used by General Cigar for growing Connecticut Shade wrapper tobacco. General
Cigar use of the land is limited to the cultivation of cigar wrapper tobacco.
The Agricultural Lease has an initial term of ten years and provides for the
extension of the lease for additional periods thereafter. In addition, at
Griffin option, the Agricultural Lease may be terminated with respect to 100
acres of such land annually upon one year prior notice. The rent payable by
General Cigar under the Agricultural Lease is approximately equal to the
aggregate amount of all taxes and other assessments payable by Griffin
attributable to the land leased. The Commercial Lease is for approximately
40,000 square feet of office space in the Griffin Center South office complex in
Bloomfield, Connecticut. The

Commercial Lease has an initial term of ten years and provides for the extension
of the lease for additional periods thereafter. Management believes the rent
payable by General Cigar under the Commercial Lease is at market rates.
SERVICES AGREEMENT
Culbro GC Holdings following the Merger and Griffin entered into a
services agreement the Services Agreement pursuant to which Culbro agreed to
provide a number of administrative and other services to Griffin for a period of
at least one year. These services include administration of certain of Griffin
insurance policies, internal audit, preparation of tax returns, transportation
and general in-house legal services. Griffin will make an annual payment of
approximately $06 million to, and will reimburse out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by, Culbro in connection with such services.
7. INCOME TAXES
For all periods prior to the Distribution, Griffin results of operations
were included in Culbro consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns and all
tax liabilities were paid by Culbro. Accordingly, Griffin income taxes payable
were included in Culbro Investment through the date of the Distribution.
Subsequent to the Distribution, Griffin will file separate tax returns from its
former parent company. The income tax provisions and deferred tax liabilities in
the accompanying financial statements have been calculated in accordance with
SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes as if Griffin had filed separate tax
returns for the periods prior to the Distribution. The income tax benefit
provision for fiscal 1997, fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1995 are summarized as

In connection with the Distribution Agreement, Culbro and Griffin entered
into a Tax Sharing Agreement which provided, among other things, for the
allocation between Culbro and Griffin of federal, state, local and foreign tax
liabilities for all periods through the Distribution. With respect to the
consolidated tax returns filed by Culbro, the Tax Sharing Agreement provides
that Griffin will be liable for any amounts that it would have been required to
pay with respect to any deficiencies assessed, generally as if it had filed
separate tax returns.

Less: due within one     244    277
Total long-term  $  2,830 $ 38,846
The decrease in long-term debt reflects the effect of the Liability
Assumption, whereby, on February 27, 1997, in accordance with the Distribution
Agreement see Note 2, GC Holdings assumed Culbro general corporate debt that
had been included in Griffin historical financial statements. Accordingly,
this

8. LONG-TERM DEBT CONTINUED
debt was not part of Griffin debt structure subsequent to February 27, 1997.
Interest expense incurred on Culbro general corporate debt that was included
in Griffin Statement of Operations was $07 million in fiscal 1997 prior to
the Liability Assumption and $73 million and $76 million in fiscal 1996 and
fiscal 1995, respectively. Culbro had entered into two interest rate swap
agreements with major banks as a hedge against interest rate exposure on its
variable rate debt. The effect of these swap agreements was to decrease interest
expense that is reflected in Griffin results of operation in fiscal 1996 and
fiscal 1995 by $01 million and $06 million, respectively, reflecting payments
received from the banks under these agreements.
As of November 29, 1997, the annual principal payment requirements under the
terms of the mortgages are $01 million for each of the years 1998 through 2002.
The mortgages are on two office buildings and three industrial buildings which
had a combined net book value of $37 million at November 29, 1997. The interest
rates on these mortgages range from 90% to 102%.
In October 1996, Griffin Land satisfied a nonrecourse mortgage of
approximately $38 million on a commercial property by transferring the property
to the lender in satisfaction of the outstanding mortgage. The net book value of
the property was substantially equal to the mortgage balance.
In November 1996, Griffin exchanged shares of preferred stock of Eli Witt in
satisfaction of the principal and accrued interest on a $15 million subordinated
note payable to a third party originally due August 1998. Interest expense in
fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1995 included $08 million and $09 million,
respectively, for amortization of the original issue discount on the
subordinated note.
Management believes that the amounts reflected on the balance sheet for its
mortgages reflect their current market values based on market interest rates for
comparable risks, maturities and collateral.
9. RETIREMENT BENEFITS
PENSION PLAN
Through the Distribution, Griffin employees participated in Culbro
noncontributory defined benefit pension plan. Pension expense of $01 million
per year for fiscal 1997 through the Distribution, fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1995
is included in the consolidated statement of operations, and reflects Griffin
direct share of Culbro consolidated pension expense based on the benefit costs
attributable to its employees, as determined by the plan actuaries.
In accordance with the Distribution Agreement, the pension plan was assumed
by GC Holdings. Effective at the time of the Distribution, Griffin terminated
its participation in the plan, and Griffin employees' years of service and
benefits accrued at that time were frozen at the date of termination.
Accordingly, Griffin did not incur pension expense subsequent to the
Distribution. All vested pension obligations as of the date of the Distribution
Agreement for Griffin current and former employees will be assumed by GC
Holdings.

SAVINGS PLAN
Subsequent to the Distribution, Griffin established the Griffin Land &
Nurseries, Inc. 401k Savings Plan Griffin Savings Plan for its employees.
Prior to establishment of the Griffin Savings Plan, Griffin employees
participated in the Culbro Corporation 401k Savings Plan Culbro Savings
Plan. Subsequent to the Distribution, amounts related to Griffin employees in
the Culbro Savings Plan were transferred to the Griffin Savings Plan. The
Griffin Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan whereby Griffin matches 60%
of each employee contribution, up to a maximum of 5% of base salary. Griffin
contributions to the Griffin Savings Plan and, prior to the Distribution, to the
Culbro Savings Plan were $01 million per year in fiscal 1997, fiscal 1996 and
fiscal 1995.
OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
Through the Distribution, Griffin employees participated in Culbro
postretirement benefits program which provides principally health and life
insurance benefits to certain of its retired employees. The annual cost of such
benefits attributable to Griffin employees under the plan benefit formula
was approximately $01 million per year in fiscal 1997, fiscal 1996 and fiscal
1995. In accordance with the Distribution Agreement, the liabilities for Griffin
employees who had retired prior to the Distribution and the liabilities for
employees related to businesses no longer a part of Griffin were assumed by GC
Holdings. The liability for postretirement benefits for certain of Griffin
active employees at the time of the Distribution remains with Griffin and is
included in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
Griffin liability for postretirement benefits, as determined by the Plan
actuaries, is shown below. None of these liabilities have been funded at
November 29, 1997 and November 30, 1996.

Discount rates of 75% and 775% were used to compute the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligations at November 29, 1997 and November 30, 1996,
respectively. Because Griffin obligation for retiree medical benefits is
fixed, any increase in the medical cost trend would have no effect on the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, service cost or interest cost.

Upon completion of the Distribution, Culbro converted all employee stock
options then outstanding under Culbro stock option plans into options to
purchase shares of common stock, par value $001 per share, of Griffin and
options to purchase shares of common stock of Culbro. The number of outstanding
options and exercise prices were adjusted to preserve the value of the Culbro
options. At the time of the Distribution, there were Culbro stock options
outstanding under the Culbro 1996 Stock Plan, the 1992 Stock Plan and the 1991
Employees Incentive Stock Option Plan, collectively, the Culbro Stock Plans
for officers and key employees. The options had been granted at prices equal to
the fair market value of Culbro common stock at the date of grant. A portion of
the options outstanding under these plans may be exercised as incentive stock
options, which under current tax laws will not provide any tax deductions to
Griffin. Substantially all of the Culbro options outstanding under the Culbro
Stock Plans that were converted to Griffin options were vested as of the date of
Distribution. None of the options outstanding at November 29, 1997 under the
Culbro Stock Plans may be exercised as stock appreciation rights.
At the time of the Distribution, there also were Culbro stock options
outstanding under the 1996 Stock Option Plan for Nonemployee Directors and the
1992 Stock Option Plan for Nonemployee Directors collectively, the Culbro
Nonemployee Plans. The options had been granted at prices equal to fair market
value of Culbro common stock at the date of grant. Additionally, at the time of
the Distribution, there were Culbro stock options outstanding in accordance with
the terms of an employment agreement entered into in May 1994 between Culbro and

GRIFFIN STOCK OPTION PLAN
Effective as of the Distribution date, Griffin established the Griffin Land

total of 700,000 shares of common stock were made available for issuance under
the Griffin Stock Option Plan. Of such 700,000 shares, 250,000 were made
available for issuance with respect to new options that may be granted to
certain officers, employees, consultants and directors of Griffin following the
Distribution. The remaining shares were made available for the conversion of the
Culbro options to Griffin options at the time of the Distribution see above.
The Griffin Stock Option Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors of Griffin. Options granted under the Griffin Stock
Option Plan may be either incentive stock options or non-qualified stock
options. Incentive stock options issued under the Griffin Stock Option Plan will
satisfy certain Internal Revenue Code requirements applicable thereto. All of
the options granted under the Griffin Stock Option Plan subsequent to the
Distribution were granted at prices equal to fair market value of Griffin common
stock at the date of grant and become vested in equal increments on the third,
fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date. The options granted subsequent
to the Distribution under the Griffin Stock Option Plan expire ten years from
the date of grant. A summary of the activity related to options issued
subsequent to the Distribution under the Griffin Stock Option Plan is as

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
In October 1995, the FASB issued Statement No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. This statement establishes a fair value method of
accounting for, or disclosing, stock-based compensation plans. Griffin is
accounting for stock options under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and has adopted the disclosure
provisions of SFAS No. 123 which require disclosing the pro forma effect on
earnings and earnings per share of the fair value method
26
GRIFFIN LAND & NURSERIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA
10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY CONTINUED
of accounting for stock-based compensation. Griffin loss from continuing
operations and loss per common share from continuing operations would have been
the following pro forma amounts under the method prescribed by SFAS No. 123.
1997
Net loss as  $ 2,136
Net loss pro  $ 2,228
Net loss per common share as  $  044
Net loss per common share, pro  $  046
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions for grants in 1997; expected volatility of approximately 35%; risk
free interest rate of 615%; expected option term of 5 years and no dividend
yield for all options issued. Because Griffin was previously a subsidiary of
Culbro, the expected option term was developed using Culbro historical grant
and exercise information.
PER SHARE RESULTS
The pro forma weighted average shares used in the calculation of pro forma
per share results for fiscal 1997 was approximately 4,800,000. In February 1997,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 128, which requires companies to present basic earnings
per share and, if applicable, diluted earnings per share instead of primary and
fully diluted earnings per share. There was no material difference between pro
forma basic loss per share and pro forma diluted loss per share than the amounts
reported for pro forma primary loss per share.

12. EQUITY INVESTMENTS
INVESTMENTS IN CENTAUR AND LINGUAPHONE
In accordance with the Asset Transfers see Note 2, Culbro transferred to
Griffin its ownership of approximately 25% of the outstanding common stock of
Centaur, which is primarily engaged in the publishing business in the United
Kingdom. On September 3, 1997, Centaur distributed the common stock of its
subsidiary, Linguaphone Group PLC Linguaphone to Centaur shareholders.
Accordingly, Griffin received approximately 25% of the outstanding common stock
of Linguaphone. Griffin book value in its investments in Centaur and
Linguaphone was $118 million and $33 million, respectively, at November 29,
1997. Approximately $66 million of the book value of Griffin investment in
Centaur represents the excess of the cost of Griffin investment over the book
value of its equity in Centaur and is being amortized on a straight-line basis
over 40 years, which commenced in 1985.

OTHER EXPENSE
Other expense in 1996 includes the allocation to Griffin of charges recorded
by Culbro in connection with the termination of a management long-term incentive
compensation plan which was based on Culbro stock price, and the acceleration
of the vesting of benefits under that plan, and accruals for severance and
related expenses in connection with a headcount reduction at the Culbro
corporate office in anticipation of the Distribution. Griffin allocable share
of these expenses was determined substantially on the same basis as the
allocation of Culbro general and administrative expenses referred to in Note 6
and is considered by management to be reasonable.
OTHER NONOPERATING INCOME, NET
Included in other nonoperating income, net, in fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1995,
was the accrual of dividend and accretion income on the preferred stock of Eli
Witt that was held by Griffin, which was equal to the interest expense on the
subordinated note, that was satisfied by the exchange of the preferred stock in
1996. In 1995, other nonoperating income, net, also included expenses related to
Griffin support of the refinancing of Eli Witt.

SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION
Prior to the Distribution, interest and tax payments were made by Culbro on
behalf of Griffin. Griffin will be included in Culbro consolidated federal
income tax returns through the Distribution date see Note 7. Accordingly, tax
and interest payments made by Culbro are reflected in Net Transactions with
Culbro on the consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest payments were $10
million, $59 million and $60 million in fiscal 1997, fiscal 1996 and fiscal
1995, respectively, including payments of $07 million, $54 million and $54
million in fiscal 1997, fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1995, respectively, under
Culbro general corporate debt facilities that were either repaid by Griffin or
transferred to GC Holdings pursuant to the Distribution Agreement.
On February 27, 1997 in accordance with the Distribution Agreement, GC
Holdings assumed all of Culbro general corporate debt and certain other
liabilities, including retirement obligations, which were included in Griffin
historical financial statements through that date. On July 3, 1997 Culbro
distributed to its shareholders the common stock of Griffin. In 1996, Griffin
Land exchanged a commercial property in satisfaction of the outstanding
nonrecourse mortgage on that property. Also in 1996, Griffin exchanged preferred
stock of Eli Witt that it held in satisfaction of a subordinated note payable
and all accrued interest thereon. There was no cash paid or received in any of
these transactions, therefore they are not reflected on the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows.

15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
As a result of the Asset Transfers described in Note 2, Griffin acquired the
501% interest in Eli Witt previously held by Culbro. In 1993 and 1994, Culbro,
Eli Witt and other parties engaged in two complex acquisitions and
reorganizations, pursuant to which Culbro received significant distributions
from Eli Witt to repay debt, including substantial amounts Culbro had previously
borrowed from unaffiliated third parties to fund Eli Witt business. Culbro
subsequently loaned $5 million to Eli Witt. In 1996, Eli Witt filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Law. In connection with
such filing, Eli Witt sold all of its operating assets to another wholesale
distributor in March 1997. Shareholders of Eli Witt did not receive any proceeds
from the sale, and Griffin had no investment related to Eli Witt on its 1997 or
1996 consolidated balance sheets. These transactions including the transfer of
funds to Culbro have been reviewed by Eli Witt creditors and other parties in
interest in connection with Eli Witt Chapter 11 filing. Although Griffin
believes that any claim challenging the distributions described above would be
without merit, any such claim, if asserted and successfully prosecuted, could
have a material adverse effect on Griffin financial condition. Recently, the
bankruptcy court confirmed Eli Witt plan of reorganization. The Plan permitted
Eli Witt to sell certain real property on which Griffin holds a second mortgage.
In connection with a motion to approve the sale of such property, Griffin and
Culbro would be released from any liability to Eli Witt, the creditors of Eli
Witt and any party claiming by or through the bankruptcy estate of Eli Witt in
return for release of Griffin second mortgage on the property and a release of
its other claims in the bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court has not yet approved
the sale and the releases. As it is currently structured, the release is
contingent upon the sale. Furthermore, based upon recent communications from the
proposed buyer of the real property it appears unlikely that the sale and
related releases will be consummated. Management does not believe that this
matter will have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition of
Griffin.
Imperial has entered into a contract growing agreement with a supplier of
field grown plants. In accordance with the agreement, Imperial has agreed to
purchase inventory as it becomes available with an aggregate purchase price of

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Stockholders and Directors of
Griffin Land & Nurseries, Inc.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated statements of operations and cash flows present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Griffin Land & Nurseries, Inc. and
its subsidiaries at November 29, 1997 and November 30, 1996, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for the fiscal years ended November 29,
1997, November 30, 1996 and December 2, 1995, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the management of Griffin Land & Nurseries, Inc.; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We did not audit the fiscal 1997 financial statements of Centaur
Communications, Ltd., an investment which is carried at equity in the
consolidated financial statements see Note 12 and represents approximately
115% of consolidated assets. Those statements were audited by other auditors
whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to
the amounts included for Centaur Communications, Ltd. included in the
consolidated financial statements for the year ended November 29, 1997, is based
on the report of the other auditors. We conducted our audits of these statements
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for the opinion expressed above.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of Centaur Communications Limited
Dear Sirs:
CENTAUR COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES THE
GROUP
We have audited the consolidated balance sheet of Centaur Communications
Limited and its subsidiaries as at June 30, 1997 and the related consolidated
statements of operations, of changes in shareholders' equity and of the cash
flows which statements are not included herein for the year ended June 30,
1997.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The Company directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial
statements. It is our responsibility to form an independent opinion, based on
our audit, on those financial statements and to report our opinion to you.
BASIS OF OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United Kingdom and the United States.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
OPINION
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the Group for the year ended June 30, 1997 and have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
United Kingdom accounting standards vary in certain important respects from
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The application
of the latter would have affected the determination of consolidated net profit
for the year ended June 30, 1997 and the determination of consolidated
shareholders' equity and consolidated financial position as at June 30, 1997 to
the extent summarized in note 33 to the consolidated financial statements.
