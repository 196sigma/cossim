35 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of CIENA Corporation
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of cash flows and of changes in
stockholders equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of CIENA Corporation and its subsidiaries at October31, 2002 and
2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended October31, 2002 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

1THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Description of Business
CIENA, a leader in intelligent optical networking systems and software,
offers telecommunications network solutions to service providers and
enterprises worldwide. CIENAs customers include long-distance carriers, local
exchange carriers, Internet service providers, wireless and wholesale carriers,
systems integrators, governments large businesses and non-profit
institutions. CIENA offers network solutions that enable service providers to
provision, manage deliver economic, high-bandwidth services to their
customers. In early 2001, the telecommunications industry began a severe
decline, which has affected almost all of its segments, including equipment
suppliers like CIENA. That decline, which has continued in 2002, has caused the
market for CIENAs equipment to shrink substantially, with a resulting adverse
impact on CIENAs revenues and profitability.
Principles of Consolidation
CIENA has 24 wholly owned U.S. and international subsidiaries, which have
been consolidated in the accompanying financial statements. On June21, 2002,
CIENA acquired all of the outstanding capital stock, and assumed the options of
ONI Systems Corp. ONI, a NASDAQ-listed corporation headquartered in San
Jose, California. On March29, 2001, CIENA acquired all of the outstanding
capital stock, and assumed the options of Cyras Systems, Inc. Cyras, a
Delaware company based in Fremont, California. Both of these transactions
constituted a tax-free reorganization and were recorded using the purchase
accounting method.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
CIENA and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Fiscal Year
The Company has a 52 or 53week fiscal year, which ends on the Saturday
nearest to the last day of October in each year November2, 2002, November3,
2001, and October28, 2000. For purposes of financial statement presentation,
each fiscal year is described as having ended on October31. Fiscal 2001 was
comprised of 53weeks. Fiscal 2002 and 2000 were comprised of 52weeks.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the Company to make estimates,
judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue and expenses, together with amounts disclosed in the
related notes to the financial statements. Actual results could differ from the
recorded estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with
original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Investments
CIENAs short-term and long-term investments are classified as
available-for-sale and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Realized gains or losses and declines in value determined to be other than
temporary, if any, on available-for-sale securities will be reported in other
income or expense as incurred
CIENA also has certain other minority equity investments in non-publicly
traded companies. These investments are generally carried at cost as CIENA owns
less than 20% of the voting equity and does not have the ability to
41 exercise significant influence over these companies. As of October31,
2001 and October31, 2002, $161million and $161million of these investments
are included in other long-term assets, respectively. These investments are
inherently high risk as the market for technologies or product manufactured by
these companies are usually early stage at the time of the investment by CIENA
and such markets may never be significant. CIENA could lose its entire
investment in some or all of these companies. CIENA monitors these investments
for impairment and makes appropriate reductions in carrying values when
necessary. During fiscal 2002, CIENA recorded a charge of $166million from a
decline in the fair values of certain equity investments that were determined
to be other than temporary. No write-downs were recorded during fiscal 2000 or
fiscal 2001.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost
determined on the first-in, first-out basis. The Company records a provision
for excess and obsolete inventory whenever such an impairment has been
identified.
Equipment, Furniture and Fixtures
Equipment, furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost. Depreciation and
amortization are computed using the straight-line method over useful lives of
2-5years for equipment, furniture and fixtures and 2-10years for leasehold
improvements.
Internal use software and web site development costs are capitalized in
accordance with Statement of Position SOPNo98-1, Accounting for the Costs
of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, and Emerging
Issues Task Force EITFIssue No00-02, Accounting for Web Site Development
Costs. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage,
which consist primarily of outside services and purchased software license
costs, are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the
asset.
Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets Adoption of Statement 142
The Company has recorded goodwill and purchased intangible assets from
several acquisitions. See Note 2. Purchased intangible assets are carried at
cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the
straight-line method over the economic lives of the respective assets,
generally three to seven years. It is the Companys policy to assess
periodically the carrying amount of its purchased intangible assets to
determine if there has been an impairment to their carrying value. Impairments
of other intangibles assets are determined in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of SFAS No.
121.
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No141 Business Combinations SFAS No141
and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142 Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets SFAS No142. SFAS No141 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for business combinations. This statement requires
the purchase method of accounting to be used for all business combinations, and
prohibits the pooling-of-interests method of accounting. This statement is
effective for all business combinations initiated after June30, 2001 and
supercedes APB Opinion No16, Business Combinations as well as Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No38,
Accounting for Preacquisition Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises.
SFAS No142 addresses how intangible assets that are acquired
individually or with a group of other assets should be accounted for in
financial statements upon their acquisition. This statement requires goodwill
amortization to cease and for goodwill to be periodically reviewed for
impairment for fiscal years beginning after October31, 2001. SFAS No142
supercedes APB Opinion No17, Intangible Assets. The Company adopted the
provisions of this standard for its first quarter of fiscal 2002. 42 The following table presents the impact of SFAS 142 on net income loss
and net income lossper share had SFAS 142 been in effect for the fiscal

Concentrations
Substantially all of CIENAs cash and cash equivalents, short-term and
long-term investments, are custodied at four major U.S. financial institutions.
The majority of CIENAs cash equivalents consist of U.S. Government Federal
Agency Securities, short-term marketable securities, and overnight repurchase
agreements. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance
provided on such deposits. Generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand
and, therefore, bear minimal risk.
Historically, CIENA has relied on a limited number of customers for a
substantial portion of the Companys revenue. During fiscal 2002, Sprint and
ATT each accounted for at least 10% of CIENAs revenue and combined accounted
for 368. During fiscal 2001, Sprint and Qwest Communications each accounted
for at least 10% of CIENAs revenue and, combined, accounted for 505%. During
fiscal 2000, Sprint, Qwest Communications and GTS Network Ltd. each accounted
for at least 10% of CIENAs revenue and, combined, accounted for 609%. CIENA
expects that a significant portion of the Companys future revenue will
continue to be generated by a limited number of customers. The loss of any one
of these customers or any substantial reduction in orders by any one of these
customers could materially adversely affect CIENAs financial condition or
operating results.
Additionally, CIENAs access to certain raw materials is dependent upon
single and sole source suppliers. The inability of any supplier to fulfill
supply requirements of CIENA could affect future results. CIENA relies on a
small number of contract manufacturers to perform the majority of the
manufacturing operations for its products. If CIENA cannot effectively manage
these manufacturers and forecast future demand, or of they fail to deliver
products or components on time, CIENAs business may suffer.
Revenue Recognition
CIENA recognizes product revenue in accordance with the shipping terms
specified and where collection is reasonably assured. For transactions where
CIENA has yet to obtain customer acceptance, revenue is deferred until the
terms of acceptance are satisfied. Revenue for installation services is
recognized as the services are performed unless the terms of the supply
contract combine product acceptance with installation, in which case revenues
for installation services are recognized when the terms of acceptance are
satisfied and installation is completed. Revenues from installation service
fixed price contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method,
measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to estimated
total costs for each contract. Amounts received in excess of revenue
recognized are included as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance
sheets. For transactions involving the sale of software, revenue is
recognized in accordance with Statement of Position No97-2 SOP 97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, including deferral of revenue recognition in
instances where vendor specific objective evidence
43 for undelivered elements is not determinable. For distributor sales where
risks of ownership have not transferred, CIENA recognizes revenue when the
product is shipped through to the end user.
Revenue-Related Accruals
The Company provides for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty
and other contractual obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue.
Such reserves are determined based upon actual warranty cost experience,
estimates of component failure rates, and managements industry experience. The
Companys sales contracts generally do not permit the right of return of
product by the customer after the product has been accepted.
Research and Development
The Company charges all research and development costs to expense as
incurred.
Advertising Costs
The Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No109 SFAS No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. SFAS No109 is an asset and liability approach that requires the
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their respective tax
bases, and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. In estimating
future tax consequences, SFAS No109 generally considers all expected future
events other than the enactment of changes in tax laws or rates. Valuation
allowances are provided if, based upon the weight of the available evidence, it
is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. Tax savings resulting from deductions associated with stock options
and certain stock warrants are credited directly to additional paid in capital
when realization of such benefit is fully assured and to deferred tax
liabilities prior to such point. See Note 13.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Companys financial instruments, which include
short-term and long-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
and other accrued expenses, approximate their fair values due to their short
maturities.
Foreign Currency Translation
The majority of the Companys foreign branches and subsidiaries use the
U.S. dollar as their functional currency, as the U.S. parent exclusively funds
the branches and subsidiaries operations with U.S. dollars. For those
subsidiaries using the local currency as their functional currency, assets and
liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet
date. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded directly to a separate
component of stockholders equity. Where the U.S. dollar is the functional
currency, translation adjustments are recorded in other income. The net gain
losson foreign currency re-measurement and exchange rate changes for fiscal
2000, 2001 and 2002 was immaterial for separate financial statement
presentation.
Computation of Basic Net Income Loss per Common Share and Diluted Net Income Loss per Common and
Dilutive Potential Common Share
The Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with the Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No128, Earnings per Share SFAS No128.
SFAS No128 simplifies the earnings per share EPScomputation and replaces
the presentation of primary EPS with a presentation of basic EPS. This
statement also requires dual presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face
of the income statement for entities with a complex capital structure and
requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used for the basic
and diluted EPS computations. See Note 11. 44 Software Development Costs
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No86, Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed SFAS No.
86, requires the capitalization of certain software development costs
incurred subsequent to the date technological feasibility is established and
prior to the date the product is generally available for sale. The capitalized
cost is then amortized over the estimated product life. The Company defines
technological feasibility as being attained at the time a working model is
completed. To date, the period between achieving technological feasibility and
the general availability of such software has been short and software
development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant.
Accordingly, the Company has not capitalized any software development costs.
Accounting for Stock Options
In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No123 SFAS No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS No123 allows companies to either account for
stock-based compensation under the new provisions of SFAS No123 or using the
intrinsic value method provided by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25
APB No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, but requires pro
forma disclosure in the footnotes to the financial statements as if the
measurement provisions of SFAS No123 had been adopted. The Company has
elected to continue to account for its stock based compensation in accordance
with the provisions of APB No25 as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No44,
Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, and
Interpretation of APB Opinion No25, FIN 44 and present the pro forma
disclosures required by SFAS No123. See Note 14.
Segment Reporting
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No131 SFAS No131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No131 establishes
annual and interim reporting standards for operating segments of a company. It
also requires entity-wide disclosures about the products and services an entity
provides, the material countries in which it holds assets and reports revenues,
and its major customers. The Company is not organized by multiple operating
segments for the purpose of making operating decisions or assessing
performance. Accordingly, the Company operates in one operating segment and
reports only certain enterprise-wide disclosures. See Note 16.
Newly Issued Accounting Standards
In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligation SFAS No143. SFAS No143 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June15, 2002, and will require companies to record a liability
for asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred,
which typically could be upon completion or shortly thereafter. The FASB
decided to limit the scope to legal obligation and the liability will be
recorded at fair value. The Company believes the adoption of this standard will
not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard No144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS No144. SFAS No144 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December15, 2001. It provides a single
accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of and replaces SFAS No.
121 Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets
to Be Disposed Of. The Company believes the adoption of this standard will not
have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard No145, Rescission of FASB Statements No4,
44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No13, and Technical Corrections SFAS
145. SFAS 145 clarifies guidance related to the reporting of gains and losses
from extinguishment of debt and resolves inconsistencies related to the
required accounting treatment of certain lease modifications. SFAS 145 is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after May
15, 2002. The Company believes the adoption of this standard will not have a
material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 45 In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No146, Accounting for Costs Associated with
Exit or Disposal Activities SFAS No146. SFAS 146 nullifies previous
guidance on accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities
and requires a liability for these costs to be recognized and measured at its
fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. SFAS 146 is
effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December31, 2002.
The Company believes the adoption of this standard will not have a material
effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Reclassification
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current
year consolidated financial statement presentation.     2
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS ONI Systems
On February18, 2002, CIENA announced that it had entered into an
agreement to acquire by merger ONI Systems Corp. ONI, a NASDAQ-listed
corporation headquartered in San Jose, California. ONI is a provider of optical
networking equipment specifically designed to address bandwidth and service
limitations of regional and metropolitan networks. Under the terms of the
agreement, each outstanding share of capital stock of ONI was exchanged for
07104 shares of CIENA common stock, and CIENA assumed all ONI outstanding
options and warrants as well as the ONI outstanding convertible debt. The
acquisition was consummated on June21, 2002. The stockholders of ONI received
101,120,724 shares of CIENA common stock of which 1,039,429 are restricted and
subject to repurchase.
Additionally, CIENA converted approximately 18,193,345 ONI options and
warrants into 12,924,552 options and warrants to purchase CIENA common stock.
The aggregate purchase price was $9782million, including CIENA common stock
valued at $8757million, CIENA options, warrants and restricted stock valued
at $892million and transaction costs of $133million. In determining the
purchase price, CIENA used an estimated value of CIENA common stock of
approximately $875 per share based on the average closing price of CIENAs
common stock for the two trading days before the February18, 2002 announcement
and the two trading days after the announcement.

No amount of the purchase price was assigned to in-process research and
development. In-process research and development is purchased in-process
technology that, as of the date of the acquisition, had not reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. Based on valuation
assessments, the value of these projects was determined by estimating the
resulting net cash flows from the sale of the products resulting from the
completion of the projects, reduced by the portion of the revenue attributable
to developed technology and the percentage of completion of the project. The resulting cash flows were then discounted back to
their present values at appropriate discount rates. 46 The $130million assigned to the value of existing technology represents
purchased technology for which development had been completed as of the date of
acquisition. This amount was determined using the income approach. This method
consisted of estimating future net cash flows attributable to existing
technology for a discrete projection period and discounting the net cash flows
to their present value. The existing technology will be amortized over a
seven-year period. The $21million assigned to the other intangible assets,
non-compete agreements and contracts, will be amortized over a range of two
months to one year.
During the quarter ended July31, 2002, CIENA and ONI reduced their
combined workforce by approximately 283 employees. Approximately $38million
of costs associated with the ONI workforce reduction qualify for treatment
under EITF 95-3 Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase
Combination and were recorded as an element of the acquisition.
The $802million assigned to the value of the unfavorable lease
commitments was based upon the present value of the assumed lease obligations
based upon current rental rates at the time of the acquisition. These
unfavorable lease commitments will be paid over the respective lease terms
through fiscal 2011. The $2180million assigned to the value of the ONI
$3000million principal amount of 50% convertible subordinated notes due
October15, 2005 was based upon the present value of the notes at the time of
the acquisition. CIENA is accreting the difference between the present value of
the notes and the outstanding principal value over the remaining period to
October15, 2005, such that the carrying value of the notes equals the
principal value at the time the notes become due.
The amount of goodwill allocated to the purchase price was $5909million
and is not deductible for tax purposes. The Company operates in one operating
segment and reports only certain enterprise-wide disclosures. Accordingly, the
goodwill from this transaction is not part of a reportable segment.
The following unaudited pro forma data summarizes the results of
operations for the period indicated as if the ONI acquisition had been
completed as of the beginning of the periods presented. The unaudited pro forma
data gives effect to actual operating results prior to the June21, 2002
acquisition, adjusted to include the pro forma effect of amortization of
intangibles, deferred stock compensation costs, and the tax effects to the pro

Cyras
On March29, 2001, CIENA acquired all of the outstanding capital stock,
and assumed the options of Cyras Systems, Inc. Cyras, a privately held
provider of next-generation optical networking systems based in Fremont,
California. The purchase price was approximately $22billion and consisted of
the issuance of approximately 261million shares of CIENA common stock, the
assumption of approximately 19million stock options and the indirect
assumption of $150million principal amount of Cyras convertible subordinated
indebtedness. The Cyras K2 product, which has become CIENAs MetroDirector K2,
enables carriers of metropolitan area networks to consolidate multiple legacy
network elements into a single switching platform. 47 The transaction was recorded using the purchase accounting method with the

The amortization period for the goodwill and intangibles, based on
managements estimate of the useful life of the acquired technology, is three
to seven years. As a result of the issuance of SFAS No142, amortization
related to goodwill will no longer be recorded in subsequent fiscal years.
In connection with the Cyras acquisition, the Company recorded a $459
million charge in the period ended April30, 2001 for in-process research and
development. This represents the estimated value of purchased in-process
technology related to Cyras K2 product development that had not yet reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use at the time of the
acquisition. The amount of purchase price allocated to in-process research and
development was determined using the discounted cash flow method. This method
consisted of estimating future net cash flows attributable to in-process K2
technology for a discrete projection period and discounting the net cash flows
back to their present value. The discount rate includes a factor that takes
into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the
purchased in-process technology.
In connection with the Cyras acquisition, the Company recorded a $477
million intangible asset related to developed technology. This represents the
estimated value of the portion of the purchased technology for which
development had been completed. The amount of purchase price allocated to
purchased technology was determined using the income approach. This method
consisted of estimating future net cash flows attributable to existing K2
technology for a discrete projection period and discounting the net cash flows
back to their present value.

RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES Restructuring 48 During the fiscal year ended October31, 2001, the Company recorded a
restructuring charge of $154million relating to consolidation of excess
facilities. The consolidation of excess facilities included the closure of
certain manufacturing warehouse facilities and the consolidation of certain
operational centers related to business activities that have been restructured.
The charge included $70million primarily related to lease terminations and
non-cancelable lease costs and also included an $84million write-down related
to property and equipment consisting primarily of leasehold improvements and
production equipment.
On November12, 2001, the Company announced a workforce reduction of
approximately 380 employees concentrated in manufacturing operations staff. The
Company recorded a restructuring charge of $68million associated with this
action in the first quarter of fiscal 2002.
On February5, 2002, CIENA announced a workforce reduction of
approximately 400 employees largely concentrated in manufacturing operations
and research and development activities associated with the closure of CIENAs
Marlborough, Massachusetts research and development facility. On March26,
2002, CIENA announced a company-wide workforce reduction of approximately 650
employees. CIENA recorded a restructuring charge of $1214million associated
with the workforce reductions, lease terminations, non-cancelable lease costs
and the write-down of certain property, equipment and leasehold improvements
associated with this action in the second quarter of fiscal 2002.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, CIENA and ONI reduced their
combined workforce by approximately 283 employees. Approximately $38million
of costs associated with the ONI workforce reduction qualify for treatment
under EITF 95-3 Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase
Combination and were recorded as an element of the acquisition. As a result of
these integration and restructuring activities, CIENA recorded a charge of
$110million during the quarter ended July31, 2002 associated with workforce
reductions of approximately 66 employees, lease terminations, non-cancelable
lease costs and the write-down of certain property, equipment and leasehold
improvements. Also during the quarter ended July31, 2002, the Company recorded
an additional restructuring charge of approximately $76million to increase
the estimated cost of the net lease expense for previously restructured
facilities.
On September20, 2002, CIENA announced a company-wide workforce reduction
of approximately 450 employees. The Company recorded a restructuring charge of
$787million associated with the workforce reductions, lease terminations,
non-cancelable lease costs and the write-down of certain property, equipment
and leasehold improvements associated with this action in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2002. 49 The following table displays the activity and balances of the

During the twelve months ended October31, 2002, approximately 1,946 CIENA
employees were terminated. The remaining balance of the charges associated with
the workforce reductions will be paid by the second quarter of fiscal 2003.
Since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company has recorded a net
charge of $1222million related to the write-down and disposal of certain
property, equipment and leasehold improvements. These assets are being carried
at their fair market value less selling and disposal costs. The remaining
facilities balance is related to the net lease expense. This will be paid over
the respective lease terms through fiscal 2019.
Impairment Charges
The Company adopted SFAS No142 effective November1, 2001 and upon
adoption ceased to amortize goodwill. On adoption of SFAS No142, the Company
determined that its operations represent a single reporting unit. The Company
completed an impairment review of the goodwill associated with its reporting
unit during the three months ended January31, 2002. The Company compared the
fair value of its reporting unit at November1, 2001 to the carrying value
including goodwill for the unit at November1, 2001, and determined that the
carrying value, including goodwill, did not exceed the units fair value. As a
result, no impairment charge was required on adoption.
In accordance with SFAS 142, which requires annual testing to determine
and measure goodwill impairment on a reporting unit basis, and with the
assistance from independent valuation experts management performed an
assessment of the fair value of the Companys single reporting unit and its
intangible assets as of September30, 2002. The Company compared its fair value
to its carrying value including goodwill and determined that its carrying
value, including goodwill, exceeded fair value. As a result, the Company then
assessed the fair value of its assets, including identified intangible assets,
and liabilities and derived an implied fair value for its goodwill. Since the
carrying amount of goodwill was greater than its implied fair value, an
impairment loss of $5573million was recognized.
The fair value of the Company was determined using the average market
price of the Companys common stock over a 10-day period before and after
September27, 2002 and a control premium of 25%. The Company determined the
estimated fair value of identified intangible assets and non-goodwill
intangible assets and liabilities using discounted cash flows. The cash flow
periods used were eight years, applying annual growth rates of 10% to 86%. The
Company used discount rates of 10% to 32% based of the specific risks and
circumstances associated with the identified intangible asset or other
non-goodwill assets or liability being evaluated. The assumptions supporting
the estimated cash flows for identified intangible assets and other
non-goodwill assets and liabilities, including the discount rate, reflects
managements estimates. The discount rate was based upon the Companys weighted
average cost of capital as adjusted for the risks associated with its
operations. 50 The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the fiscal year 2002
are as follows in thousands

As part of CIENAs review of financial results for fiscal 2001, CIENA
performed an assessment of the carrying value of the Companys long-lived
assets including significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets
recorded in connection with the acquisition of Cyras. The assessment was
performed pursuant to Statement Financial Accounting Standards No121
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets
to be Disposed Of SFAS 121 because of the significant negative industry and
economic trends affecting both the Companys current operations and expected
future sales of MetroDirector K2 as well as the general decline of technology
valuations. The conclusion of that assessment was that the decline in market
conditions within the Companys industry was significant and other than
temporary. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $17billion to reduce
goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2001 based on the amount by which the
carrying amount of these assets exceeded their fair value. The write down is
related to the goodwill associated with the Cyras transaction. Fair value was
determined based on discounted future cash flows for the operating entity,
which had separately identifiable cash flows. The cash flow periods used were
six years, applying annual growth rates of 25% to 100%. The discount rate used
was 113%, and the terminal value was estimated based upon terminal growth
rates of 4%. The assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows,
including the discount rate and estimated terminal values reflect managements
best estimates. The discount rate was based upon the Companys weighted average
cost of capital as adjusted for the risks associated with its operations.     4

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE As of October31, 2002, the trade accounts receivable included three
customers who each accounted for 193%, 150%, and 128% of the trade accounts
receivable, respectively. As of October31, 2001, the trade accounts
receivable included three customers who each accounted for 38%, 18%, and 15%
of the trade accounts receivable, respectively.
CIENA performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally
has not required collateral or other forms of security from its customers.
CIENA maintains an allowance for potential losses on a specific identification
basis. CIENAs allowance for doubtful accounts as of October31, 2002 and
October31, 2001 was $95million and $15million, respectively. CIENA
expected to realize approximately $89million of the gross outstanding
accounts receivable balance of $369million due from iaxis Limited as of
October31, 2000. In fiscal 2001, CIENA received payment for approximately
$154million of the gross outstanding accounts receivable balance due from
iaxis Limited primarily through the Companys sales agreement with Dynegy.
Accordingly, CIENA recognized a reduction in the provision for doubtful
accounts of $66million during fiscal year 2001. CIENA recorded a provision
for doubtful accounts of approximately $148million during fiscal 2002. This
provision relates to the estimated losses of $181million from three
customers, each of whom filed for bankruptcy protection during fiscal 2002,
offset by a payment of $33million of the gross outstanding accounts
receivable balance due from iaxis Limited through the Companys sales
agreement with Dynegy.

The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or
unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory
and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and
market conditions. As a result of the further decline in capital spending by
the Companys customers and a further decline in forecasted revenues of
existing products in fiscal 2002, the Company recorded a provision for excess
inventory and purchase commitments of $2865million, which included charges
of $2505million for excess inventory and obsolescence and $360million for

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Authorized Shares
On March12, 2001, the shareholders of the Company approved an increase to
the number of authorized shares of common stock from 460million to 980million
shares.
Stock Split
The Board of Directors authorized the splitting of the Companys common
stock on a two-for-one basis for shareholders of record on August28, 2000 and
the resulting shares from the split were distributed on September18, 2000.
All references to share and per-share data for all periods presented have been
adjusted to give effect to this two-for-one stock split.
Stockholder Rights Plan
In December 1997, the Companys Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder
Rights Plan. This plan is designed to deter any potential coercive or unfair
takeover tactics in the event of an unsolicited takeover attempt. It is not
intended to prevent a takeover of the Company on terms that are favorable and
fair to all shareholders and will not interfere with a merger approved by the
Board of Directors. Each right entitles shareholders to buy a unit equal to
one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock of the Company. The rights
will be exercisable only if a person or a group acquires or announces a tender
or exchange offer to acquire 15% or more of the Companys common stock or if
the Company enters into certain other business combination transactions not
approved by the Board of Directors.
In the event the rights become exercisable, the rights plan allows for CIENA
shareholders to acquire stock of the surviving corporation, whether or not
CIENA is the surviving corporation, having a value twice that of the exercise
price of the rights. The rights were distributed to shareholders of record in
January 1998. The rights will expire December 2007 and are redeemable for
$0001 per right at the approval of the Companys Board of Directors.
Public Offerings
56 On February9, 2001, CIENA completed a public offering of 11,000,000
shares of common stock at a price of $8350 per share less underwriters
discounts and commissions. Net proceeds from the public offering were
approximately $8785million, after deducting underwriting discounts,
commissions and offering expenses. Pending use of the net proceeds, the Company
has invested them in interest bearing, investment grade securities.

During fiscal 2002, the Company established a valuation allowance against
its deferred tax assets. The Company intends to maintain a valuation allowance
until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal.
As of October31, 2002, the Company had a $15billion net operating loss
carry forward and a $632million income tax credit carry forward which begin
to expire in fiscal year 2020 and 2012 respectively. The Companys ability to
use net operating losses and credit carry forwards may be subject to
limitations pursuant to the ownership change rules of the Internal Revenue Code
Section382.
The income tax provision does not reflect the tax savings resulting from
deductions associated with the Companys stock. Approximately $832million of
the valuation allowance as of October31, 2002 was attributable to deductions
associated with the Companys stock, the benefit of which will be credited to
additional paid-in capital when realized. Tax benefits from deductions
associated with the Companys stock of approximately $1546million and $716
million in fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2001 respectively, were credited directly to
additional paid in capital.
Approximately $2523million of the valuation allowance as of October31,
2002 was attributable to deferred tax assets associated with the acquisition of
ONI, that when realized, will first reduce goodwill, then other non-current
intangibles of ONI, and then income tax expense.
58 The IRS is currently scheduled to examine the Companys federal income tax
returns for fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2000. Management does not expect the
outcome of these examinations to have a material adverse affect on the
Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow.     14

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In March 1998, the shareholders approved the Corporations 1998 Stock
Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan under which 50million shares of common
stock have been reserved for issuance. Eligible employees may purchase a
limited number of shares of the Companys stock at 85% of the market value at
certain plan-defined dates. Approximately 1,927,000, 424,000, and 693,000
shares of common stock have been issued for $100million, $78million, and
$58million during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As of October
31, 2002 approximately 13million shares are available for issuance under this
plan.
Pro Forma Stock-Based Compensation
Had compensation cost for the Companys stock option plans and the
Purchase Plan been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for
awards in fiscal years 2000, 2001 and 2002 consistent with the provisions of
SFAS No123, the Companys net income and net income per share for fiscal 2000
would have been decreased and the net loss and the net loss per share for
fiscal 2001 would have been increased to the pro forma amounts indicated below

61 The weighted average fair value of each option granted under the various
stock option plans for 2000, 2001 and 2002 is $6499, $2792 and $488
respectively. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model with the following weighted
average assumptions for fiscal years 2000, 2001 and 2002

The Black-Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable. In addition, option pricing models require the input of
highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
The Company uses projected volatility rates, which are based upon historical
volatility rates trended into future years. Because the Companys employee
stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate, in managements opinion, the existing models do
not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the
Companys options.
Employee 401k Plan
The Company has a 401k defined contribution profit sharing plan. The
plan covers all full-time employees who are not covered by a collective
bargaining agreement where retirement benefits are subject to good faith
bargaining. Participants may contribute up to 60% of pre-tax compensation,
subject to certain limitations. The Company may make discretionary annual
profit sharing contributions of up to the lesser of $30,000 or 25% of each
participants compensation. The Company has made no profit sharing
contributions to date. The plan also includes an employer matching
contribution equal to 100% of the first 3% of participating employee
contributions each pay period, with a five year vesting plan applicable to the
Companys contribution with the exception that participants vest immediately
upon turning age fifty-five. Employees that involuntarily separated from CIENA
due to a reduction in force were also 100% vested in the employer match.
During fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002 the Company made matching contributions of
approximately $23million, $37million and $41million respectively     15
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Operating Lease Commitments
The Company has certain minimum obligations under non-cancelable operating
leases expiring on various dates through 2019 for equipment and facilities.

Rental expense for fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002 was approximately $137
million, $195million and $247million, respectively. In addition the Company
paid approximately $00, $00 and $72million related to rent costs for
62 restructured facilities and unfavorable lease commitments, respectively,
which was offset against the Companys restructuring liabilities and
unfavorable lease obligations, respectively.
Purchase Commitments with contract Manufacturers and Suppliers
The Company relies on a small number of contract manufacturers to perform
the majority of the manufacturing operations for its products. In order to
reduce lead times and ensure adequate component supply, the Company enters into
agreements with these suppliers which allows them to procure inventory for the
Companys forecasted future demands. As of October31, 2002, the Company has
purchase commitments of $356million.
Litigation
On October3, 2000, Stanford University and Litton Systems filed a
complaint in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California
alleging that optical fiber amplifiers incorporated into CIENAs products
infringe U.S. Patent No4,859,016. The complaint seeks injunctive relief,
royalties and damages. CIENA has still not been served in the case. CIENA is
currently engaged in discussions with the plaintiff regarding settlement of the
matter. CIENA is unable to determine whether the litigation or any settlement
CIENA may reach will have an adverse effect on us.
On July19, 2000, CIENA and CIENA Properties, Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of CIENA, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for
the District of Delaware requesting damages and injunctive relief against
Corvis Corporation. The complaint charges Corvis Corporation with infringing
three patents relating to CIENAs optical networking communication systems and
technology. On September8, 2000, Corvis filed an Answer and Counterclaim
alleging invalidity, non-infringement and unenforceability of the asserted
patents, and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage. On
February7, 2001, CIENA and CIENA Properties, Inc. filed an amendment to the
complaint to add two additional patents relating to CIENAs optical networking
communications systems and technology. On March19, 2001, Corvis filed an
Answer and Counterclaim to the amended complaint alleging invalidity,
non-infringement and unenforceability of the newly asserted patents. The
discovery phase of the litigation is now completed. The court has postponed the
trial, originally scheduled to begin on April1, 2002. CIENA anticipates that
it will now take place in February 2003. CIENA believes that Corvis
counterclaims are without merit, and intends to defend itself vigorously.
On August19, 2002, Pirelli S.p.A. and certain of its affiliates
Pirelli filed a complaint against us in the United States District Court
for the District of Delaware alleging that CIENA was in breach of the Companys
obligation to pay royalties under a license agreement that was part of the
resolution of an earlier series of disputes between us and Pirelli. CIENA has
reached an agreement with Pirelli to resolve the lawsuit. Under the terms of
the settlement, CIENA will pay Pirelli $110million, and Pirelli will forego
claims to all other royalties, past or future.
Upon acquiring ONI Systems, CIENA became the defendant in a lawsuit
originally brought on March10, 2000, against ONI by Nortel Networks in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The suit
alleges that ONI Systems products infringe a patent held by Nortel Networks,
and sets forth allegations of misappropriation of trade secrets, unlawful
business practices and common law unfair competition. Nortel Networks is
seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions and damages in connection with
its claims. If it were to obtain an injunction preventing the sale of the
allegedly infringing products, CIENA could lose revenue or be required to incur
expenses to modify the products to avoid infringement. CIENA could also be
ordered to pay damages, which could be substantial. CIENA believes, however,
that we have valid defenses to the claims, and CIENA intends to continue to
defend the lawsuit vigorously. Trial in the case is currently scheduled for
January 2003.
In addition, on November27, 2002, Nortel Networks filed a complaint in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging
that additional CIENA products infringe patents held by Nortel Networks. The
complaint seeks injunctive relief, royalties and damages. CIENA has still not
been served in the case. CIENA believes CIENA has good defenses to the
complaint, and if Nortel prosecutes it, CIENA intends to defend the action
vigorously. If Nortel Networks were to prevail, however, there is a possibility
that CIENA may have to negotiate a license agreement, pay substantial royalties
or modify the Companys products to avoid infringement.
As a result of the merger with ONI, CIENA also became a defendant in two
substantially identical purported class actions on behalf of ONI security
holders originally brought against ONI and members of its board of directors.
The complaints allege that the director defendants breached their fiduciary
duties to ONI in approving the merger with
63 CIENA and seek declaratory, injunctive and other relief permitted by equity.
The plaintiffs failed to obtain an injunction against completion of the merger.
CIENA believes that these lawsuits are without merit and will continue to
defend them vigorously. The first of these cases was filed on February20,
2002, in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Mateo,
and is encaptioned K.W. Sams, On Behalf of Himself and All Others Similarly
Situated v. ONI Systems Corporation, et al. The second case was brought on
March19, 2002, in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of
Santa Clara, and is encaptioned Steven Myeary, On Behalf of Himself and All
Others Similarly Situated v. ONI Systems Corporation.
As a result of the merger with ONI, CIENA also became a defendant in a
securities class action lawsuit. Beginning in August 2001, a number of
substantially identical class action complaints alleging violations of the
federal securities laws were filed in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York. These complaints name ONI, Hugh C. Martin, ONIs
former chairman, president and chief executive officer; Chris A. Davis, ONIs
former executive vice president, chief financial officer and administrative
officer; and certain underwriters of ONIs initial public offering as
defendants. The complaints were consolidated into a single action, and a
consolidated amended complaint was filed on April24, 2002. The amended
complaint alleges, among other things, that the underwriter defendants violated
the securities laws by failing to disclose alleged compensation arrangements
such as undisclosed commissions or stock stabilization practices in the
initial public offerings registration statement and by engaging in
manipulative practices to artificially inflate the price of the Companys
common stock after the initial public offering. The amended complaint also
alleges that ONI and the named former officers violated the securities laws on
the basis of an alleged failure to disclose the underwriters alleged
compensation arrangements and manipulative practices. No specific amount of
damages has been claimed. Similar complaints have been filed against more than
300 other issuers that have had initial public offerings since 1998, and all of
these actions have been included in a single coordinated proceeding. CIENA
intends to defend these actions vigorously.
On May3, 2002, a shareholder derivative complaint alleging violations of
California state law was filed in the Superior Court of the State of
California, County of Santa Clara against ONI. As a result of the merger with
ONI CIENA has also become a defendant in the lawsuit. The complaint names Hugh
Martin; the other members of the ONIs board of directors; Terrence J. Schmid,
ONIs former chief financial officer and vice president, finance and
administration; and certain underwriters of ONIs initial public offering as
defendants. The complaint alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary
duties, acted negligently and were unjustly enriched in determining the
offering price of ONI Systems common stock in ONIs initial public offering. No
specific amount of damages has been claimed. The complaint is encaptioned
Sabrina J. Kurzman and Michael J. Kurzman, Derivatively on Behalf of ONI
Systems Corp. v. Hugh C. Martin. In September 2002, CIENA filed a motion to
dismiss the complaint. The Companys motion to dismiss was granted by the
court on November6, 2002. On December 2, 2002, the plaintiffs
filed a notice of appeal from the courts order.     16
SEGMENT REPORTING In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No131 SFAS No131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No131 establishes
annual and interim reporting standards for operating segments of a company. It
also requires entity-wide disclosures about the products and services an entity
provides, the material countries in which it holds assets and reports revenues,
and its major customers. The Company is not organized by multiple operating
segments for the purpose of making operating decisions or assessing
performance. Accordingly, the Company operates in one operating segment and
reports only certain enterprise-wide disclosures.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On December12, 2002, CIENA filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission a Tender Offer Statement on ScheduleTO the ScheduleTO,
relating to an offer by CIENA to purchase the remaining outstanding $2029
million ONI 50% convertible subordinated notes. CIENAs purpose in seeking to
repurchase the notes is to reduce its annual interest expense and eliminate the
need to repay or refinance the debt at maturity in 2005. The tender offer is
not contingent on financing. The notes are convertible into CIENA common stock
at a conversion rate of approximately 77525 shares per $1,000 principal amount
held, subject to adjustment. The purchase price for the notes will be $860 in
cash per $1,000 principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but
not including, the date of payment. If CIENA succeeds in purchasing all of the
outstanding ONI notes at $860 in cash per $1,000 principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, CIENA will record a loss of $187million related to the
extinguishment of the ONI convertible subordinated notes. The loss is due to
the fact that the accreted value of the note is less than the purchase price.
CIENA will use the Companys cash and cash equivalents, and short-term
investment to fund the note purchase.
