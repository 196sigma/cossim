Item 5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2005 to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules
and forms.
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal
control over financial reporting will prevent all errors or fraud. An internal
control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints and the benefits of the controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all
internal control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues, errors and instances of fraud, if any, with
us have been detected.
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15f. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the results of this
evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of June 30, 2005.
Management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of June 30, 2005 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during our fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2005 that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Item 5. DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT

SECTION 16a BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires
our directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of our
common stock, to file reports of ownership on Form 3 and changes in ownership on
Form 4 or 5 with the SEC. Such directors, executive officers and 10%
stockholders are also required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all
Section 16a forms they file. Based solely upon our review of copies of such
forms received, or on written representations from certain reporting persons for
which no other filings were required, we believe that during the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2005, there was compliance with all Section 16a filing
requirements applicable to our directors, executive officers and 10%
stockholders, except due to administrative oversight, Mr. Albracht did not
timely report on Form 4 the sale of 1,250 shares of Mobius common stock during
