examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation.We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of SCOLR Pharma, Inc. as of
December31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  Board of Directors and Shareholders of SCOLR Pharma, Inc.
We have audited managements assessment, included in
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A in this annual report, that SCOLR Pharma, Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 because of the
effect of the material weakness identified in managements assessment, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. SCOLR
Pharma, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.  A companys
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control
deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The following material weakness has been identified and included in
managements assessment:  The Company did not maintain
appropriate control to provide reasonable assurance that complex transactions are appropriately accounted for or that all disclosure requirements under generally accepted accounting principles are fulfilled. In this regard, the Companys
processes are not sufficient to ensure that appropriate consideration is given to the accounting implications of such transaction, that accounting conclusions regarding these transactions are analyzed and documented, or that all relevant financial
statement disclosures required under generally accepted accounting principles are provided. Furthermore, the number of accounting personnel with sufficient experience is insufficient to ensure that the preparation and review of accounting analysis
relating to such transactions is performed by different individuals. 
33 Table of Contents
This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests
applied in our audit of the 2005 financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 17, 2006 on those financial statements.  In our opinion, managements assessment that SCOLR Pharma, Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2005 is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Also in our opinion,
because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, SCOLR Pharma Inc. has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 based
on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.  /s/GRANT THORNTON LLP  Seattle, WA March 17, 2006

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003  Note
ADescription of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  SCOLR Pharma, Inc. the Company is a drug delivery company that develops and formulates pharmaceutical, over-the-counter, and nutritional products. The Company uses its patented Controlled Delivery
Technologies CDT to develop products and license
technology to pharmaceutical and nutritional product companies. Prior to January1, 2004, the Company also manufactured and packaged probiotic products, developed proprietary nutritional product formulations, and offered specialty nutraceutical
ingredients, including several that utilize CDT technologies. Since 2002, the Company has transformed its business from a nutraceutical company specializing in probiotic formulations to a company concentrating on developing and commercializing drug
delivery technology. The Companys transition to a focused specialty pharmaceutical business was completed with the sale of its probiotics business effective as of December31, 2003.  The Company has incurred net losses since 2000. As of December31, 2005,
the Companys accumulated deficit was $36,310,448. The Company expects its operating losses and negative cash flow to continue as it advances preclinical research and clinical trials, applies for regulatory approvals, develops its product
candidates, expand its operations, and develops the infrastructure to support commercialization of its products.  The Companys business is subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with development of drug delivery systems and products. These risks
include, but are not limited to, a history of net loses, technological changes, dependence on collaborations and key personnel, the successful commercialization of our product candidates, compliance with government regulations, patent infringement
litigation and competition from current and potential competitors, many of which have greater resources dependence on third party manufacturers, and a requirement for additional funding.  A summary of the Companys significant accounting policies consistently
applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements follows.  1. Cash and Cash Equivalents  The Company
considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates market value. The Company holds cash and cash equivalents and
marketable securities at several major financial institutions, which often exceed FDIC insured limits. Historically, the Company has not experienced any losses due to such concentration of credit risk.  2. Short-term Investments  Short-term investments are considered available-for-sale and are carried at
fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of shareholders equity. Interest on securities classified as available-for-sale is included in interest income. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted
for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. This amortization and accretion are included in interest income. Realized gains and losses are included in interest income.  3. Accounts Receivable  In 2005 and 2004, the majority of the Companys accounts receivable were due from companies that provide royalty income
from the use of the Companys CDT technology. Payments are received on a quarterly basis, usually within 45 days after the end of each quarter. 
39 Table of Contents SCOLR Pharma, Inc.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 
The Company determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by considering a number of factors,
including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, the companys previous loss history, the customers current ability to pay its obligation, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The
Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such accounts are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts.  4. Financial Instruments  The carrying values of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable,
and debt obligations approximate fair value based on the short-term nature of these instruments.  5. Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are provided for in amounts sufficient to relate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated
service lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lives of the respective leases or the service lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter. Leased property under capital leases is amortized over the service lives of the assets as the
leases substantially transfer ownership and have bargain purchase options. The straight-line method of depreciation is followed for substantially all assets for financial reporting purposes. The estimated useful lives in determining depreciation and
amortization are as follows:  Furniture and fixtures
3-5 years
Software
3 years
Machinery and equipment
3-10years
Leasehold improvements
3 years
Machinery and equipment under capital leases
3-10 years
6. Intangible Assets
Intangible assets include capitalized costs, technical
and product rights, patents, and trademarks. Capitalized costs principally include legal fees incurred with the application for patents and trademarks. Technical and product rights, patents, and trademarks are stated at cost and amortized to
operations over their estimated useful lives or statutory lives, whichever is shorter. The weighted average remaining amortization period of patents and trademarks at December31, 2005, was 67 years. The Company evaluates its long lived assets
for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable using a fair value approach. No such impairment was recognized for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, or 2003.
7. Revenue Recognition  Revenues recognized during 2005 and 2004, primarily consist of amounts
earned under royalty arrangements with related and third parties under which such parties are licensed to sell products that include technology developed or licensed by us. Such royalty revenues are recognized when earned, as reported to the Company
by itslicensees.  The Company also generates revenue from
collaborative research and development arrangements. Revenue under technology licenses and collaborative agreements typically consists of nonrefundable and/or guaranteed 
40 Table of Contents SCOLR Pharma, Inc.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 
technology license fees, technology access fees, and various milestone and future product royalty payments. Generally, revenues from up-front license fees
received for the development funding of a product under collaboration are recognized systematically over the development period of the related agreement when this period involves development risk associated with the incomplete stage of the
products development.  Revenue arrangements with multiple
elements are divided into separate units of accounting only when the delivered element has stand-alone value to the customer, there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items, and if the arrangement includes a
general right of return or refund relative to the delivered item, delivery of the undelivered item is in the control of the Company. If these conditions are met, consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on their respective
fair values, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units. Payments related to substantive, performance-based milestones are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the milestones, provided such
milestone payments qualify as separate units of accounting.  In
2003, revenue from the sale of nutraceutical products was recognized upon shipment to the customer.  8. Income Taxes  The
Company accounts for income taxes under SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the
Companys assets and liabilities, for net operating loss carryforwards, and tax credit carryforwards. The deferred tax assets and liabilities, net operating loss carryforwards, and tax credit carryforwards are measured using enacted tax rates
and laws that will apply when the assets and liabilities are expected to reverse. The Company provides a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized.  9. Research and Development Costs  Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with products
being developed internally as well as those products being developed under collaborative agreements with others. These expenses include related salaries and benefits, clinical trial and related clinical trial manufacturing costs, contract and other
outside service fees, and facility related costs. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. In instances where the Company enters into agreements with third parties for research, clinical trial, and related clinical trial
manufacturing costs, costs are expensed upon the earlier of when non-refundable amounts are due or as services are performed. Amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service, and may include upfront payments, monthly
payments, payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables or termination costs incurred in the orderly termination of services.  10. Earnings Loss Per Share  Basic earnings loss per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year and income available to common
shareholders. Diluted earnings loss per share include the effect of potential common stock, except when their effect is anti-dilutive. The weighted average shares for computing basic earnings loss per share, including those common shares subject
to registration rights and potential liquidating damages classified on the balance sheet as temporary equity, were 34,323,934 for the year ended December31, 2005, 29,781,604 for the year ended December31, 2004, and 21,518,982 for the
year ended December31, 2003. At December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 options and warrants to purchase 5,693,996, 5,379,787 and 4,201,607 shares respectively of common stock, prior to the application of the treasury stock method, were not
included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share as they are anti-dilutive. 
41 Table of Contents SCOLR Pharma, Inc.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 
11. Stock-Based Compensation  The Company has an Equity Incentive Stock Option plan, which is described more fully in Note N. The Company applies APB
Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for equity based compensation awards issued to employees. Under APB 25 compensation expense for employee and director stock options is based on
the intrinsic value of the award which is equivalent to the excess, if any, of the fair value of the Companys common stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the option. Deferred compensation is amortized over the vesting period
of the individual options, using the straight-line method.  Generally, when the Company issues options to employees the exercise price of the option equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant; therefore no corresponding compensation expense is recognized. With the
adoption of the Companys 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, non-employee directors were allowed to elect to receive the value of their quarterly retainer fee for services either in the form of cash or a stock-based director fee award, which consisted
of either fully vested stock options with an exercise price equal to 50% of the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant, or stock units. A stock unit is an unfunded bookkeeping entry representing a right to receive one
share of the Companys common stock. Non-employee directors are not required to pay any additional cash consideration in connection with the settlement of a stock unit award. To the extent that directors elected to receive a stock-based award,
stock compensation expense was recognized based on the grant date intrinsic value of the stock option or the fair value of the stock unit. In December 2005, the non-employee director compensation program was revised such that non-employee directors
may no longer elect to receive stock options or stock units rather than cash in satisfaction of their quarterly fees for services. In addition, in December 2005, the Company settled certain stock options previously issued to directors for their
quarterly fees for services. see Note N.  The Company has
adopted the disclosure only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123 as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No148, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure SFAS 148. If the Company had elected to recognize employee stock compensation expense based on the fair value at the grant date for all awards under these plans consistent with the methodology
prescribed by SFAS 123 using the assumptions described in Note N, its net loss and loss per share would change to the pro forma amounts indicated below.  2005 2004Restated 2003 Net loss As reported 8,886,063 5,747,681 8,742,537 Employee stock-based compensation expense determined under fair-value-based method 2,510,471 615,710 877,643 Employee stock-based compensation expense included in reported net loss 75,500 15,000 896,955 Pro forma net loss 11,321,034 6,348,391 8,723,225 Net loss per share As reported 026 019 041 Pro forma 033 021 041

123 and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services EITF 96-18, at the fair value of the
consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measured. The fair value of options granted to non-employees is measured as of the earlier performance commitment date or the date at which
performance is complete the measurement date. When it is necessary under generally accepted accounting principles to recognize cost of the transaction during financial reporting periods prior to the measurement date, the fair value of
options granted to non-employees is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest.  12. Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported revenue recognition amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are used for, but not limited
to those used in revenue recognition, the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts, depreciable lives of assets, estimates and assumptions used in the determination of fair value of stock options and warrants, and deferred tax valuation
of allowances. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly, the accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements may change as
new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Companys operating environment changes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  13. Reclassifications  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications
primarily include disclosure on separate line items in the 2004 Statement of Stockholders Equity of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants which were previously classified as proceeds from the issuance of common stock.
14. New Accounting Pronouncements  In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement 123R Share-Based Payment, which requires companies to recognize in the income statement the fair value of all employee share-based payments, including grants of employee stock options as well as compensatory employee stock
purchase plans. The original implementation date was for interim periods beginning after June15, 2005. In March 2005, a staff accounting bulletin No107 deferred the implementation dates for annual and interim periods beginning after
December15, 2005. As a result, this standard will become effective for the Company beginning on January1, 2006. SFAS 123R eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation using APB 25, and the pro forma disclosures
previously permitted under SFAS 123 no longer will be an alternative to the recognition of employee stock based compensation at fair value. The Company believes the adoption of SFAS 123R will have a material impact on its statements of operations
in future periods. The Company plans to implement FAS 123R using the Modified-Prospective Transition Method.  In May 2005, as part of their effort to improve the comparability of cross-border financial reporting, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
issued Statement 154, Accounting Changes and Error 
43 Table of Contents SCOLR Pharma, Inc.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 
Correctionsa replacement of APB Opinion No20 and FASB Statement No3. This Statement changes the requirements for the accounting for and
reporting of a change in accounting principle. It applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle as well as to changes required by an accounting pronouncement where that pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions.
Opinion 20 previously required that these changes in
accounting principle be recognized by including the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle in net income of the period of the change. Statement 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements
of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. Statement 154 also requires that a change in depreciation or amortization be accounted for as a
change in accounting estimate brought about by a change in accounting principle.  Note BRestatement of 2004 Financial Statements  As disclosed in Note P, the Company issued shares of common stock and warrants to investors in a private placement transaction completed in February 2004. The Company filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission registering the resale of shares issued in the private placement and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued in the financing, which was declared effective as of April14, 2004. Under certain
circumstances, if the registration statement is unavailable for the resale of the specified securities, the Company may be required to pay in cash liquidated damages to each stockholder until the applicable event is cured. Based on recent
interpretations of accounting pronouncements related to the issuance of potentially redeemable common stock, principally Emerging Issues Task Force Bulletin D-98, Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities,
EITF D-98 the Company reassessed the accounting for the common shares issued in connection with the February 24, 2004 private placement and determined that since the common shares are subject to potential cash liquidated damages they
should be classified as temporary equity. EITF D-98 requires securities with redemption features that are not solely within the control of the issuer to be classified outside of permanent equity. Therefore, the Company restated shareholders
equity at February 24, 2004, to classify $7,954,715 associated with the issuance of 3,206,538 shares of common stock net of issue costs as temporary equity instead of permanent equity. At December 31, 2004, 2,635,760 of these common shares were no
longer subject to potential liquidated damages and therefore, $6,538,741 was transferred from temporary equity to permanent equity. At December 31, 2004, a total of $1,415,974 associated with 570,778 common shares continued to be subject to
potential liquidated damages and have been classified as temporary equity. As of December 31, 2005, the $1,415,974 relating to such shares was transferred to permanent equity as the maximum amount of potential liquidated damages was less than 10% of
the aggregate purchase price and reflected a reasonable estimate of the difference in fair value between registered and unregistered shares.  Emerging Issues Task Force Bulletin 00-19. Based on recent interpretations of accounting pronouncements related to these transactions, principally
Emerging Issues Task Force Bulletin 00-19, Accounting for Derivatives Financial Instruments Indexed to and Potentially Settled in, a Companys Own Stock, EITF 00-19 the Company has reassessed its accounting for the
warrants issued in connection with its 2004 financing. EITF 00-19 and interpretations thereof call for financial instruments such as warrants issued in the transactions to be accounted for as assets or liabilities at fair value when a net cash
settlement alternative is possible, even if not expressly provided for under the agreement. The related asset or liability is then periodically marked-to-market at each financial statement date until equity treatment can be applied, at which time
the value at the time is reclassified to equity. The possibility of a net cash settlement is presumed because the settlement of the warrants by issuance of unregistered shares and the payments of damages is not deemed to be an economic settlement
44 Table of Contents SCOLR Pharma, Inc.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 
alternative to the Company. Lastly, the ability of the Company to maintain effectiveness of its registration statement is not deemed to be completely within
its control.  The effect of the restatement on the 2004
financial statements was to reclassify as of February24, 2004, the estimated fair value of $1,527,245 associated with 801,636 warrants issued in the private placement from stockholders equity to a liability on the Companys
financial statements. The liability was subsequently marked- to-market at each interim reporting date and an associated non-cash unrealized gain loss was recorded in results of operations. The total non-cash unrealized loss reflected in the
restated 2004 results of operations was $834,866 or $003 per share. As a result, the Companys previously reported net loss of $4,912,815 or $016 per share in fiscal 2004 has been restated to $5,747,681 or $019 per share. On
December28, 2004, 76,923 of the 801,636 warrants were exercised. As a result, the exercised warrants were marked-to-market as of the exercise date and the estimated fair value of $228,952 was reclassified from liability to additional paid in
capital. The liability associated with warrants issued and outstanding at December31, 2004, was $2,133,160. The Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of the warrants.  The restatement described above also impacted our previously reported
operating results for each interim period in 2004 and for the first three fiscal quarters in 2005. The impact on operating results in these periods is disclosed in Note T.  Note CLiquidity  The Company incurred a net loss of approximately $88 million for the year ended December31, 2005, used cash from operations of approximately $82
million, and invested an aggregate of $05 million in the purchase of equipment and patents and technology rights. The Company had approximately $134 million in cash and short- term investments at December31, 2005. The Company plans to
continue the process of simultaneously conducting clinical trials and preclinical development for multiple product candidates. The Companys net losses are likely to increase as it continues preclinical research, applies for regulatory
approvals, develops its product candidates, expands its operations, and develops the infrastructure to support commercialization of its potential products. The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be
sufficient to fund its drug delivery business at planned levels through early 2007. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on the basis of a going concern which contemplates realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in
the normal course of business.  The Company will need to raise
additional capital to fund operations, conduct clinical trials, and continue research and development projects and commercialization of its product candidates beyond early 2007. The Company may raise such additional capital through public or private
equity financing, partnerships, debt financing, or other sources. Additional funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may curtail operations significantly including the delay,
modification or cancellation of research and development projects.

Note FSale of Probiotics and Notes Receivable  Effective December31, 2003, the Company sold its probiotics
development and manufacturing activities and assets to Nutraceutix, Inc., a Washington corporation. The new Nutraceutix entity was formed and is owned by Steven H. Moger, the Companys former Vice President of Operations, Chief Financial
Officer, and General Manager. Mr.Moger resigned his position as an officer of the Company in connection with the sale. The purchase price was $272 million, which included payment for certain inventories and tangible assets, as well as all
intellectual property related to the Companys probiotics development and manufacturing unit. In addition, the buyer assumed certain lease obligations. The Company received $722,756 cash at closing, with the remaining $2 million subject to the
buyers achievement of certain sales levels and royalties. Certain other indemnification obligations relating to title to the assets sold, compliance with laws, and certain matters relating to taxes continue until the expiration of the statute
of limitations applicable to claims with respect to such matters. As of the December31, 2003, transaction date, the carrying amount of assets and liabilities included in the sale transaction were as follows:  Assets Inventories 1,055,133
Prepaid expense 56,030
Property and equipment 1,133,967
Technical and property rights 114,975
Patents and trademarks 228,573 2,588,678 Liabilities Note payable 51,127
Lease obligations 202,120 253,247  The purchase price
included an initial payment of $722,756 and deferred consideration of $2 million. The deferred consideration included certain minimum royalty and other payments due each year regardless of the sales levels or royalty amounts calculated. Such
payments were due over a period equal to the longer of afour years, or buntil the deferred consideration exceeded $2 million. The Company calculated the present value of the $2 million based on estimated projected payments and using
a rate equal to the Federal Treasurys five-year treasury bill rate of 327% at December31, 2003. Since the minimum deferred consideration was known and the only contingency was the amount to be paid per year, the $1,844,328 present value
amount was included in the total purchase price in determining the gain or loss on the sale of assets and was treated as a note receivable.  Cash received at closing 722,756 Discounted note receivable 1,844,328 Liabilities assumed by purchase 253,247 Total proceeds 2,820,331 Carrying value of assets sold 2,588,678 Transaction expenses 330,544 Loss on sale 98,891  The Company concluded
that discontinued operations accounting did not apply to its probiotics activities because cash flows for the activity were not separate and distinct. 
47 Table of Contents SCOLR Pharma, Inc.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 
Through July 2005, payments were applied to the principal and interest on the note as received. In
August 2005, the Company entered into an amendment to the original agreement with Nutraceutix providing for settlement of the note receivable. The amendment limited the rights previously granted to Nutraceutix to manufacture and sell certain
extended release dietary supplement products to certain designated customers of Nutraceutix, eliminated the right to use the Companys trademarks, resolved certain disputes and eliminated the remaining minimum payments due under the original
agreement. The settlement resulted in the recognition of a loss of approximately $538,000 during the quarter ended September30, 2005, determined based on the difference between the remaining discounted minimum payments due under the original
agreement and the value of the consideration received of approximately $974,000, including a promissory note in the amount of approximately $759,000, and cash payments of approximately $215,000. The promissory note is payable in twelve monthly
installments beginning August31, 2005, and accrues interest at a rate of 5%per annum.  The exclusive license the Company originally granted to Nutraceutix to use the Companys CDT technology to manufacture and sell certain extended
release dietary supplement products is limited to certain designated customers of Nutraceutix. Commencing July1, 2005, the Company began receiving royalty payments on such sales at a reduced rate and such payments are recognized as royalty
revenue as they become due.  Notes receivable including
deferred consideration on the sale of the probiotics consist of the following at December31:  2005 2004 Note receivable from sale of probiotics unit; payments per agreement 505,927 1,708,650 Less current portion 505,927 430,951 1,277,699  Note GProperty and Equipment

JIncome Taxes  The Company recorded provision for
income taxes zero in all years presented differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 34% to its net loss. The sources of the differences are as follows at December31:  2005 2004Restated 2003 Tax benefit at statutory rate 3,021,261 1,954,212 2,972,462 Permanent differences 38,560 202,031 1,237,859 Expiration of net operating losses and credits 157,604 Increase decrease in valuation allowance 2,982,701 1,752,181 1,576,999  Deferred income tax
assets and liabilities reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are also recorded for
the future tax benefit of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows at December31:  2005 2004Restated Current asset, net Other current assets 193,183 95,489 Less valuation allowance 193,183 95,489 Non-current asset, net Net operating loss carry forwards 8,735,777 5,374,257 Depreciation and amortization 999 11,830 Other non-current assets 121,030 146,994 Less valuation allowance 8,857,806 5,533,081  The Company has
established a valuation allowance in the full amount of the net deferred tax asset balance as sufficient uncertainty exists regarding its ability to realize such tax assets in the future. The net increase in the valuation for the years ending
December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, was $3,422,419, $2,119,847 and $1,576,199 respectively.  At December31, 2005, the Company had available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $257 million of which $24 million related to
stock option deductions. Net operating loss carryforwards of $0, $0, and $456,104 expired during 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The net operating loss carryforwards begin expiring in 2006 and may be used to offset future federal taxable income
through the year ending December31, 2025. The 
50 Table of Contents SCOLR Pharma, Inc.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 
use of net operating losses may be limited in any given year under Internal Revenue Code Section382 upon the occurrence of certain events, including
significant changes in ownership interests which may have occurred, or which may occur in future years.  Note KTechnical Rights, Patent License and Royalty Agreements  The Company has agreements with Temple University Temple providing the Company with exclusive worldwide rights for certain patents related to its
Controlled Delivery Technology CDT, with the
right to sublicense. Under the terms of the agreements with Temple, the Company is required to make minimum annual royalty payments totaling $55,000.  On March25, 2002, the Company entered into an exclusive patent license agreement with Archer-Daniels-Midland Company ADM. Under the terms of the
agreement, the Company granted ADM a license to manufacture, use, and sell certain nutraceutical products covered by certain patents owned or licensed by the Company. During the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, the Company
recorded royalty revenues under this agreement of $36,601, $72,901 and $61,567 respectively. ADM has reported ownership of approximately 5% of the Companys outstanding common stock.  In August 2005, the Company entered into an amendment to the license agreement it originally granted to Nutraceutix. The
amendment limited the rights previously granted to Nutraceutix to manufacture and sell certain extended release dietary supplement products to certain designated customers of Nutraceutix, eliminated the right to use the Companys trademarks,
resolved certain disputes, and eliminated the remaining minimum payments due under the original agreement.Under the amended agreement, the license granted to Nutraceutix to use the Companys CDT technology to manufacture and sell certain
extended release dietary supplement products will be limited to certain designated customers of Nutraceutix. Commencing July1, 2005, the Company began receiving royalty payments on such sales at a reduced rate and such payments are recognized
as royalty revenue as they become due. The Company recognized revenue in the amount of $94,630 under this agreement in 2005. No revenues were recorded under the agreement in 2004 or 2003.  On October20, 2005, the Company entered into a Manufacture, License and Distribution Agreement with Perrigo Company of
South Carolina, Inc. Under the agreement, the Company granted a license to its CDT technology to Perrigo for the manufacture, marketing, distribution, sale, and use of specific dietary supplement products in the United States. In addition, Perrigo
may request that the Company develop additional dietary supplement products that use this technology to be added to the agreement. The Company will receive royalties based on a percentage of Perrigos net profits derived from the sales of
licensed products under the agreement. No royalty revenues have been earned under this agreement through December31, 2005.  On December21, 2005, the Company entered into an exclusive Development and License Agreement with Wyeth Consumer Healthcare Division, a division of
Wyeth. Under the agreement, the Company granted Wyeth an exclusive, worldwide license to the Companys CDT technology for the development, manufacture, and commercialization of products containing ibuprofen. Wyeth agreed to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to research and develop at least one ibuprofen product for the purpose of seeking regulatory approval for the commercialization of that product. The Company is obligated under the agreement to work with Wyeth on a coordinated
development program to complete the clinical development and commercialization of the initial ibuprofen product. The Company has the right to participate in the development of any additional products containing ibuprofen utilizing CDT technology
that Wyeth seeks to advance. 
51 Table of Contents SCOLR Pharma, Inc.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 
Wyeth has paid the Company an initial upfront fee of $250,000 and agreed to pay additional amounts
contingent upon the achievement of specified milestones during the product development period. Wyeth may also pay the Company a licensing fee and a technology transfer fee contingent upon the completion of certain specified events associated with
additional products containing ibuprofen. In addition, to the extent that the products receive regulatory approval and are marketed by Wyeth, the Company will receive quarterly royalty payments based upon a percentage of Wyeths annual net
sales of products covered by the agreement on a product-by-product basis.  The agreement provides for a twenty-year term based on the anniversary date of the introduction of each product covered by the agreement. After termination of the royalty period for a particular product, Wyeth will
have a perpetual and fully paid-up license with respect to such product.  Note LFuture Commitments  The Company
has certain material agreements with its manufacturing and testing vendors related to its ongoing clinical trial work associated with its drug delivery technology. Contract amounts are paid based on materials used and on a work performed basis.
Generally, the Company has the right to terminate these agreements upon 30 days notice and would be responsible for services and materials and related costs incurred prior to termination.  Note MRetirement Plan  The Company has a defined contribution 401k retirement plan the Plan which covers all employees. The Company will match 25% of employee contributions,
up to 8% of employee eligible compensation. The Company contributed $12,987, $7,597 and $15,594 to the Plan for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.  Note NStock Options  The Company has granted equity incentive awards to its employees, consultants, officers, and directors under its 2004 Equity Incentive Plan the
2004 Plan and its 1995 Stock Option Plan the 1995 Plan. The 2004 Plan was approved by stockholders in June 2004, and replaced the 1995 Plan. Under the 2004 Plan, equity-based incentive awards may be granted in the form of
stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, performance awards, outside director options, and director fee awards.  The options granted to employees are generally granted at exercise prices equal to the market value of the Companys common stock on the date of
grant, vest over three years, and expire ten years from the date of grant. Under the terms of the Companys non-employee director compensation plan, outside directors receive automatic annual grants of stock options at exercise prices equal to
the market value of our common stock on the date of grant, which generally vest in equal monthly installments over one year and expire ten years from the date of grant. In addition, prior to December 2005, non-employee directors could elect to
receive the value of their quarterly retainer fee for services in the form of a stock-based director fee award, which consisted of fully vested stock options with an exercise price equal to 50% of the fair value of the underlying common stock on the
date of grant.  The 2004 Plan authorized the issuance of up to
2,000,000 shares of common stock, plus 356,774 shares which were previously reserved for issuance under the 1995 Plan not subject to outstanding options. The number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2004 Plan will be increased by up to an
additional 1,357,795 shares subject to 
52 Table of Contents SCOLR Pharma, Inc.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 
options issued and outstanding under the 1995 Plan as of December31, 2005, which expire or otherwise terminate for any reason without having been
exercised in full. If any award under the 2004 Plan, or any award previously issued and outstanding under the 1995 Plan, expires, lapses or otherwise terminates for any reason without having been exercised or settled in full, or if shares subject to
forfeiture or repurchase are forfeited or repurchased by the Company, the shares underlying the award will again become available for issuance under the 2004 Plan. As of December31, 2005, the Company has 666,445 shares available for future
grants.  The fair value of option grants is estimated using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions for the years ended December31.  2005

At December31,
2003, the Company accelerated the vesting of 672,035 common stock shares of outstanding stock options for the employees terminated as a result of the sale of the probiotics unit. In addition, the options that normally would have terminated three
months after cessation of employment were extended to terminate at December31, 2004. As a result, the Company has recognized $896,955 of compensation expense according to APB Opinion 25 as amended by FIN 44 for the year ending
December31, 2003.  At September30, 2005, the
Company recognized $63,500 in expense related to stock options granted to directors who elected to receive the value of their quarterly retainer fee for services in the form of a stock-based director fee award. The expense recognized was based on
the grant date intrinsic value of the stock option. In December 2005 the Company revised the director compensation program such that directors will no longer be compensated through the grant of options with an intrinsic value on the date of the
grant. In conjunction with that change the Company settled 31,660 director options issued to directors for their quarterly retainer fees. In exchange, the Company paid $75,500, representing the difference between the quoted market price of the
underlying common stock on the date of cancellation and the exercise price of the stock options. As a result, the 
53 Table of Contents SCOLR Pharma, Inc.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 
Company recognized an additional $12,000 of compensation expense reflecting the excess of cash paid to settle the options over the intrinsic value of the
stock on the date of grant, and reversed $63,500 of additional paid in capital recognized with the original issuance of the options.  In 2005, the Company entered into an advisory services agreement with Michael N. Taglich, a member of its board of directors, relating to services
provided by Mr.Taglich as a consultant. Under the terms of the advisory agreement, the Company granted to Mr.Taglich a non-transferable option to purchase 100,000 shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $461.
The options, which vest in equal monthly increments over the two-year period of the service agreement beginning in 2005, have a ten-year term and are subject to a market condition that impacts the exercisability of the vested shares. These options
are subject to variable accounting in accordance with the EITF 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services. As of December 31, 2005, 4,167
options were fully vested but not exercisable due to the impact of the market condition. The fair value of the options as of December 31, 2005, of $387 per share was determined using the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions: stock
volatility 63%; expected dividend yield 0%; expected term 53 years; risk-free rate 39%. The fair value of the options will continue to be remeasured at each financial reporting period date until vested. The related consulting
expense is being recognized over the two year vesting period using the graded vesting method. The Company recognized $90,000 of expense in 2005 for these options.  The following is a summary of stock options outstanding at December31, 2005: Options Outstanding

Note PFinancing Events  Private Placements  On February8, 2005, the Company raised $150 million in gross proceeds through a private placement of 3,750,000 shares
of its common stock for $400 per share to accredited investors. The sale of these shares resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $141 million. The Company filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
as required under a registration rights agreement registering the resale of shares issued in the private placement including shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants issued to the placement agent, which was declared effective on
April15, 2005. If the registration statement does not remain effective for a specified period of time as defined in the registration rights agreement, until all shares tradable under the registration statement are sold, or until the shares are
freely tradable without volume restriction absent the registration statement, the Company is subject to cash liquidating damages equal to the aggregate purchase price of such purchasers remaining shares multiplied by 20% for every thirty days
that the registration statement is unavailable for sales. As of December31, 2005, a total of 2,436,500 common shares that remain subject to potential liquidating damages are classified as temporary equity.  Taglich Brothers, Inc. acted as the placement agent for the transaction and
received a cash fee of $750,000 and warrants, valued at $194,899 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, to purchase up to 75,000 shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $500 per share exercisable for five years. The
Black-Scholes valuation was based on the following assumptions: volatility of 67%; term of 5 years; risk-free interest rate of 372%; and 0% dividend yield. Michael N. Taglich is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company and is also an
affiliate of Taglich Brothers, Inc. The warrants issued to the placement agent are not subject to liquidating damages and are therefore accounted for as equity instruments.  On February24, 2004, the Company raised $104 million in gross proceeds through a private placement of 3,206,538
shares of its common stock for $325 per share to accredited investors. The sale of these shares resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $95 million. The purchasers also received five year warrants to purchase 801,636 shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $475 per share. The Company filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering the resale of shares issued in the private placement and the shares of common stock issuable
upon exercise of the warrants issued in the financing including shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants issued to the placement agent, which was declared effective as of April14, 2004. If the registration statement does not
remain effective until all shares tradable under the registration statement are sold, or until the shares are freely tradable without volume restriction absent the registration statement, the Company is subject to cash liquidating damages equal to
the aggregate purchase price of the purchasers remaining securities multiplied by 20% for every thirty days that the registration statement is unavailable for sales. Based on recent interpretations of accounting pronouncements related to the
issuance of potentially redeemable common stock, principally Emerging Issues Task Force Bulletin D-98, Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities, EITF D-98 the Company reassessed the accounting
for the common shares issued in connection with the February 24, 2004 private placement and determined that since the common shares are subject to potential cash liquidated damages they should be classified as temporary equity. EITF D-98 requires
securities with redemption features that are not solely within the control of the issuer to be classified outside of permanent equity. Therefore, the Company restated shareholders equity at February 24, 2004, to classify $7,954,715 associated
with the issuance of 3,206,538 shares of common stock net of issue costs as temporary equity instead of permanent equity. At December 31, 2004, 2,635,760 of these common shares were no longer subject to potential liquidated damages and therefore 6,538,741 was transferred from temporary equity to permanent equity. At December 31, 2004, a total of $1,415,974 associated with 570,778 common shares continued to be subject to potential liquidated damages and 
55 Table of Contents SCOLR Pharma, Inc.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 
have been classified as temporary equity. As of December 31, 2005, the $1,415,974 relating to such shares was transferred to permanent equity as the maximum
amount of potential liquidated damages was less than 10% of the aggregate purchase price and reflected a reasonable estimate of the difference in fair value between registered and unregistered shares.  The warrants issued to investors to purchase 801,636 of common stock were
also issued pursuant to the registration rights agreement and are subject to liquidating damage provisions. The Company considers the warrants to be derivative financial instruments and has classified the warrants as a liability at fair value in the
balance sheet. Information regarding the valuation of the warrants is as follows:  2004 2005 February24 December31 December31 Weighted-Average Fair Value Warrants 191 294 308 Black-Scholes Assumption Dividend Rate Average Risk-Free Interest Rate 301 363 435 Average Volatility 68 76 63 Contractual Life in Years 5 42 32
The change in the fair
value of the warrant in each period is reflected as an unrealized gain/loss on fair value in the accompanying statement of operations.  Rodman and Renshaw acted as the lead placement agent for the transaction and Taglich Brothers, Inc. assisted in the financing. The placement agents
received a cash fee of $729,487 and warrants to purchase 224,458 shares, of which Taglich Brothers, Inc. received $174,965 and warrants to purchase 53,846 shares. Michael N. Taglich and Robert Schroeder, directors of the Company at the time of the
financing, are affiliates of Taglich Brothers, Inc. In addition, Mr.Taglich purchased 49,631 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 12,408 shares of common stock as part of the private placement. The total fair value of the 1,046,773
warrants issued in the financing was $1,994,271 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes valuation was based on the following assumptions: volatility of 68%; term of 5 years; risk-free interest rate of 301%; and 0% dividend
yield. The warrants issued to the placement agent are not subject to liquidating damages and are therefore accounted for as equity instruments.  The Company also issued i32,000 shares of its common stock and a warrant to purchase 15,000 shares to an unaffiliated third party as a
finders fee, and ii23,077 shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase 5,679 shares in partial payment of an advisory fee in connection with the sale of the probiotics division.  Shelf Registration  On October27, 2005, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC, pursuant to which it may sell, from time to time, up to $40 million in common stock and/or common stock purchase warrants. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC in November 2005. The specific terms of any
future offering would be established at the time of the offering.  Convertible Notes Payable  On June25,
2003, the Company completed a private placement and issued $53million of Convertible Notes due June25, 2006. The transaction provided the Company with approximately $47million in net 
56 Table of Contents SCOLR Pharma, Inc.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 
proceeds. Interest accrues on the notes at 6% and is payable quarterly. Of the $53million of notes issued, $75,000 was issued to Herbert L. Lucas, a
director of the Company. The principal balance of the notes was convertible into shares of the Companys common stock at a conversion price equal to $105 per share, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. The Company exercised its right
to force conversion of all the notes into shares of the Companys common stock effective December15, 2003, because the common stock had traded at $210 or higher for 20 trading days within a 30-consecutive day trading period, as allowed
under the agreement.  In accordance with EITF98-5,
Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios, and EITF00-27, Application of Issue No98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments, an embedded beneficial
conversion feature should be recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds of the note equal to the intrinsic value of that feature to additional paid-in capital. That amount should be calculated at the commitment date as the
difference between the conversion price and the fair value of the common stock into which the note is convertible, multiplied by the number of shares into which the note is convertible intrinsic value. The fair value of the Companys common
stock on June25, 2003 was $177, resulting in a beneficial conversion feature of $072per share. As a result, the Company recorded a discount on the note for the beneficial conversion feature of approximately $36million, which was
recognized as interest expense over the earlier of the term of the notes 3yearsor upon the conversion of the notes into the Companys common stock. As a result of the conversion of the notes into common stock, the Company
recognized the entire amount of the discount as interest expense for the year ended December31, 2003.  In consideration of certain placement services, the Company paid Taglich Brothers, Inc. a cash fee of approximately $200,000, issued $300,000 of
convertible notes and issued warrants to purchase up to 476,191 shares at $1155per share. Michael N. Taglich, an affiliate of Taglich Brothers, Inc. became a director of the Company on August17, 2003. The fair value of the warrants was
determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: volatility of 72%, term of five years, risk-free interest rate of 336% and 0% dividend yield. The fair value of the warrants totaled approximately $586,000.
The total debt issuance costs of $1,250,813 were being amortized as interest expense over the earlier of the term of the notes 3yearsor upon conversion of the notes into the Companys common stock. As a result of the conversion of
the notes into common stock, the Company recognized interest expense of $13million for the year ended December31, 2003.  The Company filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering the resale of the shares of common stock issuable upon
conversion of the notes, which was declared effective by the SEC on November6, 2003.  Short-Term Notes Financing  Between April30, 2003 and May6, 2003, the Company issued $550,000 of subordinated notes to a group of accredited investors, including Herbert L. Lucas, a director of the Company, who purchased $75,000 of such subordinated notes.
The transaction provided the Company with approximately $505,000 in net proceeds. In conjunction with the sale of these notes the Company granted warrants to purchase 235,722 shares of the Companys common stock including 32,144 warrants
granted to Mr.Lucas at $111per share exercisable for three years. The notes were unsecured and did not accrue interest. The notes were paid in full on June25, 2003, with the proceeds received from the convertible note financing
discussed above.  The loan was discounted for the relative fair
value of the warrants totaling approximately $94,000, which was recognized as interest expense upon payment of the loan. The fair value of warrants was determined using 
57 Table of Contents SCOLR Pharma, Inc.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: volatility of 72%, risk-free interest rate of 225%, expected life of three years and
0% dividend yield.  For placement services associated with the
financing, the Company paid Taglich Brothers, Inc. a fee of $23,750 and issued warrants to purchase up to 20,357 shares of the Companys common stock at $111 per share exercisable for three years. The fair value of the warrants was valued
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the same assumptions as the bridge notes discussed above. The total debt issuance costs of approximately $44,750 were recognized as interest expense upon the payment of the notes.  Note QMajor Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk  In 2005, two customers accounted for 793% and 149% of total revenue. In
2004, the Company received royalty income for sales of product related to the CDT technology from two customers, which accounted for 84% and 16% of net revenues. In 2003, the Company had sales to three customers which accounted for approximately
21%, 21%, and 12% of net revenues. All 2003 sales were related to the probiotics manufacturing unit sold in 2003.  The Company maintains its cash balances in two financial institutions, which at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not
experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash.  Note RRelated Party Transactions  The Companys CDT platform is currently based on four patented drug delivery technologies and includes intellectual property from two U.S. patents licensed exclusively to the Company by Temple University and two
U.S. patents assigned to the Company by Dr.Reza Fassihi, a Professor of Biopharmaceutics and Industrial Pharmacy at the Temple University School of Pharmacy. Dr.Fassihi currently serves on the Companys board of directors.
Dr.Fassihi is also one of the inventors of the two patents licensed to the Company by Temple University. A portion of the royalty payment the Company makes to Temple University is, in turn, paid to Dr.Fassihi. In addition, the Company
has a consulting agreement with Dr.Fassihi. This agreement expires December31, 2006, but may be terminated by either party on 30-days notice. In the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, Dr.Fassihi was paid
$48,000, $48,000, and $36,000 respectively.  The Company
engaged Dunsford Hill Capital Partners Dunsford Hill in March 2003 to provide strategic and financial advice and to assist organizing and preparing the Company for a private equity financing. Dr.Randall Caudill, a director of the
Company, is the owner of Dunsford Hill. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company agreed to pay Dunsford Hill $75,000 over the six month term of the engagement and granted Dunsford Hill a five-year warrant to purchase 100,000 shares of common
stock at a price of $100 per share. In April 2003, Dunsford Hill agreed to reduce its cash payment to $25,000 and the amount of the warrant to 50,000 shares. 
Note SSubsequent Events  On January31, 2006, the Company received payment in full of the Note Receivable from Nutraceutix, Inc.  The Company entered into a severance agreement and release with Gail Vitulli,
its former principal financial officer, on February15, 2006. Ms.Vitulli discontinued service with the Company effective December15, 2005. Under terms of the severance agreement, the Company will provide severance and employee
benefits to Ms.Vitulli of approximately $84,000. In addition, Ms.Vitulli will have until December31, 2006, to exercise options to purchase 48,500 shares that were vested as of December15, 2005. 
58 Table of Contents SCOLR Pharma, Inc.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 
The Company also agreed to release Ms.Vitulli from all claims against her arising from or
relating to her employment with the Company, with the exception of any claims based on dishonesty or fraud. Ms.Vitulli agreed to release the Company from any and all claims against the Company, whether known or unknown, arising from or
relating to her employment with the Company.  Note TQuarterly Results
Unaudited  As discussed in Note B, the Company restated
its 2004 financial statements to reclassify certain warrants issued to investors from stockholders equity to a liability. As such, these warrants are accounted for at fair value and marked-to-market at each interim reported date. The table

Controls and Procedures  Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rule13a-15f. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by written policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of corporate assets; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that corporate
receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
corporate assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. A material weakness is a control deficiency within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Accounting PCAOB Standard No2, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in there being more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees in the normal course of their
assigned duties. During the course of this evaluation, management identified the material weakness described in the following paragraph.  As of December31, 2005, our internal accounting personnel did not maintain appropriate control to provide reasonable assurance that complex
transactions are appropriately accounted for or that all disclosure requirements under generally accepted accounting principles are fulfilled. In this regard, our processes were not sufficient to ensure that appropriate consideration was given to
the accounting implications of such transactions, that accounting conclusions regarding these transactions were analyzed and documented, or that all relevant financial statement disclosures required under generally accepted accounting principles
were provided. Furthermore, the number of accounting personnel with sufficient experience was insufficient to assure that preparation and review of accounting analysis relating to such transactions was performed by different individuals. As a result
of this material weakness, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the applicable COSO criteria. Management communicated its conclusions to the audit
committee of the board of directors.  Grant Thornton LLP, the
independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, has also audited managements assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, as stated in its report which appears herein. 
60 Table of Contents
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  During the course of assessing the effectiveness of both the design and
operation of our internal control over financial reporting, we implemented a number of significant improvements in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2005 and first quarter of 2006.  On December15, 2005, we replaced our principal financial officer with an interim chief financial officer to provide a higher level of leadership and experience for the finance
and accounting group.  We hired additional accounting personnel, including an assistant controller, and engaged outside contractors to ensure that accounting personnel with adequate experience, skills and
knowledge relating to complex, non-routine transactions are directly involved in the review and accounting evaluation of our complex, non-routine transactions.  We continued to work with an independent third party to assist our efforts to comply with Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  During the first quarter of 2006, we implemented additional processes and procedures and have effected a reorganization of our accounting and finance department in an effort to
assure adequate review of complex, non-routine transactions.  We retained a specialized consultant to assist in our accounting for employee stock based compensation under SFAS 123R.  Management has identified additional steps necessary to address the material
weakness described above. These measures include the implementation of requirements for more stringent and complex documentation regarding the analysis of complex, non-routine transactions and the proposed accounting treatment by accounting
personnel and the chief financial officer. We will implement policies and procedures to assure adequate and timely involvement of outside accounting contractors, as needed, to obtain guidance as to the application of generally accepted accounting
principles to complex, non-routine transactions. We will continue to implement policies, processes and procedures regarding the review of complex, non-routine transactions and plan to hire additional accounting personnel. We believe that the steps
identified will improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.  Other than as described above, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.  Item9B.
