The Board of Directors and Shareholders
MetaSolv, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MetaSolv, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001, and 2000, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income, and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2001. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we
also have audited the related financial statement schedule. These consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MetaSolv, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2001 the
Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and certain provisions of SFAS No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as required for goodwill and intangible
assets resulting from business combinations consummated after June 30, 2001. KPMG LLP

-37          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999
1  Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
MetaSolv, Inc. the Company, a Delaware corporation headquartered in
Plano, Texas, is a provider of software designed to automate the management of
communications networks. Communications service providers using our software are
able to efficiently enter, manage and fulfill orders for service from their
customers. These communications service providers offer a full array of
communications services including local and long distance telephone services,
high-speed data services and Internet services, often as a bundled offering. The
Company derives substantially all of its revenue from the sale of licenses,
related professional services, maintenance and support of packaged software
products to convergent communications service providers and, in 2001, began
offering the products and services to large enterprises that need to manage
their significant internal networks and interfaces to their external service
providers.
a Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of
MetaSolv, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
b Revenue Recognition
The Company software products are licensed to customers primarily through
the direct sales force. The Company software licensing arrangements typically
include multiple elements, such as software products, post-contract customer
support, consulting, and training. On January 1, 2000, the Company adopted the
residual method of revenue recognition for these arrangements. Under the
residual method, the aggregate arrangement fee is allocated to each of the
undelivered elements in an amount equal to their fair value, with the residual
of the arrangement fee allocated to the delivered elements. Fair values are
based upon vendor specific objective evidence. Fees allocated to each software
element of the arrangement are recognized as revenue when the following criteria
have been met: a a written contract for the license of software has been
executed, b the product has been delivered to the customer, c the license
fee is fixed or determinable, and d collectibility of the resulting receivable
is deemed probable. If evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements of the
arrangement does not exist, all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until
such time that evidence of fair value does exist, or until all elements of the
arrangement are delivered. Fees allocated to post-contract customer support are
recognized as revenue ratably over the support period. Fees allocated to other
services are recognized as revenue as the service is performed. The adoption of
this method of revenue recognition did not have a material impact on the
Company financial position or results of operation.
The Company is frequently engaged to provide consulting and implementation
services in connection with the licensing of its software. In situations where
such services include significant modification or customization of the software
or are otherwise essential to the functionality of the software, revenues
relating to the software license and services are aggregated and the combined
revenues are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. Revenue
earned using the percentage-of-completion method is based on management
estimate of progress towards completion. Changes to estimates of progress
towards completion, if any, are accounted for as a change in estimate in the
period of the change. Of total deferred revenues, $151,000 and $2,801,000 as of
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, represented billings in excess of
costs and related profits on certain contracts accounted for under the
percentage-of-completion method. Of total unbilled receivables, $1,204,000 as of
December 31, 2000, represented costs and related profits in excess of billings
on contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method.
Accounts receivable include only those amounts due from customers for which
revenue has been recognized. Deferred revenue includes amounts received from
customers for which revenue has not been recognized.                    -38   c Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of investments in an interest-bearing money market
account and commercial paper with maturities of three months or less. For
purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date
of purchase to be cash equivalents.
d Marketable Securities and Equity Investments
Marketable securities at December 31, 2001 consist of $26,200,000 of
commercial paper with remaining contractual maturities of 60 days or less, debt
securities issued by U.S. government agencies of $24,600,000 with remaining
contractual maturities of 12 months or less and $6,100,000 of corporate bonds.
Marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair
value. Unrealized gains were $123,000 at December 31, 2001.
The Company uses the cost method to account for its investments in equity
securities. A decline in the market value of any investment deemed to be other
than temporary is charged to earnings. During 2001, the Company recorded an
impairment charge of $3,429,000 for other than temporary declines in the value
of its investments.
e Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, for
leasehold improvements, the term of the lease, if shorter. The estimated useful
lives are as follows                           Years
Furniture and fixtures          7
Computer equipment            3
Leasehold improvements        3-11
Other equipment            3-7
f Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short
maturities.
g Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of
technological feasibility of the product are expensed as incurred. After
technological feasibility is established, any additional software development
costs are capitalized. The Company believes its process for developing software
is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological
feasibility and, accordingly, no software development costs have been
capitalized to date.
In connection with the acquisition of Lat45 Information Systems Inc., the
Company recorded a charge of $2,940,000 for acquired in-process research and
development. At the date of the acquisition, the in-process research and
development projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative future uses. The projects generally included enhancements and
upgrades to existing technology, enhanced communication among systems,
introduction of new functionality and the development of new technology
primarily for integration purposes. The value of the in-process research and
development was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis of the
anticipated income stream of the related product sales. The projected net cash
flows were computed using a discount rate of 35% for the in-process research and
development projects. It is anticipated that remaining costs to complete the
projects will be approximately $1,400,000 and project release dates will range
from the fall 2002 through spring 2003. If these projects are not successfully
developed, future revenues and profitability may be adversely affected, and the
value of intangible assets acquired may become impaired.                    -39   h Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected
to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairments to be recognized are measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed
of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to
sell.
i Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the amounts of existing assets
and liabilities recorded for financial reporting purposes and their respective
tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is reflected in income tax expense in the period that
includes the enactment date.
j Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
k Stock Option Plan
The Company applies the intrinsic value-based method of accounting
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations, in accounting for its
fixed plan stock options. As such, compensation expense is recorded only if the
fair value of the underlying stock exceeded its exercise price on the date of
grant.
l Comprehensive Income
The Company reports comprehensive income in its consolidated statement of
stockholders' equity. Comprehensive income represents changes in stockholders'
equity from non-owner sources. For the three years ended December 31, 2001,
unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities and foreign currency
translations were the only items of other comprehensive income for the Company.
The unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities for the year ended
December 31, 2001 were $123,000. The foreign currency translation amount for the
year ended December 31, 2001 was $2,000.
m Foreign Currency Translations
For all significant non-U.S. operations, the functional currency is the
local currency. Assets and liabilities of those operations are translated into
U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates; income and expenses are translated
using the average exchange rates for the reporting period. Translation
adjustments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate
component of stockholders' equity.
n Earnings Per Share of Common Stock
Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income or loss available
to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the
incremental increase in common shares outstanding assuming the exercise of all
stock options and conversion of all preferred stock that would have had a
dilutive effect on earnings per share.                    -40   o Stock Split
On October 28, 1999, the Company consummated a 2 for 1 split of all classes
of its common and preferred stock. The financial statements have been adjusted
to give retroactive effect to the stock split.
p Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2000 and 1999 consolidated
financial statements to conform to the 2001 presentation.
q Accounting Change
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141,
Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
SFAS No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used and
establishes new standards for the recognition of certain identifiable intangible
assets, separate from goodwill, for all business combinations initiated after
June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 will require that goodwill and intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead tested for
impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142 will also require that intangible
assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated
useful lives to their estimated residual values.
The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 141 effective July 1, 2001
and will fully adopt SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. In accordance with
the transition provisions of SFAS No. 142, goodwill acquired in purchase
business combinations completed after June 30, 2001 is not amortized, but is
evaluated for impairment in accordance with the accounting literature in effect
prior to the issuance of SFAS No. 142. The Company goodwill balance of
approximately $6,375,000 is not being amortized as it all relates to
acquisitions completed subsequent to June 30, 2001 see Note 11.

Total expense..  $ 2,244   $ 10,004   $ 1,815
During 2001, 2000, and 1999 income before income taxes included
approximately $27,000, $451,000, and $23,000, respectively, of non-U.S. income.
Income tax expense benefit differed from the amounts computed by applying the
U.S. federal income tax rate of 35 percent to income before taxes in the years
ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, and 34 percent in the year ended December 31,
1999, as follows in thousands                                           December 31,

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant
portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below in
thousands                                        December 31,

Total deferred tax liabilities..      1,711    275
Net deferred tax asset       $3,866    $3,649
The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary
differences become deductible. Based upon the level of historical taxable income
and projections for future taxable income over the periods during which the
deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than
not the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.
The Company has aggregate non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards of approximately
$5,200,000 which expire through the year 2008.
-42 4  Accrued Expenses
Accrued expenses consist of the following in thousands                                        December 31,

$13,679    $16,468 5  Convertible Preferred Stock and Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
In 1996, the Company issued 6,458,480 shares of Class B redeemable
convertible preferred stock for net cash proceeds of $2,475,000. In 1997, the
Company issued 279,680 additional shares of Class B redeemable convertible
preferred stock for cash proceeds of $110,000. In 1998, the Company issued
2,857,146 shares of Class C redeemable convertible preferred stock for cash
proceeds of $10,000,000. In November 1999, effective with the Company initial
public offering, each share of outstanding convertible preferred stock and
redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted to one share of common
stock. These share amounts have been adjusted for stock splits in June 1998 and
October 1999.
6  Stock Option Plan and Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company has adopted the MetaSolv, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan
pursuant to which the Board of Directors may grant stock options to officers and
employees. The plan at its adoption authorized grants of options to purchase up
to 9,320,000 shares of authorized but unissued common stock. The number of
shares issuable under the plan increases by 5% of the Company outstanding
common stock as of January 1 of each of the first five calendar years following
adoption of the plan. Accordingly, as of January 1, 2002, the number of shares
authorized under the plan increased to 14,711,666. At December 31, 2001, there
were 2,153,589 additional shares available for grant under the plan.
Generally, stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the
stock fair market value at the date of grant. All options have terms of ten
years or less, and most options vest in four or five equal cumulative
installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. The per share
weighted-average fair value of stock options granted for the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $709, $2113 and $099, respectively, as
estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
assumptions: expected dividend yield of 0%, risk-free interest rate of 42% for
2001 and 6% for years 2000 and 1999, an expected life of five years, and
volatility of 107% for 2001, 80% for 2000 and 0% for 1999.
The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for stock options
granted to employees and non-employee directors under its stock option plans.
The Company recorded deferred compensation of $150,000 in 2001 and $656,000 in
1999 as a result of granting stock options with exercise prices below the
estimated fair value per share of the Company common stock at the date of
grant. Deferred compensation has been recorded as a component of stockholders'
equity and is being amortized as a charge to operations over the vesting period
of the applicable options. Amortization of deferred compensation was $296,000 256,000 and $100,000 in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.
Had the Company determined compensation cost based on the fair value at the
grant date for its stock options and activity under the Employee Stock Purchase
Plan under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, the Company
net income loss would have been changed to the pro forma amounts indicated
below in thousands, except per share data                    -43                                   Year ended December 31,
2001    2000     1999
Net income loss:
As reported      $  2,717  $ 16,043  $  2,645
Pro forma      $ 3,875 $ 10,921  $  2,194
Earnings loss per share of common stock:
Basic:
As reported      $  007  $  045  $  017
Pro forma      $  011 $  031  $  014
Diluted:
As reported      $  007  $  040  $  008
Pro forma      $  011 $  027  $  007
Pro forma net income loss reflects only stock options granted after
December 31, 1995. Therefore, the full impact of calculating compensation cost
for stock options under SFAS No. 123 is not reflected in the pro forma amounts
presented above because compensation cost is reflected over the options' vesting
periods of five years and compensation expense pertaining to stock options
granted in prior periods is not considered.
Stock option activity during the periods indicated is as follows                                                  Weighted-

options were vested and exercisable at a weighted-average exercise price of
$648, $141, and, $056 respectively.
-44   In August 1999, the Company adopted the MetaSolv, Inc. Employee Stock
Purchase Plan. The plan was authorized to issue 600,000 shares of authorized and
unissued common stock, and shares issuable under the plan increase annually
during the first five years following adoption of the plan by 1% of the
Company outstanding common stock. Accordingly, as of January 1, 2002, the
number of shares authorized under the plan increased to 1,678,333. The plan
allows employees to purchase common stock at a 15% discount from the lower of
the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning of the enrollment
period or the purchase date. During 2001, there were 313,101 shares of common
stock issued under the plan.
7  401k Plan and Trust Agreement
The Company has a 401k Plan and Trust Agreement under which employees are
entitled to contribute up to 15% of their salary, subject to certain regulatory
limitations. In 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company made profit sharing
contributions of approximately $618,000, $667,000 and $594,000, respectively, to
the plan.

Legal Proceedings
On November 1, 2001, Bernstein Liebhard & Lifshitz, LLP announced that it
had filed a class action suit in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York against MetaSolv Software, Inc., Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, Inc., BancBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc., Jeffries & Company,
Inc., James P. Janicki, and Glenn A. Etherington, alleging violations of
Sections 11, and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 and alleging violations of
Section 12a2 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10b of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder against
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Inc., BancBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc., and
Jeffries & Company, Inc. The named plaintiff is Colbert Birnet, L.P. The
complaint seeks unspecified damages as a result of various alleged securities
law violations arising from activities purportedly engaged in by the
underwriters in connection with our initial public offering. The plaintiffs
allege that the underwriter defendants agreed to allocate stock in our initial
public offering to certain investors in exchange for excessive and undisclosed
commissions and agreements by those investors to make additional purchases of
stock in the aftermarket at pre-determined prices. The plaintiffs allege that
the prospectus for our initial public offering was false and misleading in
violation of the securities laws because it did not disclose these arrangements.
The Company believes that the suit is without merit and that the Company
and its officers have fully complied with applicable laws and regulations. The
Company does not expect this action will impact its operations or financial
results.                    -45   Letter of Credit

10 Segment Information and Concentration of Credit Risk
SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information, establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises
report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and
requires those enterprises to report selected information about operating
segments in interim financial reports issued to stockholders. The method for
determining what information to report is based on the way management organizes
the operating segments within the Company for making operating decisions and
assessing financial performance.
The Company chief operating decision-maker is considered to be the Chief
Operating Officer COO. The COO reviews financial information presented on a
Company-wide basis accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by
product and service line for purposes of making operating decisions and
assessing financial performance. The financial information reviewed by the COO
is identical to the information presented in the accompanying statements of
operations. Therefore, the Company operates in a single operating segment:
communications software and related services.
Revenue information regarding operations for different products and
services is as follows in thousands                    -46                                         Year ended December 31,

Revenues:
Software license       $ 68,412  $ 71,632  $ 38,788
Professional        15,509    33,995    23,710
Post-contract customer        34,925    26,250    10,509
Total       $ 118,846  $ 131,877  $ 73,007
The Company has derived most of its revenues from the United States. Total
revenue derived from non-U.S. locations was approximately $26,922,000 12,156,000, and $2,522,000 in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. Outside of
the U.S., no individual country accounted for more than 10% of total revenues.
The Company licenses its communications software products to a broad range
of communication service providers. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers' financial condition but does not require
collateral or other security to support its trade accounts receivable. During
1999 one customer represented 13% of total revenues.
11 Acquisitions
On July 20, 2001, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary MetaSolv
Canada Holdings Inc., acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of
Montreal based Lat45 Information Systems Inc., a developer of geospatial
software for planning, design and management of communications networks. The
aggregate purchase price consisted of $6,195,000 in cash excluding acquisition
costs of $600,000 and 366,666 exchangeable shares of MetaSolv Canada Holdings
Inc. valued at $2,805,000. Initially, each of these shares is exchangeable for
one share of MetaSolv, Inc. common stock. In addition, the shareholders of Lat45
Information Systems Inc. were eligible to receive up to an additional $2,000,000
in cash upon the completion of certain revenue milestones prior to December 31,
2001, and the absence of any misrepresentation or breach of warranty within one
year from the closing of the acquisition. These revenue milestones were not
achieved.
The acquisition of Lat45 Information Systems Inc. allows the Company to use
graphical geospatial technology to business and communications network planning
and engineering functions that are key to the customer network planning and
engineering capabilities. This acquisition extends the MetaSolv SolutionTM
product under the brand, MetaSolv Network and Service PlanningTM, both as a
separate product and integrated with the MetaSolv Solution.
The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting
and, accordingly, the results of operations of Lat45 Information Systems Inc.
have been included in the Company consolidated financial statements since July
21, 2001. The purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on an estimate of fair values at the date of
acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net
identifiable assets, totaling $6,375,000 was allocated to goodwill.
Approximately $6,032,000 was allocated to intangible assets, primarily
technology rights, which will be amortized over a three-year period.
Amortization of acquired intangible assets is computed using the greater of
straight-line over the estimated useful life of the asset or the ratio that
current gross revenues for those assets bears to the total current and
anticipated future gross revenues related to those assets. The estimated useful
life of these assets range from nine months to thirty-six months. Approximately
$2,940,000 was allocated to purchased in-process research and development. The
purchased in-process research and development cost was charged to results of
operations in the third quarter. Net obligations assumed upon acquisition were
$5,683,000. Pro forma financial information for this acquisition has not been
presented since the pro forma information would not differ materially from the
historical results of the Company.
12 Restructuring
In the third quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring
charge of $3,142,000. The charge consisted of $1,970,000 for a reduction in
force of approximately 100 people, and approximately $1,172,000 for lease
commitments for certain field offices being closed and related fixed asset
write-downs. The restructuring was in response to lower software license
bookings and the expectation of lower revenues in future periods. The staff
reductions from this program were completed as of December 31, 2001. At December
31, 2001, approximately $1,006,000 is included in accrued liabilities, related
primarily to future minimum lease commitments which expire in 2004. The
following table summarizes the status of the restructuring in thousands                    -47                                  Year ended December 31, 2001

13 Subsequent Events
On February 1, 2002, we acquired certain OSS assets from Nortel Networks.
With this acquisition, we extended our product portfolio with a leading
carrier-class highly scalable and reliable service activation product, and
several point solutions that allow communications service providers to
efficiently manage and deliver differentiated services for Internet Protocol
IP, data, and wireless communications. As a result of the acquisition, we now
offer a comprehensive suite of OSS solutions available for wireless, IP, data,
and traditional networks and services. The acquisition also strengthens the
worldwide scope of our product sales and services through an established
presence in Europe.
This acquisition will be accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly, the results of the business acquired will be
included in the Company consolidated financial statements beginning February
2, 2002. The purchase price of $35,000,000 cash and the assumption of certain
liabilities which are estimated at $8,500,000 will be allocated to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based on an estimate of fair values at the date
of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net
identifiable assets, when determined, will be allocated to goodwill. The value
assigned to intangible assets, primarily technology rights, will be amortized
over the estimated useful life of the assets using the greater of straight-line
or the ratio that current gross revenues related to those assets bears to the
total current and anticipated future gross revenues related to those assets. The
value to be allocated to purchased in-process research and development will be
charged to earnings in the first quarter of 2002.
