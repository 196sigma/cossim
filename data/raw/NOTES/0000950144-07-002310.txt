41 Table of Contents   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   The Board of Directors and Stockholders   The Ultimate Software Group, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company as of December31, 2006 and 2005 and
the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss, and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2006. These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company and subsidiaries as of December31,
2006 and 2005 and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2006, in conformity with U.S.generally
accepted accounting principles.   As discussed in Notes2 and 12 to the consolidated
financial statements, effective January1, 2006, the
Company adopted the provision of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No123 revised 2004, Share-Based
Payment.   Also, as discussed in Notes2 and 4 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company changed its method of
quantifying errors in 2006.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report
dated March16, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of, and the effective operation of,
internal control over financial reporting.

NATURE OF
OPERATIONS   The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. Ultimate Software
or the Company designs, markets, implements and
supports payroll and talent management solutions, marketed
primarily to middle-market organizations with 200 to 15,000
employees. The Company reaches its customer base and target
market through its direct sales force and a network of national,
regional and local strategic partners.

SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Basis of
Consolidation   The consolidated financial statements reflect the financial
position and operating results of the Company which include
wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.   Use of
Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.   Reclassifications   As a result of implementing Staff Accounting
BulletinNo108 in 2006, the Company reclassified
$426 thousand from accrued expenses to long term deferred rent
to conform to the 2006 presentation. See Note4 for further
discussion.   Staff
Accounting BulletinNo108   In September 2006, the SEC released Staff Accounting
BulletinNo108, Considering the Effects of
Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
Current Year Financial Statements
SAB108. SAB108 addresses how the
effects of prior-year uncorrected misstatements should be
considered when quantifying misstatements in current-year
financial statements. SAB108 requires an entity to
quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income
statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach
results in quantifying an error that is material in light of
relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. During the fourth
quarter of 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of
SAB108. See Note4 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion.   Fair
Value of a Conditional Asset Retirement Obligation   The Company adopted FASB Interpretation FIN No47,
Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligation, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No143, effective
December31, 2005. FIN47 requires an entity to
recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset
retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair
value can be reasonably estimated. The adoption of FIN47
did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated
financial statements.   Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   The Companys financial instruments, consisting of cash and
cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, long-term debt and capital lease
obligations, approximated fair value as of December31,
2006 and 2005.   
47 Table of Contents   Cash and
Cash Equivalents   All highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three
months or less when acquired are considered cash equivalents and
are comprised of interest-bearing accounts.   Accounts
Receivable   Accounts receivable are principally from end-users of the
Companys products. The Company performs credit evaluations
of its customers and has recorded allowances for estimated
losses. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts
at an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate
protection against losses resulting from collecting less than
full payment on accounts receivables. A considerable amount of
judgment is required when the realization of receivables is
assessed, including assessing the probability of collection and
current credit-worthiness of each customer. If the financial
condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate,
resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, an
additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required.   Investments
in Marketable Securities   The Company classifies its investments in marketable securities
with readily determinable fair values as securities
available-for-sale
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities FAS115 and FASB
Staff Position Financial Accounting Standards
No115-1,
The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments
FSP
FAS115-1.
The Company has classified all investments as
available-for-sale.
Available-for-sale
securities consist of debt and equity securities not classified
as trading securities nor as securities to be held to maturity.
Unrealized holding gains and losses on securities
available-for-sale
are reported as a net amount in accumulated other comprehensive
loss in stockholders equity until realized. Gains and
losses on the sale of securities
available-for-sale
are determined using the specific identification method.
Included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the end of
2006 and 2005 are an unrealized gain of $2 thousand and an
unrealized loss of $31 thousand, respectively, of unrealized
losses on trading securities held at each year end.   The amortized cost and market value of the Companys
investments in
available-for-sale
securities at December31, 2006 are shown in the table

48 Table of Contents   Property
and Equipment   Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment is
depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, which range from two to twenty
years. Leasehold improvements and assets under capital leases
are amortized over the shorter of the life of the asset or the
term of the lease over periods ranging from two to fifteen
years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when
incurred; betterments are capitalized. Upon the sale or
retirement of assets, the cost, accumulated depreciation and
amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss
is recognized.   Property and equipment consists of the following in thousands

27,693   22,427     13,480     10,026   Rental
Costs Incurred during a Construction Period   Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted FSP
FAS13-1,
Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction
Period, which addresses the accounting for rental costs
associated with operating leases that are incurred during a
construction period. Rental costs incurred during and after a
construction period are for the right to control the use of a
leased asset during and after construction of a leased asset.
Since there is no distinction between the right to use a leased
asset during the construction period and the right to use that
asset after the construction period, rental costs associated
with ground or building operating leases that are incurred
during a construction period shall be recognized as rental
expense on a straight-line basis. The adoption of FSP
FAS13-1
did not have a material impact on the Companys
consolidated financial statements.   Long-Lived
Assets   On January1, 2002, the Company adopted
SFASNo144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,
SFASNo144. The Company evaluates the
carrying value of long-lived assets, when indicators of
impairment exist. For the year ended December31, 2006, no
such events or circumstances were identified. The carrying value
of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the
undiscounted expected future cash flows from such asset or
asset group are separately identifiable and less than the
assets or asset groups carrying value. In that
event, a loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying
value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value
is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows
discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. For
the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the
Company made no material adjustments to its long-lived assets.   Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets   Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are
not subject to amortization, but are subject to an impairment
test at least annually or more frequently if events or
circumstances indicate that impairment might exist. The Company
completed its annual impairment analysis of goodwill in the
fourth quarter of 2006 and determined goodwill had not been
impaired as of December31, 2006. SFASNo142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
SFASNo142, also requires that
intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their
estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance
with SFASNo144. The Company is currently amortizing
its acquired intangible assets with finite lives over periods
ranging from one to six years.

Intersourcing arrangements is assigned to each element based on
the guidance provided by EITF
No00-21.   The elements that typically exist in Intersourcing arrangements
include hosting services, the right to use UltiPro, maintenance
of UltiPro i.e., product enhancements and customer support and
professional services i.e., implementation services and
training in the use of UltiPro. The pricing for Hosting
Services, the right to use UltiPro and maintenance of UltiPro is
bundled the Bundled Elements. Since these three
Bundled Elements are components of recurring revenues in the
consolidated statements of operations, allocation of fair values
to each of the three elements is not necessary and they are not
reported separately. Fair value for the Bundled Elements, as a
whole, is based upon evidence provided by the Companys
pricing for Intersourcing arrangements sold separately. The
Bundled Elements are provided on an ongoing basis and represent
undelivered elements under EITF
No00-21;
they are recognized on a monthly basis as the services are
performed, once the customer processes its first live payroll
i.e., goes Live.   Implementation and training services the Professional
Services provided for Intersourcing arrangements are
typically priced on a time and materials basis and are
recognized as services revenue in the consolidated statements of
operations as the services are performed. Under EITF
00-21, fair
value is assigned to service elements in the arrangement based
on their relative fair values, using the prices established when
the services are sold on a stand-alone basis. Fair value for
Professional Services is based on the respective Implementation
Valuation and Training Valuation. If evidence of the fair value
of one or more undelivered elements does not exist, the revenue
is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements
occurs or when fair value can be established.   The Company believes that applying EITF
00-21 to
Intersourcing arrangements as opposed to applying
SOP97-2
is appropriate given the nature of the arrangements whereby the
customer has no right to the UltiPro license.   
50 Table of Contents   Sales of
Base Hosting Services   Subscription revenues generated from Base Hosting are recognized
in accordance with EITF
No00-3,
Application of AICPA Statement of Position
97-2 to
Arrangements that Include the Right to Use Software Stored on
Another Entitys Hardware, which provides guidance as
to the application of
SOP97-2
to hosting arrangements that include a license right to the
software. The elements that typically exist for Base Hosting
arrangements include hosting services and implementation
services. Base Hosting is different than Intersourcing
arrangements in that the customer already owns a perpetual
license or is purchasing a perpetual license for UltiPro and is
purchasing hosting services subsequently in a separate
transaction, whereas with Intersourcing the customer is
purchasing the right to use not license UltiPro.
Implementation services provided for Base Hosting arrangements
are substantially less than those provided for Intersourcing
arrangements since UltiPro is already implemented in Base
Hosting arrangements and only needs to be transitioned to a
hosted environment. Fair value for hosting services is based on
the Hosting Valuation. The fair value for implementation
services is based on the Implementation Valuation in accordance
with guidelines provided by
SOP97-2.   Recurring
Revenues   Recurring revenues include maintenance revenues and subscription
revenues. Maintenance revenues are derived from maintaining,
supporting and providing periodic updates for the Companys
software. Subscription revenues are principally derived from
PEPM fees earned through the Intersourcing Offering, Base
Hosting and the BSP sales channel, as well as revenues generated
from the Original Ceridian Agreement. Maintenance revenues are
recognized ratably over the service period, generally one year.
Maintenance and support fees are generally priced as a
percentage of the initial license fee for the underlying
products.   To the extent there are upfront fees associated with the
Intersourcing Offering, Base Hosting or the BSP sales channel,
subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the minimum
term of the related contract upon the delivery of the product
and services. In the cases of Intersourcing and Base Hosting
sales, amortization of the upfront fees commences when the
customer processes its first Live payroll, which typically
occurs four to six months after the sale, and extends until the
end of the initial contract period. In the case of BSP channel
sales, amortization of the upfront fee typically commences when
the contract is signed, which is when the BSPs rights
under the agreement begin, continuing until the initial contract
term ends. Ongoing PEPM fees from the Intersourcing Offering,
Base Hosting and the BSP sales channel are recognized as
subscription revenue as the services are delivered, typically on
a monthly basis.   Commencing on August28, 2002, subscription revenues
generated from the Original Ceridian Agreement have been
recognized ratably over the minimum term of the contract, which
extends until March9, 2008 7years from the
effective date of the Original Ceridian Agreement. Subscription
revenues of $642,000per month are based on guaranteed
minimum payments from Ceridian of approximately
$427million over the minimum contract term, including
$354million received to date. The amount of subscription
revenue recognized under the Original Ceridian Agreement during
the year ended December31, 2006, totaling
$77million, was the same as that recognized in 2005. The
Company expects to continue to recognize $642,000per month
or $77million per annum as recurring subscription
revenue until March9, 2008 when the Original Ceridian
Agreement terminates.   Maintenance services provided to customers include product
updates and technical support services. Product updates are
included in general releases to the Companys customers and
are distributed on a periodic basis. Such updates may include,
but are not limited to, product enhancements, payroll tax
updates, additional security features or bug fixes. All features
provided in general releases are unspecified upgrade rights. To
the extent specified upgrade rights or entitlements to future
products are included in a multi-element arrangement, revenue is
recognized upon delivery provided fair value for the elements
exists. In multi-element arrangements that include a specified
upgrade right or entitlement to a future product, if fair value
does not exist for all undelivered elements, revenue for the
entire arrangement is deferred until all elements are delivered
or when fair value can be established.   
51 Table of Contents   Subscription revenues generated from the BSP sales channel
include both the right to use UltiPro and maintenance. The BSP
is charged a fee on a PEPM basis. Revenue is recognized on a
PEPM basis. To the extent the BSP pays the Company a one-time
upfront fee, the Company accounts for such fee by recognizing it
as subscription revenue over the minimum term of the related
agreement.   Perpetual
Licenses for UltiPro Sold With or Without Hosting
Services   Sales of perpetual licenses for UltiPro and sales of perpetual
licenses for UltiPro in conjunction with Hosting Services are
multiple-element arrangements that involve the sale of software
and consequently fall under the guidance of Statement of
Position SOP
97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, for revenue
recognition.   The Company licenses software under non-cancelable license
agreements and provides services including maintenance,
implementation consulting and training services. In accordance
with the provisions of
SOP97-2,
license revenues are generally recognized when 1a
non-cancelable license agreement has been signed by both
parties, 2the product has been shipped, 3no
significant vendor obligations remain and 4collection of
the related receivable is considered probable. To the extent any
one of these four criteria is not satisfied, license revenue is
deferred and not recognized in the consolidated statements of
operations until all such criteria are met.   For multiple-element software arrangements, each element of the
arrangement is analyzed and the Company allocates a portion of
the total fee under the arrangement to the elements based on
vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value of the element
VSOE, regardless of any separate prices stated
within the contract for each element. Fair value is considered
the price a customer would be required to pay when the element
is sold separately.   The Residual Method as defined below is used to recognize
revenue when a license agreement includes one or more elements
to be delivered at a future date and VSOE of the fair value of
all undelivered elements exists. The fair value of the
undelivered elements is determined based on the historical
evidence of stand-alone sales of these elements to customers.
Undelivered elements in a license arrangement typically include
maintenance, implementation and training services the
Standard Undelivered Elements. The fair value for
maintenance fees is based on the price of the services sold
separately, which is determined by the annual renewal rate
historically and consistently charged to customers the
Maintenance Valuation. Maintenance fees are
generally priced as a percentage of the related license fee. The
fair value for implementation services is based on standard
pricing i.e., rate per hour charged to customers for
implementation services, for stand-alone sales of
implementation services the Implementation
Valuation. The fair value for training services is based
on standard pricing i.e., rate per training day charged to
customers for class attendance, taking into consideration
stand-alone sales of training services through year-end seminars
and historically consistent pricing for such services the
Training Valuation. Under the residual method the
Residual Method, the fair value of the undelivered
elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the
arrangement fee attributable to the delivered element, the
license fee, is recognized as license revenue. If VSOE for one
or more undelivered elements does not exist, the revenue is
deferred on the entire arrangement until the earlier of the
point at which isuch VSOE does exist or iiall
elements of the arrangement have been delivered.   Perpetual licenses of UltiPro sold without Hosting Services
typically include a license fee and the Standard Undelivered
Elements. Fair value for the Standard Undelivered Elements is
based on the Maintenance Valuation, the Implementation Valuation
and the Training Valuation. The delivered element of the
arrangement, the license fee, is accounted for in accordance
with the Residual Method.   Perpetual licenses of UltiPro sold with Hosting Services
typically include a license fee, the Standard Undelivered
Elements and Hosting Services. Fair value for the Standard
Undelivered Elements is based on the Maintenance Valuation, the
Training Valuation and the Implementation Valuation. Hosting
Services are delivered to customers on a PEPM basis over the
term of the related customer contract Hosting PEPM
Services. Upfront fees charged to customers represent
fees for the hosting infrastructure, including hardware costs,
third-party license fees and other upfront costs incurred by the
Company in relation to providing such   
52 Table of Contents   services Hosting Upfront Fees. Hosting PEPM
Services and Hosting Upfront Fees collectively, Hosting
Services represent undelivered elements in the
arrangement since their delivery is over the course of the
related contract term. The fair value for Hosting Services is
based on standard pricing i.e., rate charged PEPM, taking into
consideration stand-alone sales of Hosting Services through the
sale of such services to existing customers i.e., those who
already own the UltiPro perpetual license at the time Hosting
Services are sold to them and historically consistent pricing
for such services the Hosting Valuation. The
delivered element of the arrangement, the license fee, is
accounted for in accordance with the Residual Method.   The Companys customer contracts are non-cancelable
agreements. The Company does not provide for rights of return or
price protection on its software. The Company provides a limited
warranty that its software will perform in accordance with user
manuals for varying periods, which are generally less than one
year from the contract date. The Companys customer
contracts generally do not include conditions of acceptance.
However, if conditions of acceptance are included in a contract
or uncertainty exists about customer acceptance of the software,
license revenue is deferred until acceptance occurs.   Services,
including Implementation and Training Services   Services revenues include revenues from fees charged for the
implementation of the Companys software products and
training of customers in the use of such products, fees for
other services, including services provided to BSPs, the
provision of payroll-related forms and the printing of
FormW-2s
for certain customers, as well as certain reimbursable
out-of-pocket
expenses. Revenues for implementation consulting and training
services are recognized as services are performed to the extent
the pricing for such services is on a time and materials basis
and the payment terms are within the Companys ordinary and
customary payment cycle. In the event payments for services are
outside the ordinary and customary period for the Company, the
related revenues are recognized as payments come due based on
their relative fair values. Other services are recognized as the
product is shipped or as the services are rendered depending on
the specific terms of the arrangement.   Arrangement fees related to fixed-fee implementation services
contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion
accounting method, which involves the use of estimates.
Percentage of completion is measured at each reporting date
based on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated
hours to complete. If a sufficient basis to measure the progress
towards completion does not exist, revenue is recognized when
the project is completed or when the Company receives final
acceptance from the customer.   The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Securities
Exchange Commission SEC Staff Accounting
BulletinNo101, Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements SABNo101
and the SEC Staff Accounting BulletinNo104,
Revenue Recognition
SABNo104. Management believes the
Company is currently in compliance in all material aspects with
the current provisions set forth in
SOP97-2,
SOP98-9,
EITF 00-21,
EITF 00-3,
SABNo101 and SABNo104.   Concentration
of Revenues   During the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
Ceridian Corporation Ceridian accounted for 67   87%, 155%, respectively, of total revenues. No other customer
accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in the periods
presented. Due to the significant concentration of total
revenues with this single customer, the Company has exposure if
this customer loses its credit worthiness. See Note5.   The decrease in the percentage of total revenues contributed by
Ceridian in 2006 and 2005 resulted from the expiration of the
Ceridian Services Agreement on December31, 2004, combined
with the fixed nature of the recurring revenues recognized
pursuant to the Original Ceridian Agreement. As total revenues
have increased each year, on a
year-over-year
basis, particularly with respect to the recurring revenues
growth, the fixed amount of recurring revenues recognized each
year from the Original Ceridian Agreement diminishes in its
overall contribution and, therefore, continues to become less
significant to the amount of the Companys total revenues.
The Company anticipates a continued reduction in the percentage
of total revenues contributed by Ceridian, as fixed recurring
revenues under the Original Ceridian Agreement of
$642,000per month will be recognized until the termination
of the Original Ceridian Agreement on March9, 2008.   
53 Table of Contents   The composition of the revenues recognized from Ceridian, as a
percentage of total revenues, for the years ended
December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was as follows   	
2006   2005   2004   Recurring revenues
67     87     109     Services revenues
46   Total revenues
67     87     155     Deferred
Revenue   Deferred revenue is primarily comprised of deferrals for
recurring revenues for Intersourcing services which are
recognized over the term of the related contract as the services
are performed, typically two years, maintenance services which
have not yet been rendered, implementation consulting services
for which the services have not yet been rendered, and
subscription revenues which are recognized ratably over the
minimum term of the related contract upon the delivery of the
product and services.   In accordance with EITF
01-3,
Accounting in a Purchase Business Combination for Deferred
Revenue of an Acquiree, the deferred maintenance revenue
liability assumed in the acquisition of RTIX was adjusted to
fair value, which is the sum of direct and incremental costs of
fulfilling the maintenance obligation plus a normal profit
margin on those fulfillment costs. As a result of the adjustment
to fair value, a $01million decrease in the deferred
revenues liability assumed in the acquisition of RTIX was
recorded in the Companys consolidated financial
statements, which will be recognized entirely within
approximately a nine-month period following the acquisition date
of October5, 2006.   Cost of
Revenues   Cost of revenues consists of the cost of recurring, services and
license revenues. Cost of recurring revenues consists of costs
to provide maintenance and technical support to the
Companys customers, the cost of providing periodic updates
and the cost of subscription revenues, including amortization of
capitalized software. Cost of services revenues primarily
consists of costs to provide implementation services and
training to the Companys customers and, to a lesser
degree, costs related to sales of payroll-related forms, costs
associated with certain reimbursable
out-of-pocket
expenses, discussed below, and costs to support additional
services provided to BSPs or BSP services. Cost of license
revenues primarily consists of fees payable to third-parties for
software products distributed by the Company. UltiPro includes
third-party software for enhanced report writing purposes and
for time and attendance functionality. When UltiPro licenses are
sold, customers pay the Company on a per user basis for the
license rights to the third-party report writing software and
for the add-on product, UltiPro Time and Attendance, which was
introduced in 2006.   Income
Taxes   The Company is subject to corporate Federal and state income
taxes and accounts for income taxes under the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
SFASNo109 provides for a liability approach under
which deferred income taxes are provided based upon enacted tax
laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the taxes
become payable.   Foreign
Currency   The financial statements of the Companys foreign
subsidiaries have been translated into U.S.dollars. The
functional currency of The Ultimate Software Group of Canada,
Inc. is the Canadian dollar and the functional currency of The
Ultimate Software Group UK Limited is the British pound. Assets
and liabilities are translated into U.S.dollars at
period-end exchange rates, while fixed assets and equity
accounts are translated at historical rates. Income and expenses
are translated at the average exchange rate for the reporting
period. The resulting translation adjustments, representing
unrealized gains or losses, are included in stockholders
equity as a component of comprehensive net income. Realized
gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions
are included in total operating costs in the statements of
operations. The   
54 Table of Contents   Company had a $1 thousand unrealized loss for the year ended
December31, 2006. There were no foreign currency
transactions during 2005 or 2004.   Software
Development Costs   SFASNo86, Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
Marketed, requires capitalization of certain software
development costs subsequent to the establishment of
technological feasibility. Based on the Companys product
development process, technological feasibility is established
upon completion of a working model. During 2006 and 2005,
$18million and $02million, respectively, of
research and development expenses were capitalized for the
development of UltiPro Canadian HR/payroll UltiPro
Canada functionality.   UltiPro Canada is being built from the existing product
infrastructure of UltiPro e.g., using UltiPros source
code and architecture. UltiPro Canada provides HR/payroll
functionality which includes the availability of Canadian tax
rules, as well as Canadian human resources functionality, taking
into consideration labor laws in Canada and including changes to
the language where necessary i.e., English to French. There
was no software costs capitalized in 2004.   Annual amortization is based on the greater of the amount
computed using athe ratio that current gross revenues
for the related product bears to the total of current and
anticipated future gross revenues for that product or
bthe straight-line method over the remaining estimated
economic life of the product including the period being reported
on.   Capitalized software is amortized using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are
typically three years. Amortization of capitalized software was
$26,000, $86,000 and $1,151,000 in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Accumulated amortization of capitalized software
was $56million, $56million and $55million
as of December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Capitalized software, net of amortization, was
$21million, $02million and $01million as of
December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.   The Company evaluates the recoverability of capitalized software
based on estimated future gross revenues reduced by the
estimated costs of completing the products and of performing
maintenance and customer support. If the Companys gross
revenues were to be significantly less than its estimates, the
net realizable value of the Companys capitalized software
intended for sale would be impaired, which could result in the
write-off of all or a portion of the unamortized balance of such
capitalized software.   Stock-Based
Compensation   Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted the
provisions of SFASNo123 revised 2004,
Share-Based Payment
SFASNo123R, using the modified
prospective method with the Black-Scholes fair value model,
which requires the Company to recognize expense related to the
fair value of stock-based compensation awards. Under the
modified prospective method, stock-based compensation expense
for the year ended December31, 2006 includes compensation
expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted prior
to, but not yet vested as of, January1, 2006, based on
grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
provisions of SFASNo123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation
SFASNo123, and compensation expense
for all stock-based compensation awards granted subsequent to
January1, 2006, based on the grant date fair values
estimated in accordance with the provisions of
SFASNo123R. In addition, stock options granted to
certain members of the Board of Directors Board as
payment for services rendered as board members Board
Services recorded in accordance with
SFASNo123R and the issuance of restricted stock
awards and stock units to certain employees are also included in
stock-based compensation for the three and twelve months ended
December31, 2006. Accordingly, prior period amounts
presented herein have not been restated to reflect the adoption
of SFASNo123R.   Prior to January1, 2006, the Company accounted for its
stock-based compensation plan as permitted by
SFASNo123, using the intrinsic value method
prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB
No25, and made the pro forma disclosures required
by   
55 Table of Contents   SFASNo148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure
SFASNo148 for the year ended
December31, 2005. Except for options granted to certain
members of the Board for board services, all options granted
under the Plan and Prior Plan discussed in
Note12had exercise prices equal to the fair market
value of the underlying Common Stock on the date of grant.
Accordingly, for the year ended December31, 2005,
stock-based compensation is related to options granted to
certain members of the Board for board services and the issuance
of restricted stock awards and stock units to certain employees
recorded in accordance with APB No25.   See Note12 for further information on stock based
compensation.   In accordance with SFASNo123R, the Company
capitalizes the portion of stock-based compensation expense
attributed to research and development personnel whose labor
costs are being capitalized pursuant to SFASNo86
for the development of UltiPro Canada. The following table

FASB Staff Position FSP
FAS123R-2,
Practical Accommodation to the Application of Grant Date
as Defined in FASB Statement No123R. This FSP
provides guidance on the application of grant date as defined in
SFAS123R. As a practical accommodation, a mutual
understanding of the key terms and conditions of an award is
approved in accordance with the relevant corporate governance
requirements if certain conditions are met. The adoption of this
FSP did not have a material impact on the Companys
consolidated financial statements.   In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
No.FAS123R-3, Transition Election Related to
Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards
FSP123R-3. The Company has elected to
adopt the alternative transition method provided in the FASB
Staff Position for calculating the tax effects of stock-based
compensation expense pursuant to SFAS123R. The
alternative transition method includes a simplified method to
establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in
capital pool APIC pool related to the tax effects
of employee and director stock-based compensation expense, and
to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and the
consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of
employee and director stock-based awards that were outstanding
upon adoption of SFAS123R. Due to the Companys
history of tax net operating losses, there was no beginning
balance in the APIC pool at the date of adoption of
SFAS123R on January1, 2006.   The Company also adopted FSP
FAS123R-4,
Classification of Options and Similar Instruments Issued
as Employee Compensation That Allow for Cash Settlement upon the
Occurrence of a Contingent Event, during the first quarter
of fiscal year 2006. This FSP addresses the classification of
options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation
that allow for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a
contingent event. This FSP amends FAS123R so that a cash
settlement feature that can be exercised only upon the
occurrence of a contingent event that is outside the
employees control does not meet the condition to classify
as a liability until it becomes probable that the event will
occur. The adoption of this FSP did not have a material impact
on the Companys consolidated financial statements.   Earnings
Per Share   SFASNo128, Earnings Per Share, requires
dual presentation of earnings per share
basic and diluted. Basic earnings per
share is computed by dividing income available to common
stockholders the numerator by the weighted average number of
common shares the denominator for the period. The computation
of diluted earnings per share is similar to basic earnings per
share, except that the denominator is

of SFASNo130 is to report a measure comprehensive
income loss, of all changes in equity of an enterprise that
result from transactions and other economic events in a period
other than transactions with owners. Accumulated other
comprehensive loss, as presented on the accompanying audited
consolidated balance sheets, consists of unrealized gains and

4,165     3,409     5,039     Guarantees   The Company adopted FASB Interpretation No45,
Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others, FIN45 on January1, 2003.
The provision for initial recognition and measurement of
liability is applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued
or modified after December31, 2002. FIN45 expands
previously issued accounting guidance and disclosure
requirements for certain guarantees and requires recognition of
an initial liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed
by issuing a guarantee. As an element of standard commercial
terms in its standard sales contracts for UltiPro, the Company
includes an indemnification clause that indemnifies the customer
against certain liabilities and damages arising from any claims
of patent, copyright, or other proprietary rights of any third
party. Due to the nature of the intellectual property
indemnification provided to   
57 Table of Contents   its customers, the Company cannot estimate the fair value, or
determine the total nominal amount, of the indemnification until
such time as a claim for such indemnification is made. In the
event of a claim made against the Company under such provision,
the Company evaluates estimated losses for such indemnification
under SFASNo5, Accounting for
Contingencies, as interpreted by FIN45, considering
such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable
outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the
amount of loss. To date, the Company has not had any claims made
against it under such provision and, accordingly, has not
accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in its
consolidated financial statements.   Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections   The Company adopted SFASNo154, Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections SFAS154,
which replaces APB Opinion No20, Accounting
Changes APB20 and FASB Statement
No3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim
Financial Statements SFAS3 effective
December31, 2006. APB20 required that changes in
accounting principles be recognized by including the cumulative
effect of the change in the period in which the new accounting
principle was adopted. SFAS154 requires retrospective
application of the change to prior periods financial
statements, unless it is impracticable to determine the
period-specific effects of the change. SFAS154 also
provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a
long-lived non-financial asset be accounted for as a change in
estimate effected by a change in accounting principle, and also
provides that correction of errors in previously issued
financial statements should be termed a restatement.
The FASB identified the reason for the issuance of SFAS154
to be part of a broader attempt to eliminate differences with
the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
The adoption of SFAS154 did not have an impact on the
Companys consolidated financial statements.   Segment
Information   The Company adopted SFASNo131, Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,

EITF 01-14
requires companies to characterize reimbursements received for
out-of-pocket
expenses incurred. Reimbursable
out-of-pocket
expenses, which are included in services revenues and cost of
services revenues in the Companys accompanying
consolidated statements of operations, were $14million,
$13million and $10million for 2006, 2005 and 2004
respectively.   Recent
Accounting Literature   In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No159, The Fair Value Option
for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Including an
amendment of FASB Statement No115,
SFASNo159. SFASNo159
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments
and certain other items at fair value. Most of the provisions of
this Statement apply only to entities that elect the fair value
option. However, the amendment to FASB Statement No115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities, SFASNo115, applies
to all entities with
available-for-sale
and trading securities. SFASNo159 is effective for
the Companys consolidated financial statements for the
annual reporting period beginning after November15, 2007.
The company is currently evaluating the impact of this new
pronouncement on its consolidated financial statements.   In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No157, Fair Value
Measurements SFASNo157.
SFASNo157 defines fair value as used in numerous
accounting   
58 Table of Contents   pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
in GAAP and expands disclosures related to the use of fair value
measures in financial statements. SFASNo157 does
not expand the use of fair value measures in financial
statements, but standardizes its definition and guidance in GAAP
and emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement and
not an entity-specific measurement based on an exchange
transaction in which the entity sells an asset or transfers a
liability exit price. SFASNo157 establishes a
fair value hierarchy from observable market data as the highest
level to fair value based on an entitys own fair value
assumptions as the lowest level. SFASNo157 is
effective for the Companys consolidated financial
statements for interim and annual reporting periods beginning
after November15, 2007. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of this new pronouncement on its
consolidated financial statements.   In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,
FASNo48. The interpretation clarifies
the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a
companys financial statements in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No109, Accounting
for Income Taxes. Specifically, the pronouncement
prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute
for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The
interpretation also provides guidance on the related
derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
accounting for interim periods, disclosure and transition of
uncertain tax positions. FASNo48 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of this new pronouncement on
its consolidated financial statements.   In March 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF
reached a consensus on EITF Issue
No06-3,
How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income
Statement That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation,
EITF
No06-3,
that entities may adopt a policy of presenting taxes in the
income statement either on a gross or net basis. Gross or net
presentation may be elected for each different type of tax, but
similar taxes should be presented consistently. Taxes within the
scope of this EITF would include taxes that are imposed on a
revenue transaction between the seller and a customer e.g.,
sales taxes, use taxes, value-added taxes, and some types of
excise taxes. EITF
No06-3
is effective for the Companys financial statements for
interim and annual reporting periods beginning after
December15, 2006. The Company believes that EITF
No06-3
will not have a material impact on the Companys
consolidated financial statements.

ACQUISITION   On October5, 2006, the Company acquired 100% of the common
stock of RTIX Limited, a UnitedKingdom company, now known
as The Ultimate Software Group UK Limited, and its wholly-owned
U.S.subsidiary, RTIX Americas, Inc. collectively,
RTIX, The results of RTIXs operations have
been included in the Companys consolidated financial
statements since that date. RTIX developed the performance
management/appraisals solution that Ultimate Software has
offered its customers since February 2006 the RTIX
Performance Management Product. Ultimate Software is
marketing and selling the performance management, appraisals,
and learning management solution as UltiPro Talent Management, a
stand-alone product set, in the United Kingdom, and continuing
to offer the performance and learning management feature sets as
optional features to
U.S.-based
companies.   The aggregate purchase price was $40million, payable in
the form of $34million in cash and 27,897shares of
the Companys Common Stock, per value $001per share
Common Stock the Stock
Consideration. Pursuant to the stock purchase agreement
with RTIX, the Stock Consideration is subject to a downward
adjustment based on RTIXs recurring revenues over a
twelve-month period beginning October5, 2006, recorded in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States, and will be delivered within 30days after
the final determination of any such adjustments. The Company did
not record the impact of the issuance of the Stock Consideration
as of December31, 2006 and will evaluate the recurring
revenues of RTIX on a monthly basis, cumulative from
October5, 2006, to determine when, and the extent to
which, the contingency has been satisfied, at which time the
Stock Consideration will be recorded in the Companys
consolidated financial statements as an increase in goodwill.

approximately $450 thousand of the purchase price represents the
estimated fair value of acquired customer relationships in the
United Kingdom U.K., $30 thousand represents the estimated
fair value of backlog in the U.K. and $550 thousand represents
the estimated fair value of the acquired developed technology
for the RTIX Performance Management Product. The balance of
the acquired intangibles, net of amortization, is included in
other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet.
The Company assumed net liabilities of $137 thousand and
incurred direct costs of $227 thousand in relation to the
acquisition. There was no value assigned to acquired in-process
research and development projects. The balance of
$27million was recorded as goodwill. Since the RTIX
Acquisition was a stock purchase, goodwill and acquired
intangibles are not deductible for tax purposes.   The value assigned to each of the intangible assets included in
the RTIX valuation were based on an income approach valuation
methodology. The income approach presumes that the value of an
asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit i.e., cash
flows to be received over the life of the asset, discounted to
present value.   As of December31, 2006, the Companys intangible
assets have estimated useful lives and are classified as follows

STAFF
ACCOUNTING BULLETINNO108   During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company adopted the
provisions of Staff Accounting BulletinNo108,
Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements SAB108. SAB108
addresses how the effects of prior-year uncorrected
misstatements should be considered when quantifying
misstatements in current-year financial statements. SAB108
requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance
sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether
either approach results in quantifying an error that is material
in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors.   During 2005, the Company identified prior year misstatements
covering 1998 through 2005related to accounting for rent
holidays associated with the construction periods of certain
real estate leases. The Company assessed the materiality for
each of the years impacted by these misstatements, using the
permitted rollover method or income statement approach, and
determined that the effect on the financial statements, taken as
a whole, was not material. As allowed by SAB108, the
Company elected to not restate prior year financial statements
and, instead as permitted by SAB108, increased the 2006
beginning balance of the accumulated deficit and deferred rent
in the amount of $18million.

the Companys eligible accounts receivable. The Credit
Facility was comprised of a revolving line of credit the

consistency of the cash flow position as well as
managements expectations for the next twelve months, the
Company chose not to renew the Credit Facility upon its
expiration. The Credit Facilitys Equipment Loan, while
still effective, did not have any future borrowing capacity
after May27, 2006. The outstanding balance of
$07million under the Equipment Loan as

64 Table of Contents   The Company has provided a full valuation allowance on the
deferred tax assets as realization of such amounts is not
considered more likely than not. The Company reviews the
valuation allowance requirement periodically and makes
adjustments as warranted. Of the total valuation allowance at
December31, 2006, approximately $14,100,000 is attributed
to net operating losses generated from the exercise of
non-statutory employee stock options, the benefit of which will
be credited to additional paid-in capital when realized. Of the
change in the valuation allowance for 2006, 2005 and 2004
approximately $8,293,000, $3,678,000, and $1,466,000,
respectively is attributable to exercise of non-statutory
employee stock options.   At December31, 2006, the Company had approximately
$76,000,000 of net operating loss carryforwards for Federal
income tax reporting purposes available to offset future taxable
income. Of the total net operating loss carryforwards,
approximately $34,727,000 is attributable to deductions from the
exercise of non-statutory employee stock options. Due to the
RTIX Acquisition, the Company recorded a net deferred tax
liability of $287,000 which resulted in a decrease in the
valuation allowance. The carryforwards expire through 2026.
Utilization of such net operating losses may be limited as a
result of cumulative ownership changes in the Companys
equity instruments.

Accounting BulletinNo108   In September 2006, the SEC released Staff Accounting
BulletinNo108, Considering the Effects of

COMPENSATION   Summary
of Plans   The Companys 2005 Equity and Incentive Plan the
Plan authorizes the grant of options to directors,
officers and employees of the Company to purchase shares of the
Companys Common Stock. The Plan also authorizes the grant
to such persons of restricted and non-restricted shares of
Common Stock, stock appreciation rights, stock units and cash
performance awards collectively, and together with stock
options, the Awards. The Plan was approved by the
Companys stockholders at the annual meeting of
stockholders on   
65 Table of Contents   May17, 2005. Prior to that date, options to purchase
shares of Common Stock were issued under the Companys
Nonqualified Stock Option Plan the Prior Plan.
Effective May17, 2005, no additional options may be
granted under the Prior Plan. However, options previously
granted under the Prior Plan remain outstanding to the extent
they have not been exercised and have not expired. The aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock authorized under the Plan and
the Prior Plan is 9,000,000. As of December31, 2006, the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that were available
to be issued under all Awards granted under the Plan was
575,931shares. Options granted to officers and employees
under the Plan and the Prior Plan generally have a
10-year
term, vesting 25% immediately and 25% on the anniversary of the
grant date for each of the following three years. Options
granted to non-employee directors under the Plan and the Prior
Plan generally have a
10-year term
and vest immediately on the grant date. However, options granted
to non-employee directors for board services under the Plan
first become exercisable on the earliest of ithe fifth
anniversary of the date of grant, iithe date on which
the director ceases to be a member of the Board of Directors or
iiithe effective date of a change in control of the
Company.   Fair

No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. Prior to January1, 2006, stock-based
compensation expense was recognized only for grants of
restricted stock awards, stock units and stock options which
were granted at exercise prices less than the fair market value
of the underlying Common Stock on the grant date. During the
year ended December31, 2005, while there were no grants of
stock units, there were grants of restricted stock awards. For
the year ended December31, 2004, there were no grants of
stock units or restricted stock awards. In addition, for the two
years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, stock options that
had exercise prices less than the fair market value of the
Common Stock on the grant date were granted to certain members
of the Board of Directors for board services and fully vested on
the grant date. Therefore, stock-based compensation expense for
the year ended December31, 2005 is related to both
restricted stock awards granted and the options granted to
certain members of the Board for board services, recorded in
accordance with APB No25. Stock-based compensation
expense for the year ended December31, 2004 is related to
the options granted to certain members of the Board for board
services, recorded in accordance with APB No25.   On January1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of
SFASNo123R, which requires the Company to recognize
expense related to the fair value of stock-based compensation
awards. The Company elected the modified prospective transition
method as permitted by SFASNo123R and therefore has
not restated the financial results for prior periods. Under the
modified prospective method, stock-based compensation expense
for year ended December31, 2006, includes compensation
expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted prior
to, but not yet vested as of, January1, 2006, based on
grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of SFASNo123 and compensation expense
for all stock-based compensation awards granted subsequent to
January1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the provisions of
SFASNo123R. In addition, options granted to certain
members of the Board of Directors for Board Services recorded in
accordance with SFASNo123R and the issuance of
restricted stock awards and stock units are also included in
stock-based compensation for the year ended December31,
2006. The Company recognizes compensation expense for restricted
stock awards and restricted stock units on a straight-line basis
over the requisite service period of the award.

of UltiPro Canada during the fiscal year ended December31,
2006. This amount would have otherwise been charged to research
and development expense for the year ended December31,
2006.   Net cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and
warrants were $86million and $58million for the
years ended December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. No
income tax benefit was realized from stock option exercises
during years ended December31, 2006 and 2005.   Prior to January1, 2006, the Company accounted for its
stock-based compensation plan as permitted by
SFASNo123, using the intrinsic value method
prescribed in APB No25, and made the pro forma
disclosures required by SFASNo148 for the years
ended December31, 2005 and 2004. Except for options
granted to certain members of the Board for Board Services, all
options granted under the Plan and Prior Plan had exercise
prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying Common
Stock on the date of grant.   The following table illustrates the effect on net income loss

855     595     502   The Companys computation of the expected volatility for
the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is based
primarily upon historical volatility and the expected term of
the option. The expected term is based on the historical
exercise experience under the share-based plans of the
underlying award including post-vesting employment termination
behavior and represents the period of time the share-based
awards are expected to be outstanding. The interest rate is
based on the U.S.Treasury yield in effect at the time of
grant for a period commensurate with the estimated expected
life. Pursuant to implementing SFAS123R effective
January1, 2006, the Company is required to estimate
forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in
subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
estimates. The weighted-average forfeiture rate of 5% for the
year ended December31, 2006 was based on historical data.   Restricted
Stock Awards   Under the provisions of the Plan, the Company may, at its
discretion, grant restricted stock awards to certain officers
and employees Restricted Stock Awards. The shares
of Common Stock issued under Restricted Stock Awards are subject
to certain vesting requirements and restrictions on transfer.
During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company
granted Restricted Stock Awards for 263,000shares of
Common Stock of which none has been forfeited as of
December31, 2006. During the year ended December31,
2005, the Company granted Restricted Stock Awards for
169,000shares of Common Stock of which none has been
forfeited as of December31, 2006. There were no Restricted
Stock Awards granted for the year ended December31, 2004.
Compensation expense for Restricted Stock Awards is measured
based on the closing market price of the Companys Common
Stock at the date of grant and is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period. Holders of Restricted Stock
Awards have all rights of a stockholder including the right to
vote the shares and receive all dividends and other
distributions paid or made with respect thereto. Each Award
becomes vested on the fourth anniversary of the respective date
of grant, subject to the grantees continued employment
with the Company or any of its subsidiaries on each such vesting
date and subject further to accelerated vesting in the event of
a change in control of the Company, the employees death or
disability or the termination of his employment by the Company
without cause. Included in the Companys financial results
for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005 was
$14million and $02million, respectively, of
compensation expense for Restricted Stock Awards. There was no
compensation expense for Restricted Stock Awards included in the
Companys financial results for the year ended
December31, 2004.   Stock
Unit Awards   The Company may, at its discretion, make awards of stock units
under the Plan Stock Unit Awards to certain
officers and employees. A Stock Unit Award is a grant of a
number of hypothetical share units with respect to shares of
Common Stock that are subject to vesting and transfer
restrictions and conditions under a stock unit award agreement.
The value of each unit is equal to the fair market value of one
share of Common Stock on any applicable date of determination.
The payment with respect to each unit under a Stock Unit Award
may be made, at the discretion of the compensation committee of
the Board of Directors, in cash or shares of Common Stock or in
a combination of both. The grantee of a Stock Unit Award does
not have any rights as a   
68 Table of Contents   stockholder with respect to the shares subject to a Stock Unit
Award until such time as shares of Common Stock are delivered to
the grantee pursuant to the terms of the related stock unit
award agreement.   As provided for in the Plan, the Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Operating Officer collectively, the Executive
Officers deferred receipt of one-half of their cash
performance awards under the Plan for 2006 and 2005 in exchange
for the grant of Stock Unit Awards under the Plan the
Elected Deferral. Upon this election, the Company
provided a matching contribution equal to one-half of the amount
deferred the Company Match. The number of stock
units subject to such Stock Unit Award is determined by dividing
the total amount deferred including the Company Match by the
fair market value of a share of the Companys Common Stock
on the date of payment of the non-deferred portion of the cash
performance awards. The Stock Unit Awards vest on the fourth
anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the Executive
Officers continued employment with the Company, or any of
its subsidiaries, on such vesting date and subject further to
accelerated vesting in the event of a change in control of the
Company, the Executive Officers death or disability or the
termination of his employment by the Company without cause. The
vested Stock Unit Awards are payable in shares of Common Stock
upon the earliest to occur of the fifth anniversary of the date
of grant, the Executive Officers death, disability or
termination of employment with the Company or a change in
control of the Company. In the event that an Executive Officer
were to terminate employment and stock units resulting from his
Elected Deferral remain unvested, the Company would be required
to refund to the Executive Officer a cash amount equal to the
lesser of such Elected Deferral less taxes withheld and the
fair market value of such units upon termination of employment.
During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company
granted 28,518 stock units to the Executive Officers, of which
none has been forfeited as of December31, 2006. During the
years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, no Stock Unit
Awards were granted. Included in the Companys financial
results for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005 was
$03million and $04million, respectively, of
compensation expense from Stock Unit Awards. There was no
compensation expense from Stock Unit Awards included in the
Companys financial results for the year ended
December31, 2004.

COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES   Operating
Leases   The Company leases corporate office space and certain equipment
under non-cancellable operating lease agreements expiring at
various dates. Total rent expense under these agreements was
$2,738,000, $2,189,000 and $2,659,000 for the years ended
December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Future

Liability   Software products such as those offered by the Company
frequently contain undetected errors or failures when first
introduced or as new versions are released. Testing of the
Companys products is particularly challenging because it
is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing
environments in which the Companys customers may deploy
these products. Despite extensive testing, the Company from time
to time has discovered defects or errors in products. There can
be no assurance that such defects, errors or difficulties will
not cause delays in product introductions and shipments, result
in increased costs and diversion of development resources,
require design modifications or decrease market acceptance or
customer satisfaction with the Companys products. In
addition, there can be no assurance that, despite testing by the
Company and by current and potential customers, errors will not
be found after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting
in loss of or delay in market acceptance, which could have a
material adverse effect upon the Companys business,
operating results and financial condition.   Litigation   From
time-to-time,
the Company is involved in litigation relating to claims arising
out of its operations in the normal course of business. The
Company is not currently a party to any legal proceeding the
adverse outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on the Companys operating results or financial condition.

RELATED
PARTY TRANSACTIONS   During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company began leasing
equipment with a computer leasing company the Leasing
Company that is owned by an irrevocable trust the
Trust for the benefit of the children of Robert A.
Yanover, a member of the Companys Board of Directors.
Additionally, the Leasing Companys business is managed and
operated by a management company the Management
Company pursuant to a management agreement.
Mr.Yanover has a 50% ownership interest in the general
partner of the   
73 Table of Contents   Management Company. The Company did not finance equipment with
the Leasing Company in 2006, 2005 or 2004. The Company financed
equipment with the Leasing Company totaling $1,007,000 and
$258,000 during 2002 and 2001, respectively. Related
amortization was $0, $0 and $331,000 and total cash paid was $0,
$0 and $499,000 during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
unamortized capital lease obligation with the Leasing Company
and related accumulated amortization were both $0 at
December31, 2006 and 2005 and $0 and $1,265,000,
respectively, at December31, 2004. The Company believes
that the terms of the leases were no less favorable to the
Company than could have been obtained from an unaffiliated party.   On October23, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors
elected Al Leiter to the Companys Board of Directors,
effective October23, 2006. During October 2002,
Mr.Leiter entered into an agreement with the Company
pursuant to which he agreed to iattend and participate
in certain internal meetings of the Company; iiassist
the Companys salespeople with prospects; and
iiiact as an official spokesperson for the Company in
exchange for which the Company agreed to make contributions to
Leiters Landing, Mr.Leiters non-profit
charitable organization benefiting children, in the amount of
one tenth 1/10 of one percent, or 01%, of the Companys
total revenue as reported on its financial statements. Pursuant
to this agreement, for the fiscal years ended December31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company contributed a total of
approximately $107,000, $84,000 and $68,000, respectively to
Leiters Landing. In February 2007, Mr.Leiter and the
Company agreed that the maximum amount payable by the Company in
any one year under this agreement is $200,000.

EMPLOYEE
BENEFIT PLAN   The Company provides retirement benefits for eligible employees,
as defined, through a defined contribution benefit plan that is
qualified under Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code
the Plan. Contributions to the Plan, which are
made at the sole discretion of the Company, were $918,000,
$756,000 and $718,000 for the years ended December31,

SUBSEQUENT
EVENT   Effective February28, 2007, the Companys Chief
Executive Officer CEO voluntarily forfeited a
restricted stock award for 60,000 shares of Common Stock which
was granted to him at the February6, 2007 meeting of the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors the
Compensation Committee under the Companys
2005 Equity and Incentive Plan the Plan. The CEO
voluntarily forfeited these shares because their issuance
inadvertently caused the Company to have exceeded the limit on
shares authorized for issuance under the Plan. In addition, the
cancellation allowed the Company to have sufficient shares
authorized under the Plan for the Company to provide stock
options to purchase shares of Common Stock to new employees
hired between February6, 2007 and May15, 2007, the
date of the 2007 annual meeting of the Companys
stockholders the Annual Meeting. The Company will
propose in its 2007 proxy statement that stockholders approve at
the Annual Meeting a 3,000,000 share increase in the number of
shares that may be issued pursuant to awards under the Plan the
Proposal to Amend the Plan.   The cancellation of the CEOs restricted stock award was
accompanied by the Companys concurrent offer to grant a
replacement award of similar value to the CEO. Accordingly, the
Compensation Committee adopted a resolution by unanimous written
consent dated as of March13, 2007 approving the grant to
the CEO of an award of 60,000 restricted shares of Common Stock,
contingent upon the approval by the Companys stockholders

Controls
and Procedures   Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of the Companys management,
including the Chief Executive Officer the CEO and
the Chief Financial Officer the CFO, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period
covered by this report pursuant to Securities Exchange Act of
1934
Rule13a-15.
Based on that evaluation, the Companys management,
including the CEO and CFO, concluded that the Companys
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
alerting them to material information required to be included in
the Companys periodic SEC reports. It should be noted that
the design of any system of controls is based in part upon
certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and
there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in
achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions, regardless of how remote.   Managements
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act
Rules13a-15f.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation under the framework in Internal
Control Integrated Framework, our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December31, 2006. Our managements
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2006 has been
audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their report, which is included below.   
75 Table of Contents   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   The Board of Directors and Stockholders   The Ultimate Software Group, Inc.   We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting that The Ultimate Software Group, Inc.
and subsidiaries the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
Company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
Companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.
Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the COSO.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of
December31, 2006 and 2005 and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity and
comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December31, 2006, and
our report dated March16, 2007 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements.   /s/KPMG

to a third party to assist in identifying or evaluating
