third anniversary of the date he or she became an outside

granted an option to purchase 10,000shares of Common Stock
aSubsequent Option each year on the date of
such anniversary, provided he or she is then a non-employee
director. Each non-employee director will be eligible to receive
a Subsequent Option, regardless of whether such non-employee
director was eligible to receive a First Option. First Options
and each Subsequent Option will have a term of ten years.
One-third of the shares subject to a First Option will vest one
year after its date of grant and an additional one-third will
vest at the end of each year thereafter, provided that the
optionee continues to serve as a director on such dates. All of
the shares subject to a Subsequent Option will vest one year
