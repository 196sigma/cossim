31  SCHOOL SPECIALTY, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts  NOTE 1ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  School Specialty, Inc. the Company, is a Wisconsin corporation. The Company reincorporated from Delaware to Wisconsin effective August 29, 2000. The Company is primarily a direct marketer of supplemental
educational products to schools and teachers for pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements include the accounts of School Specialty, Inc., its subsidiaries and the companies acquired in business
combinations from their respective dates of acquisition. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  NOTE 2SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Definition of Fiscal Year  The Companys
fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in April in each year. As used in these consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements, fiscal 2003, fiscal 2002, and fiscal 2001
refer to the Companys fiscal years ended April 26, 2003, April 27, 2002, and April 28, 2001, respectively. All fiscal years reported represent 52 weeks. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents  The Company considers cash investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.  Inventories  Inventories, which consist primarily of products held for sale, are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost
generally determined on a weighted-average basis.  Property, Plant and
Equipment  Property, plant and equipment are stated at
cost. Additions and improvements are capitalized, whereas, maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective
assets. The estimated useful lives range from twenty-five to forty years for buildings and its components and three to fifteen years for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Property and equipment leased under capital leases is being amortized over
the lesser of its useful life or its lease term. As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived 
32  SCHOOL SPECIALTY, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts 
Assets, the Company reviews property, plant and equipment for impairment if events or circumstances indicate an asset might be impaired.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets
acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method. The Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets at the beginning of fiscal 2002. As a result of this adoption, goodwill is no longer
subject to amortization but rather must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate goodwill might be impaired. Prior to fiscal 2002, goodwill was amortized using the straight-line method over fifteen to
forty years. Other amortizable intangible assets include customer relationships, non-compete agreements and order backlog and are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to fifteen years. Certain other intangible assets
are estimated to have indefinite lives and are not subject to amortization.  Investments  The Company held a preferred
stock investment in a company which had been accounted for under the cost method. Under this method, the Companys investment was stated at cost and was periodically evaluated for impairment. As a result of this evaluation, the Company
wrote-off the investment due to the deteriorating financial condition of the company, reporting an impairment charge of $1,657 during fiscal 2002, which is included in other expense in the consolidated statements of operations.  The Company had an investment in the common stock of Riverdeep Group plc,
which was classified and accounted for as an available-for-sale security under SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Unrealized holding gains, net of tax, related to this investment were reported
as other comprehensive income, a component of shareholders equity. During fiscal 2002, the investment was sold, resulting in a realized pre-tax loss of $329.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The carrying amounts of the Companys financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued
liabilities approximate fair value. The estimated fair value of long-term debt approximated its carrying value at April 26, 2003, with the exception of the Companys convertible debt, which at April 26, 2003 had a carrying value of $149,500 and
a fair market value of $142,212.  Income Taxes  Income taxes have been computed utilizing the asset and liability approach
which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. 
33  SCHOOL SPECIALTY, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts 
Revenue Recognition 
Revenue is recognized upon the shipment of products or upon the completion of services provided to customers, which corresponds to the time when risk
of ownership transfers.  Concentration of Credit Risks
The Company grants credit to customers in the ordinary
course of business. The majority of the Companys customers are schools. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the significant number of customers and their geographic dispersion. During fiscal 2003,
2002 and 2001, no customer represented more than 10% of revenues or accounts receivable.  Vendor Rebates  Vendor
rebates relating to product purchases are recognized as a reduction in cost of revenues over the estimated period the related product is sold.  Deferred Catalog Costs  Deferred catalog costs represent costs which have been paid to produce Company catalogs, net of vendor cooperative advertising payments, which will be
used in and benefit future periods. Deferred catalog costs are amortized in amounts proportionate to expected revenues over the life of the catalog, which is one year or less. Amortization expense related to deferred catalog costs is included in the
consolidated statement of operations as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Such amortization expense for fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, was $28,686, $28,658 and $22,905, respectively.  Shipping and Handling Costs  The Company accounts for shipping and handling costs as a cost of revenues
for shipments made directly from vendors to customers. For shipments made from the Companys warehouses, the Company accounts for shipping and handling costs as a selling, general and administrative expense. The amount of shipping and handling
costs in selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $35,958, $29,909 and $28,561, respectively.  Foreign Currency Translation  The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries have been translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency
Translation. All balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Amounts in the statement of operations have been translated using the average exchange rate for the year. Resulting
translation adjustments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of other comprehensive income.  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company accounts for its employee stock option plans under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. Under APB Opinion No. 25, no stock-based compensation is reflected in net income, as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal
to the market value of the 
34  SCHOOL SPECIALTY, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts 
underlying common stock on the date of grant and the related number of shares granted is fixed at that point in time.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which supercedes Emerging Issues Task Force EITF No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and
Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. SFAS No. 146 addresses the accounting and reporting for one-time employee termination benefits, certain contract termination costs and other costs
associated with exit or disposal activities. SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 146 during fiscal 2003 with no material impact on the
Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In November 2002, the FASB issued EITF No. 02-16, Accounting by a Reseller for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor. EITF No. 02-16 addresses the accounting issues pertaining to cash consideration received by a reseller
from a vendor. EITF No. 02-16 must be applied in financial statements for periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The Company adopted the provisions of EITF No. 02-16 during fiscal 2003 with no material impact on the Companys financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.  In November
2002, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies and elaborates on
the requirement for entities to recognize a liability and provide disclosures relating to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in a guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees
issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 45 during fiscal 2003 with no material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for
Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure. This statement amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair
value based method of accounting and records compensation expense for all stock-based employee compensation. It also amends the disclosure provisions of that statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an
entitys accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based employee compensation. Finally, this statement amends APB Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial
statements. The amendment of the transition and annual disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The amendment of the disclosure requirements of APB Opinion No. 28 is effective for
financial reports containing condensed consolidated financial statements for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Since the Company has not elected to change to the fair value based method of accounting, the transition provisions of
SFAS No. 148 have no impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
35  SCHOOL SPECIALTY, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts 
In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN
46 requires companies with variable interests in variable interest entities to evaluate whether they must consolidate these entities subject to the provisions included in FIN 46. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46 apply immediately to variable
interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to entities created prior to January 31, 2003 in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company early adopted the provisions
of FIN 46 during fiscal 2003 by evaluating the impact of FIN 46 as it related to the Companys accounts receivable securitization. The Company concluded that the adoption of FIN 46 would have no material impact on the Companys financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.  In May 2003,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. This statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments
with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. This statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15,
2003. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this statement.  Reclassifications  Certain amounts previously
reported have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.  NOTE 3GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  Effective at the beginning of fiscal 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, which resulted in goodwill no longer being subject to amortization, but rather an annual impairment test. The following information presents what reported net
income, basic earnings per share basic EPS and diluted earnings per share diluted EPS would have been had SFAS No. 142 been adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2001:  Fiscal2003

2001 acquisition of J.L. Hammett. The Specialty segment adjustments during fiscal 2002 represent additional cash consideration paid to the former owners of Global Video of $210 and final purchase accounting adjustments of $170. The balance of the
fiscal 2002 adjustments represent foreign currency translation. The Specialty segment adjustments during fiscal 2003 of $3,190 are primarily associated with Premier Agendas. Specifically, $447 is for exit costs, consisting of employee termination
and facility closure costs related to the closure of regional sales offices, which was substantially completed during fiscal 2003. Additional adjustments of $2,611 are primarily from foreign currency translation. In addition to the Premier Agenda
adjustments, $132 in adjustments relate to the Premier Science acquisition, with $100 in adjustments representing additional purchase price related to an earn-out provision, which was paid in fiscal 2003, and $32 of final purchase accounting
adjustments.  NOTE 4BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  Fiscal 2003  On August 14, 2002 the Company acquired ABC School Supply and related affiliates ABC for an aggregate purchase

On September 30, 1998, the Company entered into a five year secured $350,000 credit facility the
credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions, led by Bank of America, N.A. as Agent, consisting of a $250,000 revolving loan and a $100,000 term loan. Interest accrued at a rate of, at the Companys option, either
LIBOR plus an applicable margin of up to 225% or the lenders base rate plus an applicable margin of up to 100%. The Company also pays a fee of up to 05% on the unborrowed amount under the revolving loan. On April 11, 2003, the Company
amended the credit facility. The amended credit facility matures on April 11, 2006 and provides for a $250,000 revolving loan. Interest accrues at a rate of, at the Companys option, either LIBOR plus an applicable margin of up to 275%, or the
lenders base rate plus an applicable margin of up to 150%. The Company also pays a commitment fee of up to 05% on unborrowed funds.  The credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and contains certain financial covenants. The Company was in compliance
with these covenants at April 26, 2003. At April 26, 2003, the balance outstanding under the credit facility was $125,700. The effective interest rate under the credit facility for fiscal 2003 was 522%, which includes amortization of the loan
origination fee and commitment fee on unborrowed funds.  On
July 30, 2001, the Company sold an aggregate principal amount of $130,000 of 60% convertible subordinated notes of the Company that are due in full on August 1, 2008. The notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity into shares of School
Specialty, Inc. common stock at a conversion price of $3229 per share and accrue interest payable semi-annually. There are no scheduled principal payments due prior to maturity. Net proceeds from the sale of these notes were $125,675. On August 2,
2001, the initial purchasers of the notes exercised their option to purchase additional notes in full and purchased an additional $19,500 aggregate principal amount of the notes, with net proceeds of $18,915. The Company used the total net proceeds
from the offering of $144,590 to repay a portion of the debt outstanding under the credit facility.  In November 2000, the Company entered into two sale-leaseback transactions which are accounted for as financings due to a technical default provision
within the leases which could allow, under remote circumstances, for continuing ownership involvement by the Company in the two properties. Under the agreements, the Company recorded debt of $18,525, which has an effective interest rate of 897 excluding amortization of loan fees. The leases expire in November 2020.  The Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on December 13, 2000 effective date of January 2, 2001, with The Bank of New York covering $50,000 of the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. On
April 29, 2001, the Company began accounting for the swap in accordance with SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which requires derivative instruments, such as this interest rate swap, to be
recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value. The swap was designated as a cash flow hedge and was considered highly effective throughout its term. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 133, the Company
recognized the fair value of the swap liability of $660 $396 net of tax with the net of tax offset to accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the date of adoption. Subsequent net of tax changes in the swaps fair value of $163 were
recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss during fiscal 2002, all of which was reclassified to the fiscal 2002s consolidated statement of operations when the hedged item affected earnings. The swap agreement fixed the
30-day LIBOR interest rate at 607% per annum on the $50,000 notional amount and had a one-year term which expired on January 2, 2002.  On October 28, 1998, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with The Bank of New York covering $50,000 of the outstanding credit
facility. The agreement fixed the 30-day LIBOR interest rate at 437% per annum on a $50,000 notional amount and had a three year term that was cancelable 
43  SCHOOL SPECIALTY, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts 
by The Bank of New York on the second anniversary. On October 30, 2000, The Bank of New York cancelled the swap agreement.  As a result of the above swap agreements, interest expense was increased
decreased in fiscal years 2002 and 2001 by $931 and $484, respectively.  The carrying value of variable rate long-term debt approximates fair value. The convertible subordinated notes had a fair value at April 26, 2003 of $142,212, determined using the closing bid price as reported on The
NASDs Portal Market on April 25, 2003.  Maturities of Long-Term Debt
Maturities of long-term debt, including capital lease
obligations, for subsequent fiscal years, are as follows:  2004 512

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  The Company and certain of its U.S.
subsidiaries entered into an agreement the Receivables Facility in November 2000 with a financial institution whereby it sells on a continuous basis an undivided interest in all eligible trade accounts receivable. Pursuant to the
Receivables Facility, the Company formed New School, Inc. NSI, a wholly-owned, special purpose, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary. As such, the assets of NSI will be available first and foremost to satisfy the claims of the creditors of
NSI. NSI was formed for the sole purpose of buying and selling receivables generated by the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company. Under the Receivables Facility, the Company and certain subsidiaries transfer without recourse all their
accounts receivables to NSI. NSI, in turn, has sold and, subject to certain conditions, may from time to time sell an undivided interest in these receivables and is permitted to receive advances of up to $100,000 for the sale of such undivided
interest. The Company receives a fee from the financial institution for billing and collection functions, which remain the responsibility of the Company, that approximates fair value. The agreement, as amended, expires on November 18, 2003. The
Companys retained interests in the receivables sold are recorded at fair value, which approximates cost, due to the short-term nature of the receivables sold.  This two-step transaction is accounted for as a sale of receivables under the provision of SFAS No. 140, Accounting
for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities. There was $46,000 advanced under the Receivables Facility at April 26, 2003 and $50,000 advanced at April 27, 2002, accordingly, these amounts of accounts
receivable have been removed from the consolidated balance sheets. Costs associated with the sale of receivables, primarily related to the discount and loss on sale, were $1,839, $1,985 and $1,389 and are included in other expenses in the
consolidated statement of operations for fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

additional employee stock options outstanding of 529, 128, and 259 during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, that were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because they were anti-dilutive. Additionally, the impact of the conversion
of the convertible debt to common stock has been excluded from the computation of fiscal 2002 diluted EPS because it was anti-dilutive.  Employee Stock Plans  The Company has two stock-based employee compensation plans. On June 10, 1998, the Companys Board of Directors approved the School Specialty, Inc.
1998 Stock Incentive Plan the 1998 Plan and on August 27, 2002 the Companys Board of Directors approved the School Specialty, Inc. 2002 Stock Incentive Plan the 2002 Plan. Both plans have been approved by the
Companys shareholders. The purpose of the 1998 Plan and the 2002 Plan is to provide directors, officers, key employees and consultants with additional incentives by increasing their ownership interests in the Company. Under the 1998 Plan, the
maximum number of options available for grant is equal to 20% of the Companys outstanding common stock. Under the 2002 Plan, the maximum number of options available for grant is 1,500 shares.  The Company accounts for options issued in accordance with APB Opinion No.
25. Accordingly, because the exercise price of the options are equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense has been recognized for the options granted to employees and directors. Had compensation
expense related to the Companys stock option grants to employees and directors been recognized based upon the fair value of the stock options on the grant date under the methodology prescribed by SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation, the Companys net income and net income per share would have been impacted as indicated in the following table:

United States, with limited Specialty segment operations in Canada. Both internal and external reporting conforms to this organizational structure, with no significant differences in accounting policies applied. The Company evaluates the performance
of its segments and allocates resources to them based on revenue growth and profitability. While the segments serve a similar customer base, notable differences exist in products, gross margin and revenue growth rates. Products supplied within the
Traditional segment include consumables consisting of classroom supplies, instructional materials, educational games, art supplies and school forms, school furniture and indoor and outdoor equipment. Products supplied within the Specialty segment
primarily target specific educational disciplines, such as art, industrial arts, physical education, sciences, and early childhood. This segment also supplies student academic planners, videos and DVDs. The accounting policies of the segments are
the same as those described in Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.  The following table presents segment information:  Fiscal2003
