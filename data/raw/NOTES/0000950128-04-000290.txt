Item8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data The
Companys financial statements from and after the effective date of the
plan of reorganization, August1, 2003, are those of a new reporting entity Reorganized Company and
are not comparable to the pre-confirmation periods of the old reporting entity
Predecessor Company. As a result, the independent auditors prepared two
reports, one for the financial statements of the Reorganized Company and the
other for the financial statements of the Predecessor Company. Report of Independent Auditors To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporation In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and stockholders equity
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporation and its subsidiaries Reorganized Company at
December31, 2003 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
the period from August1, 2003 to December31, 2003 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. As discussed in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Ohio confirmed the
Companys Third Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization the plan on June18,
2003. Confirmation of the plan resulted in the discharge of all claims against
the Company that arose before November16, 2000 and substantially alters or
terminates all rights and interests of equity security holders as provided for
in the plan. The plan was substantially consummated on August1, 2003 and the
Company emerged from bankruptcy. In connection with its emergence from
bankruptcy, the Company adopted fresh start accounting as of August1, 2003. s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

March 9, 2004 35 Table of Contents Report of Independent Auditors To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporation In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in stockholders
equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporation and its subsidiaries Predecessor Company at
December31, 2002 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
the period from January1, 2003 to July31, 2003, and for each of the two years
in the period ended December31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Companys management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. As discussed in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
filed a petition on November16, 2000 with the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the Northern District of Ohio for reorganization under the provisions of
Chapter11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Companys Third Amended Joint Plan of
Reorganization was substantially consummated on August1, 2003 and the Company
emerged from bankruptcy. In connection with its emergence from bankruptcy, the
Company adopted fresh start accounting. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

40 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE ABankruptcy and Reorganization Overview Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporation, or WPC, is a Delaware holding company
that, together with its several subsidiaries and joint ventures, constitutes
the sixth largest integrated producer of steel and steel products in the United
States. Our principal operating subsidiary is Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel
Corporation, or WPSC, a Delaware corporation whose headquarters are located in
Wheeling, West Virginia. WPC was organized as a Delaware corporation on June
27, 1920 under the name Wheeling Steel Corporation. We produce flat rolled steel products for the construction industry, steel
service centers, converters, processors, and the container, automotive and
appliance industries. Our product offerings are focused predominately on
higher value-added finished steel products such as cold-rolled products, tin
and zinc coated products and fabricated products. In addition, we produce
semi-finished steel products and hot-rolled steel products, which represent the
least processed of our finished goods. An operating division of WPSC, Wheeling Corrugating Company, also referred
to as WCC, manufactures our fabricated steel products for the construction,
agricultural and highway industries. WPSC also holds a percentage ownership
interest in two joint ventures that, together with WCC, account for nearly half
of our sales. These joint ventures, Wheeling-Nisshin, Inc. and Ohio Coatings
Company, also referred to as OCC, produce value-added steel products from
materials and products supplied by us. Bankruptcy and Reorganization On November16, 2000, WPC and eight of our then existing wholly-owned
subsidiaries, which represented substantially all of our business, filed
voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter11 of the United States Bankruptcy
Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Ohio.
We commenced the Chapter11 proceedings in order to restructure our outstanding
debts and to improve our access to the additional funding that we needed to
continue our operations. Throughout the Chapter11 proceedings, we remained in
possession of our properties and assets and continued to operate and manage our
businesses with the then existing directors and officers as
debtors-in-possession subject to the supervision of the Bankruptcy Court. As part of our Chapter11 proceedings, we filed our original Joint Plan of
Reorganization on December20, 2002, our First Amended Joint Plan of
Reorganization on January9, 2003, our Second Amended Joint Plan of
Reorganization on May5, 2003 and our Third Amended Joint Plan of
Reorganization on May19, 2003, reflecting the final negotiations with
pre-petition note holders, pre-petition trade creditors and unionized
employees. Our plan of reorganization was confirmed on June18, 2003 and became
effective on August1, 2003. We realized approximately $558million in
cancellation of debt income as a result of our reorganization. Following is a summary of some of the significant transactions consummated
on or about the effective date of our plan of reorganization   
WPC amended and restated its by-laws and filed a second amended and
restated certificate of incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of
State authorizing the issuance of up to an aggregate of 80million
shares of common stock, par value $001 per share, and 20million shares
of undesignated preferred stock, par value $0001 per share.     
WPC exchanged, on a pro rata basis, $275million in senior notes and
$75million in term notes that existed prior to its bankruptcy filing
for an aggregate of $20million in cash, $40million in new SeriesA
secured notes issued by WPSC, which are collateralized by a second lien
on our tangible and intangible assets other than our accounts
receivable and inventory and our equity interests in our joint ventures
and a third lien on our accounts receivable and inventory, $20million
in new SeriesB secured notes issued by WPSC, which are collateralized
by a fifth lien on our tangible and intangible assets, our equity
interests in our joint ventures, and our accounts receivable and
inventory, and 3,410,000 shares of new common stock of WPC constituting
341% thereof. 41 Table of Contents   
WPC cancelled its then-existing senior notes and related indenture
and its then-existing term notes and the related term loan agreement.     
WPC cancelled all shares of its common stock that existed prior to
the implementation of our plan of reorganization, at which point we
ceased to be a subsidiary of WHX Corporation.     
WPSC entered into a new $250million senior secured term loan
facility, which is guaranteed in part by the Emergency Steel Loan
Guarantee Board, the State of West Virginia, WPC and WPSCs subsidiaries
and is collateralized by a first lien on our tangible and intangible
assets other than accounts receivable and inventory and our equity
interests in our joint ventures and a second lien on our accounts
receivable and inventory. We also entered into a new $225million senior
secured revolving credit facility, which is guaranteed by WPC and WPSCs
subsidiaries and is collateralized by a first lien on our accounts
receivable and inventory and a third lien on our other tangible and
intangible assets and our equity interests in our joint ventures.     
All of our obligations under our $195million debtor-in-possession
credit facility were satisfied in full and discharged.     
WPC and WPSC entered into an agreement with WHX Corporation providing
for, among other things, a $10million capital contribution by WHX
Corporation, the cancellation of approximately $40million in debt owed
by us to WHX Corporation, a $10million unsecured loan from WHX
Corporation and an agreement with respect to our separation from WHX
Corporations employee pension plan.     
WPC and WPSC entered into an agreement with our unionized employees
represented by the United Steelworkers of America USWAwhich modified
our existing labor agreement to provide for, among other things, future
pension arrangements with the United Steelworkers of America and
reductions in our employee-related costs.     
WPC issued 4million shares of its new common stock constituting 40%
thereof for the benefit of USWA retirees in satisfaction of certain
claims under our labor agreement and an additional 1million shares of
its new common stock constituting 10% thereof to or for the benefit of
our salaried employees.     
WPC issued 1,590,000 shares of its new common stock constituting
159% thereof to certain of our creditors in satisfaction of various
unsecured claims, including claims relating to trade debt. There are still several matters pending in the Bankruptcy Court,
including the resolution of disputed unsecured and administrative claims and
certain preference actions and other litigation where we are seeking to
recover monies. Certain of the stock issued pursuant to the Plan of
Reorganization has been reserved for distribution to creditors pending
resolution of certain disputed claims. If those claims are ultimately
allowed in whole or in part by the Bankruptcy Court, the appropriate amount
of stock will be distributed to those claimants; if the claims are
disallowed, the stock will be distributed to other creditors of the same
class, pro rata. To the extent that certain administrative and secured
claims are allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, those claims will be paid in
cash. If and to the extent those claims are allowed as pre-petition
unsecured claims, then those creditors will receive stock, which has been
reserved as described above. In addition, we are the plaintiffs in a number
of preference actions, where we are seeking to recover monies from creditors.
We do not believe that any of these remaining bankruptcy proceedings,
individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on us. 42 Table of Contents Fresh-Start Reporting In accordance with Statement of Position SOP90-7, Financial Reporting
by Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code, the Company adopted
the provisions of fresh-start reporting as of July31, 2003. In adopting the
requirements of fresh-start reporting, the Company engaged an independent
financial advisor to assist in the determination of the enterprise value of the
entity. This value was based upon various valuation methods, including
discounted cash flow methodologies, analysis of comparable steel companies, and
other applicable ratios and economic industry information relevant to the
operations of the Company. The estimated total equity value of the Reorganized
Company aggregating approximately $150million was determined after taking into
account the values of the obligations assumed in connection with the Joint Plan
of Reorganization. The following reconciliation of the Predecessor Companys consolidated
balance sheet as of July31, 2003 to that of the Reorganized Company as of July
31, 2003 was prepared with the adjustments that give effect to the
reorganization and fresh-start reporting. Since the December31, 2003 financial
statements have been prepared as if the Company is a new reporting entity, a
black line has been shown on the financial statements to separate current
results from prior-period information because they are not prepared on a
comparable basis. The adjustments entitled Reorganization reflect the consummation of the
Joint Plan of Reorganization, including the elimination of existing liabilities
subject to compromise, and consolidated shareholders deficit, and to reflect
the aforementioned $150million equity value. The adjustments entitled Fair Value Adjustments reflect the adoption of
fresh-start reporting, including the adjustments to record property and
equipment at its fair value. A reconciliation of fresh-start accounting recorded as of July31, 2003
follows 43 Table of Contents WHEELING-PITTSBURGH CORPORATION

plan. 45 Table of Contents NOTE C Accounting Policies The accounting policies presented below have been followed in preparing
the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Basis of Presentation As a result of the Companys emergence from Chapter11 bankruptcy and the
application of fresh start reporting, consolidated financial statements for the
Company for the periods subsequent to July31, 2003, the effective date of the
Companys plan of reorganization, are referred to as the Reorganized Company.
Such financial statements are not comparable to those for the periods prior to
July31, 2003, which are referred to as the Predecessor Company. A black
line has been drawn in the consolidated financial statements to distinguish,
for accounting purposes, the periods associated with the Reorganized Company
and the Predecessor Company. Aside from the effects of fresh start reporting
and new accounting pronouncements, adopted as of the effective date of the plan
of reorganization, the Reorganized Company follows the same accounting policies
as the Predecessor Company with the exception of depreciation accounting see
below. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all
subsidiary companies. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
are eliminated in consolidation. The Company uses the equity method of
accounting for investments in unconsolidated companies owned 20% or more. Loss Per Share Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to
common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is calculated by
dividing net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding adjusted for potentially dilutive
securities. Pursuant to the plan of reorganization, WPC cancelled all shares of its
common stock that existed prior to the reorganization, at which point we ceased
to be a subsidiary of WHX Corporation. WPC issued ten million shares of its
new common stock in satisfaction of certain claims. The ten million shares
issued included 500,000 shares issued as restricted stock awards which vest
over three years, one-third on each anniversary date. The restricted stock
awards are excluded from the weighted average shares outstanding until such
time as the restrictions lapse. Outstanding stock options and stock grants are
anti-dilutive and excluded from the calculation.

46 Table of Contents Business Segment The Company is primarily engaged in one line of business and has one
industry segment, which is the making, processing and fabricating of steel and
steel products. The Companys products include hot rolled and cold rolled
sheet, and coated products such as galvanized, prepainted and tin mill sheet.
The Company also manufactures a variety of fabricated steel products including
roll formed corrugated roofing, roof deck, form deck, floor deck, culvert,
bridge form and other products used primarily by the construction, highway and
agricultural markets. Through an extensive mix of products, the Company markets to a wide range
of manufacturers, converters and processors. The Companys 10 largest customers
including Wheeling-Nisshin, an affiliate in which the Company has a 357%
ownership interest and Ohio Coatings Company OCC, an affiliate in which the
Company has a 50% ownership interest accounted for approximately 425% of its
net sales in 2003, 504% in 2002 and 439% in 2001. Wheeling-Nisshin
and OCC were the
only customers to account for more than 10% of net sales in 2003.
Wheeling-Nisshin accounted for 163% of net sales in 2003, 156% in 2002 and
146% in 2001. OCC accounted for 112% of net sales in 2003 and 106% of net
sales in 2002. Nittetsu Shoji America accounted for 103% of net sales in
2002. Geographically, the majority of the Companys customers are located
within a 350-mile radius of the Ohio Valley. However, the Company has taken
advantage of its river-oriented production facilities to market via barge into
more distant locations such as the Houston, Texas and St. Louis, Missouri
areas. The Company has acquired regional facilities to service an even broader
geographical area. Revenue Recognition Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when both risk of loss and
title have transferred to the customer, which generally coincides with the time
such products are shipped. Shipping charges billed to customers are recorded
as revenues. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit and highly
liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
by the last-in first-out LIFO method for substantially all inventories. In
2003 and 2002, approximately 98% and 92%, respectively, of inventories are
valued using the LIFO method. Property, Plant and Equipment With the adoption of fresh start reporting, property, plant and equipment
carrying values were stated at fair value as of August1, 2003. Property,
plant and equipment purchased subsequent to the adoption of fresh start
accounting are stated at cost. Prior to July31, 2003, property, plant and
equipment was stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company
periodically evaluates property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. Given the Companys integrated operations, asset
impairment evaluations are generally done on a group basis as that is the
lowest level at which cash flows can be separately identified. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method over the estimated
useful life for financial statement purposes and accelerated methods for income
tax purposes. The estimated useful lives range from 3 to 40years. Interest
cost is capitalized as required on qualifying assets during the assets
acquisition period. Capitalized interest cost is amortized over the estimated
useful life of the underlying asset. Prior to August1, 2003, the Company computed depreciation on the
straight-line or a modified units of production method. Under the modified
units of production method, the straight-line method was adjusted based upon an
activity factor for operating assets. Adjusted annual depreciation was not
less than 60% nor more than 110% of straight-line depreciation. Accumulated
depreciation after adjustment was not less than 75% nor more than 110% of
straight-line depreciation. 47 Table of Contents The Company plans for major repair and maintenance costs. Such costs that
extend the useful life of the asset are separately capitalized in property,
plant and equipment and depreciated over the estimated useful life. All other
repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Software Capitalization
Costs incurred for the development or purchase of internal use software
are capitalized and are amortized over the useful lives of such software, which
is generally five years or less.
Pensions
The Company maintains both tax qualified defined benefit and defined
contribution pension plans. The defined benefit pension obligations for USWA
represented employees are accounted for by the steelworkers pension trust as a
multi-employer plan. As such, the Company records pension expense based on
allocations from the steelworkers pension trust. Defined benefit pension
obligations for salaried employees are recorded on our books. Costs for the
defined contribution plans are being funded currently, with expense being
recorded at the time of funding.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
Recognition is given in the accounts for the income tax effect of temporary
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis
of existing assets and liabilities using the liability method. A valuation
allowance is provided against deferred tax assets where it is considered more
likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefit of such assets.
Environmental Matters
The Company accrues for losses associated with environmental remediation
obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. Accruals
for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are
recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study.
Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or
circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for environmental
remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. Recoveries
of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets
when their receipt is deemed probable.
Goodwill
Goodwill
totaling $300million is included in Deferred Charges and
Other Assets as of December31, 2003. The goodwill was
recorded as part of Fresh Start reporting on
July31, 2003, upon emergence from bankruptcy. As part of the provisions of SOP 90-7, we were required to adopt on July
31, 2003 all accounting guidance that was going to be effective within a
twelve-month period. Management will evaluate the goodwill annually
for impairment to its carrying value.
Restricted Cash
An
escrow account was funded with $112million of the term loan
proceeds upon emergence from bankruptcy for the exclusive use of the
electric arc furnace project. As of December31, 2003, the
restricted cash account totaled $871million.
New Accounting Standards
As part of the provisions of SOP 90-7, we were required to adopt on July
31, 2003 all accounting guidance that was going to be effective within a
twelve-month period.
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFASNo.
143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, effective January1, 2003.
SFAS 143 requires that entities record the fair value of an asset retirement
obligation in the period in which it was incurred. SFAS No143 requires that
an asset retirement cost be capitalized as part of the cost of the related
long-lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and
rational method. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company.
In June2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS 146 addresses financial accounting and
reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies
Emerging Issues Task Force EITFIssue No94-3, Liability Recognition for
Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity
including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. Under EITF Issue 94-3,
a liability for an exit activity was recognized at the date of an entitys
commitment to an exit plan. SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost
associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability
is incurred. SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are
initiated after December31, 2002. SFAS 146 will impact the timing of the
recognition of costs associated with an exit or disposal activity, The Company
has adopted SFAS 146 but has not experienced any activity since its
reorganization that would require application of SFAS 146.
In January2003, the FASB issued SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure. SFAS 148 amends current disclosure
requirements and requires prominent disclosures on both annual and
48 Table of Contents interim financial statements about the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported
results. The Company adopted SFAS 148 which was effective for financial reports
containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after December
15, 2002.
In May2003 the FASB issued SFAS 150 Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. This
Statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures
certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and
equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is
within its scope as liability or an asset in some circumstances. In most cases
these instruments were previously classified as equity. This Statement is
effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May31,
2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period
beginning after June15, 2003. The adoption of this standard did not have an
impact on the Companys financial statements.
In November2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. FIN45,
Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 requires that upon
issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair
value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee. FIN 45 also requires
additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial
statements about the obligations associated with guarantees issued. The
disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or
annual periods ending after December15, 2002. The recognition and measurement
provisions are effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or
modified after December31, 2002. The adoption did not have a material impact
on the Company.
In January2003, the FASB issued FIN 46 revised December2003,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No51,
which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest
entities that do not have sufficient equity investment to permit the entity to
finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from
other parties or whose equity investors lack characteristics of a controlling
financial interest. The Interpretation provides guidance related to identifying
variable interest entities and determining whether such entities should be
consolidated. It also provides guidance related to the initial and subsequent
measurement of assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests in newly
consolidated variable interest entities and requires disclosures for both the
primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and other beneficiaries of
the entity. FIN 46 must be applied to all entities subject to this
Interpretation as of March31, 2004. However, prior to the required application
of this Interpretation, FIN 46 must be applied to those entities that are
considered to be special-purpose entities as of December31, 2003. There was no
financial statement impact from the application of this Interpretation at
December31, 2003.
NOTE DPensions, Other Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits
Pension Programs
The Company provides defined contribution pension programs for both hourly
and salaried employees, and prior to August12, 1997, also provided a defined
contribution pension program for USWA-represented employees. These tax
qualified defined contribution plans provide, in the case of hourly employees,
an increasing Company contribution per hour worked based on the age of its
employees. A similar tax qualified plan for salaried employees provides
defined Company contributions based on a percentage of compensation dependent
upon age and in certain cases age and service of its employees. The Company
also established a supplemental defined benefit pension plan for its salaried
employees.
As of December31, 2003, $10million of fully vested funds are held in
trust for benefits earned under the WCC hourly defined contribution pension plans
and $369million of fully vested funds are held in trust for benefits earned
under the salaried employees defined contribution plan. Approximately 421% of
the assets are invested in equities, 161% are in fixed income investments, and
412% in other hedge funds. The balance is in cash and cash equivalents.
All plan assets are invested by professional investment managers.
All pension provisions charged against income totaled $33million, $19
million, $38million and $49million in the 5months ended December31, 2003,
the 7months ended July31, 2003, in 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Defined Benefit Plans
The Company established a defined benefit pension plan for
USWA-represented employees pursuant to a labor agreement ratified in August
1997. The plan includes individual participant accounts of USWA-represented
employees from the hourly-defined contribution plan and merges the assets of
those accounts into the defined benefit plan. Prior to
49 Table of Contents that date, benefits were provided through a defined contribution plan, the
WPSC Retirement Security Plan Retirement Security Plan.
The defined benefit pension plan covers employees represented by the USWA.
The plan also includes individual participant accounts from the Retirement
Security Plan. The assets of the Retirement Security Plan were merged into the
Defined Benefit Pension Plan. Since the plan includes the account balances
from the Retirement Security Plan, the plan includes both defined benefit and
defined contribution features. The gross benefit, before offsets, is
calculated based on years of service and the current benefit multiplier under
the plan. This gross amount is then offset for benefits payable from the
Retirement Security Plan and benefits payable by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation PBGC from previously terminated plans. Individual employee
accounts established under the Retirement Security Plan are maintained until
retirement. Upon retirement, the account balances are converted into monthly
benefits that serve as an offset to the gross benefit, as described above.
Aggregate account balances held in trust in individual employee accounts which
will be available upon retirement to offset the gross benefit at December31,
2003 totaled $1413million.
In 1998 the Company established a supplemental defined benefit plan
covering its salaried employees employed as of January31, 1998, which provides
a guaranteed minimum benefit based on years of service and compensation. The
gross benefit from this plan is offset by the annuitized value of the defined
contribution plan account balance and any benefits payable from the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation from the previously terminated defined benefit
pension plan.
As a result of the reorganization as of August1, 2003 and per agreement
with the PBGC and the USWA, all of the Companys pension plans which were a
part of the WHX Pension Plan were frozen. As a result of this action, the
Company adopted a supplemental defined benefit pension plan to cover its
salaried employees. This plan replicates the benefits provided by the WHX
Pension Plan and is offset by benefits accrued under the WHX Pension Plan as of
July31, 2003.
In addition, per the agreement with the USWA, the Companys USWA
represented employees became participants in the Steelworker Pension Trust
SPTas of August1, 2003. The SPT is a multi-employer pension plan with
monthly Company contributions based on hours worked by employees. The Company
contributions as defined in the labor agreement provide for $925 for hours
worked from August1, 2003 through February9, 2004. Beginning on February10,
2004 through June9, 2005 the hourly contribution will be $117 and beginning
on June10, 2005 and continuing through the balance of the term of the labor
agreement the hourly contribution will be $208. The labor agreement also
provides for 2 lump sum payments to be made. The first, due as of August1,
2003, was $1,500 times the number of USWA employees as of August1, 2003 and
the second, due as of July1, 2004 is $1,300 times the same number of
employees.
In 1998, WHX merged WPCs defined benefit pension plan with those of its
wholly-owned Handy Harman subsidiary. The merger eliminated WPC cash funding
obligations estimated in excess of $1350million. WPC pension expense was
allocated by the common parent and totaled $09million in 2001. No pension
expense was allocated by WHX to WPC in 2003 or 2002. Effective May29, 2001,
the Company entered into an agreement with WHX, whereby WHX agreed not to
charge the Company for any pension expense through and including the effective
date of the plan of reorganization. See Note A Bankruptcy and
Reorganization.
Other Postretirement Benefits
The traditional medical and life insurance benefits that were provided to
past retirees was terminated on October1, 2003. Pursuant to the new labor
agreement, which we entered into in connection with our plan of reorganization,
past retirees now receive medical and life insurance benefits under a VEBA
trust. Future retirees under the new labor agreement will be covered by a
medical and life insurance program similar to that of active employees.
Eligible pensioners and surviving spouses shall be required to make monthly
contributions for medical and prescription drug coverage. Because these
benefits provided by us will be paid in the future over what could be many
years, we use an independent actuary to help us estimate the accrued liability
at each year-end balance sheet date. The two most significant assumptions used
in determining the liability are the projected medical cost trend rate and the
discount rate.
We estimate the escalation trend in medical costs based on historical rate
experience in our plans and through consultation with health care specialists.
We have assumed an initial escalation rate of 825% in calculating
the 2003 obligation. This rate is
assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of 475% in 2008 and remain
at that level for all future years.
50 Table of Contents The discount rate applied to our OPEB obligations is based on an estimate
of the current interest rate at which our OPEB obligations could be settled at
the balance sheet date. In estimating this rate, we consider high quality bond
rates and the expected payout period of our OPEB obligations. Based on this
evaluation, we lowered the discount rate used to measure our OPEB obligation at
December31, 2003 from 65% to 6%. The amounts accrued at December31, included
the following components.

For measurement purposes, medical costs are assumed to increase at annual
rates as stated above and decline gradually to 475% in 2008 and beyond. The
health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the costs
and obligation reported. A 1% increase in the health care cost trend rate would
result in approximate increases in the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation of $192million. A 1% decrease in the health care cost trend rate
would result in approximate decreases in the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation of $167million. A 1% increase in the health care
cost trend rate would result in approximate increases in
postretirement benefit expenses of $18million. A 1% decrease
in the health care cost trend rate would result in approximate
decreases in postretirement benefit expenses of $15million.
401k Plan
Effective January1, 1994, the Company began matching salaried employee
contributions to the 401k plan with shares of WHXs Common Stock. Until
November30, 2000, the Company matched 50% of the employees contributions. The
employer contribution was limited to a maximum of 3% of an employees salary.
As of November30, 2000, the Company terminated the employer matching
contribution benefit. On August1, 2003, the Company contributed 500,000
shares to its salaried employees through its 401k plan, pursuant to its plan
of reorganization. At December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the 401k plan held
124,195 shares, 165,645 shares and 542,695 shares of WHX Common Stock,
respectively.
Postemployment Benefits
The Company provides benefits to former or inactive employees after
employment but before retirement. Those benefits include, among others,
disability, severance and workers compensation. The assumed discount rate
used to measure the benefit liability was 60% at December31, 2003 and 65% at
December31, 2002. At December31, 2003, Other Employee Benefit Liabilities
totaled $311million. At December31, 2002, liabilities of $11million and
$167million were included in Other Employee Benefit Liabilities and
Liabilities Subject to Compromise Other Liabilities, respectively.
Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act
The Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 the Act created a
new United Mine Workers of America postretirement medical and death benefit
plan to replace two existing plans which had developed significant deficits.
The Act assigns companies the remaining benefit obligations for former
employees and beneficiaries, and a pro rata allocation of benefits related to
unassigned beneficiaries orphans. The Companys obligation under the Act
relates to its previous ownership of coal mining operations.
In 2003 the courts determined that certain retirees and dependents were
not the responsibility of WPSC. In the fourth quarter of 2003, WPSC received
net cash proceeds of $72million for premiums previously paid which was
recorded as income at that time.
At December31, 2003, the actuarially determined liability discounted at
60%, covering 40 assigned retirees and dependents and 25 orphans, totaled $29
million. At December31, 2002, the actuarially determined liability discounted
at 65%, covering 348 assigned retirees and dependents and 157 orphans, totaled
$104million.

As a result of the implementation of the Companys plan of reorganization,
various differences giving rise to deferred income tax liabilities or assets
were revalued. Additionally, in conjunction with the Companys emergence from
bankruptcy during 2003, certain tax attributes including net operating losses
and tax credits were reduced or eliminated in exchange for tax-free treatment
of cancellation of indebtedness income. The revaluation and/or reduction of
deferred tax asset and liability components amounted to a net reduction of tax
benefit amounting to approximately $1907million for which a valuation
allowance had been previously established. Subject to certain rules relating to the use of tax attributes upon
emergence from bankruptcy, the Company has the ability to use such attributes 
namely net operating losses without restriction. However, due to
uncertainties surrounding future realization of these benefits, a full
valuation allowance remains in place against the Companys net deferred tax
asset. To the extent that such a benefit is capable of being utilized in the
future, the recognition of the benefit will first go to reduce intangible
assets, if any, and then as a direct addition to equity. During the
post-emergence period of 2003, the Companys valuation allowance increased
$299million largely due to the increase in net operating losses for which
uncertainty exists as to their realizability. The statute of limitations has expired for years through 1999. Federal
tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service through 1997.
Additionally, while the Company is no longer affiliated with WHX Corporation,
the Companys former parent, the Companys tax attributes could be impacted by
an audit of WHX for those years in which the Company was still a part of the
WHX affiliated group. Management believes it has adequately provided for all
taxes on income. 54 Table of Contents Note FInventories

The basis of property, plant and equipment was revalued to fair market
value in accordance with SOP 90-7. The overall write-down of property, plant
and equipment was approximately $1333million at July31, 2003. Depreciation expense calculated using the straight-line method amounted
to $101million at December31, 2003. Prior to reorganization, the Company
utilized the modified units of production method of depreciation which
correlated a time factor to the physical wear and tear of the equipment based
upon the level of raw steel production. For the periods ended July31, 2003,
December31, 2002 and December31, 2001, depreciation adjustments under the
modified units of production method reduced straight-line depreciation by $23
million, $09million and $18million respectively. As
of December31, 2003 and December31, 2002, the Company had two capital leases in the amount
of $81million and $71million respectively. These
capital leases were classified as long-term debt in 2003 and as Debt in Liabilities Subject to
Compromise in 2002. Note HLiabilities Subject to Compromise and Pre-petition Long Term Debt The principal categories of claims that were classified as liabilities
subject to compromise under the Companys reorganization proceedings are
identified below. These liabilities included substantially all the current and
non-current liabilities of the Company as of November16, 2000, the date the
Chapter11 petition was filed. 55 Table of Contents

No estimate of fair value was available for December31, 2002. As a result of the bankruptcy filing, principal and interest payments may
not be made on pre-petition debt without Bankruptcy Court approval or until
reorganization plan defining the repayment terms has been confirmed. For the
seven months ended July31, 2003 and the years ended December31, 2002 and
2001, interest not paid or charged to earnings totaled $ 169million, $299
million and $316million, respectively. Such interest was not being accrued
since it was not probable that it would be treated as an allowed claim. 9% Senior Notes Due 2007 and Term Loan On November26, 1997 the Company issued $275million principal amount of
9% Senior Notes. Interest on the 9% Senior Notes was payable
semi-annually on May15 and November15 of each year. The Senior Notes were to
mature on November15, 2007. The 9% Senior Notes were fully and
unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several and senior basis by the
guarantors, which consisted of the Companys present and future operating
subsidiaries. On November26, 1997 the Company entered into a Term Loan Agreement with
DLJ Capital Funding Inc., as syndication agent pursuant to which it borrowed
$75million. The Companys obligations under the Term Loan Agreement were
guaranteed by its present and future operating subsidiaries. All of the pre-petition liabilities disclosed above were settled as part
of our plan of reorganization, which was approved by the court and became
effective August1, 2003 Note ILong Term Debt 250 Million Term Loan In connection with our plan of reorganization, WPSC entered into a
five-year $250million senior secured term loan facility with a bank group led
by Royal Bank of Canada as administrative agent. The term loan is arranged in
three 56 Table of Contents tranches
with varying degrees of risk and interest rates. Interest on
borrowings is calculated based on either LIBOR or the prime rate
using spreads as defined for each tranche in the agreement. The
blended rate of interest was approximately 38% at
December31, 2003. The term loan is to be repaid beginning in the third
quarter of 2004 through the first quarter of 2008 in quarterly installments of
$625million with a final payment of $15625million due at maturity. A federal government guarantee from the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee
Board, also referred to as the Steel Board, covers 85% or $2125million of the
$25million first tranche of the term loan held by Royal Bank of Canada, and
95% or approximately $19875million of the approximately $209million second
tranche of the term loan held by various lenders. The Steel Board guarantee is
a guarantee of principal only. The Steel Board guarantee terminates only if the
administrative agent fails to make a payment demand within thirty days from the
date of any payment default or if any lender transfers its interest in the term
loan facility contrary to provisions of the appropriate sections of the
guarantee. The Steel Board guarantee expires thirteen years after the closing
of the term loan facility, or eight years after scheduled maturity. The
remaining 5% of the second tranche of the term loan is backed by an
unconditional guarantee from the State of West Virginia. Additionally, the term
loan is guaranteed by WPC and WPSCs subsidiaries. Of the approximately $158
million third tranche of the term loan, approximately $38million is held by
Danieli Corporation as a vendor/supplier to WPSC and approximately $12million
is held by the State of Ohio through the Ohio Department of Development. The
term loan is collateralized by a first lien on all of our tangible and
intangible assets other than accounts receivable and inventory and our equity
interests in our joint ventures, and a second lien on our accounts receivable
and inventory. A portion of the term loan was used to finance our plan of reorganization
by paying off our debtor-in-possession credit facility and paying other cash
claims under our plan of reorganization. In addition, $112million of the term
loan has been placed in a restricted cash account relating to the construction
of an electric arc furnace. Pursuant to the provisions of the term loan credit
agreement, we are subject to, and are currently in compliance with, various
affirmative covenants customary for a debt financing of this type, including
provision of financial reports, compliance with payment and contractual
obligations and requirements of law, maintenance of existence and property,
maintenance of insurance, and compliance with the terms and conditions of the
Steel Board guarantee and the State of West Virginia guarantee. In addition, we
are subject to, and are currently in compliance with, various negative
covenants. 225 Million Revolving Credit Facility In connection with our plan of reorganization, WPSC entered into a
three-year $225million senior secured revolving credit facility with a bank
group arranged by Royal Bank of Canada and General Electric Capital
Corporation Capital Markets Group. The
revolving credit facility is guaranteed by WPC and WPSCs subsidiaries. The
revolving credit facility is collateralized by a first lien on our accounts
receivable and inventory and a third lien on our other tangible and intangible
assets and our equity interest in our joint ventures. The revolving credit
facility is to be available at agreed advance rates, subject to our audited
accounts receivable and inventory borrowing base. The revolving
credit facility requires the maintenance of a minimum $50
million borrowing availability. Failure to maintain such minimum
availability could result in a covenant
violation. Interest on borrowings is calculated based on either LIBOR
or the prime rate using spreads based on facility borrowing
availability as defined in the agreement. The blended rate of
interest was approximately 49% at December31, 2003. At December31, 2003, we had borrowed approximately
$793million under the revolving credit facility. At December31, 2003 the
Company had $67million of net excess availability over the required minimum
$50million availability. Based on its projections of future availability under
the revolving credit facility, the Company believes that it will remain in
compliance with the required minimum $50million availability. Pursuant to the provisions of the revolving loan agreement, we are subject
to, and are currently in compliance with, various affirmative covenants and
negative covenants, including financial condition covenants, which are
substantially similar to many of those contained in the term loan credit
agreement as described above. 40 Million SeriesA Notes On August1, 2003, pursuant to our plan of reorganization, WPSC issued new
SeriesA secured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $40million in
settlement of claims under our bankruptcy proceedings. The SeriesA notes were
issued under an indenture between WPSC and Bank One, N.A., as trustee. The
SeriesA notes mature on August1, 2011 and they have no fixed amortization,
meaning that no payment of principal shall be required until such notes become
due. The SeriesA notes bear interest at a rate of 5% per annum until July1,
2008. Thereafter, such notes bear interest at a rate of 8% per annum. 57 Table of Contents The SeriesA notes are collateralized by a second lien on our tangible and
intangible assets other than accounts receivable and inventory and our equity
interests in our joint ventures and a third lien on our accounts receivable and
inventory. Until August1, 2008, fifty percent of the payments to WPSC from the
Wheeling-Nisshin and OCC joint ventures, in respect of loans to, or equity
interest in, such joint ventures, will be applied to payments on the SeriesA
notes. Thereafter, one hundred percent of such payments from the joint ventures
to WPSC will be applied to the SeriesA notes. However, WPSC must pay cash
interest of at least 2% per annum. In the event that at any time the payments
from the joint ventures are not adequate to pay all interest then owing, or if
WPSC is not in compliance with the terms of the term loan facility and/or the
revolving credit facility, the remaining portion of the principal upon which
cash interest has not been paid will receive payment-in-kind interest at a rate
of 8% per annum during the first five years of the term of the SeriesA notes,
and at a rate of 10% per annum thereafter. In addition, the SeriesA notes are subrogated to the first lien and other
rights of the term loan facility and any refinancing of the scheduled amounts
due hereunder to the extent of $142million plus any funds received by WPSC
from WPC, Wheeling-Nisshin and OCC subsequent to April15, 2003 and not
utilized to pay the SeriesA notes. We are subject to, and are currently in compliance with, various
affirmative covenants and negative covenants set forth in the SeriesA note
indenture. 20 Million SeriesB Notes On August1, 2003, pursuant to our plan of reorganization, WPSC issued new
SeriesB secured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $20million in
settlement of claims under our bankruptcy proceedings. The SeriesB notes were
issued under an indenture between WPSC and Bank One, N.A., as trustee. The
SeriesB notes mature on August1, 2010 and they have no fixed amortization,
meaning that no payment of principal shall be required until such notes become
due. The SeriesB notes bear interest at a rate of 6% per annum to the extent
interest is paid in cash. WPSC must pay cash interest of at least 2% per annum.
Payment of cash interest in excess of 2% per annum is dependent upon our
remaining in compliance with our new credit agreements and the SeriesA notes.
In the event that we are not in compliance with the terms of the term loan
facility, the revolving credit facility and/or the SeriesA notes, or our cash
flow is insufficient to cover any or all of the interest, the remaining portion
of the principal upon which cash interest has not been paid will receive
payment-in-kind interest at a rate of 8% per annum. In addition, the SeriesB notes are collateralized by a fifth lien on our
tangible and intangible assets, including our equity interests in our joint
ventures and our accounts receivable and inventory. We are subject to, and are currently in compliance with, various
affirmative and negative covenants under the SeriesB note indenture, which are
substantially similar to many of those contained in the SeriesA note
indenture. 10 Million Unsecured Note On August1, 2003, pursuant to our plan of reorganization, WPSC issued an
unsecured note in the aggregate principal amount of $10million to WHX
Corporation, referred to as the WHX note. The WHX note matures in 8years and
has no fixed amortization, meaning that no payment of principal shall be
required until such note becomes due. The WHX note bears interest at a rate of
6% per annum. Such note is subordinated in right of payment to our credit
agreements, the SeriesA notes and the SeriesB notes. Certain Other Obligations In connection with the implementation of our plan of reorganization, we
reached agreements with various parties to defer payments of indebtedness and
reduce costs in order to preserve liquidity upon emergence from bankruptcy.
These agreements include   
Modification and assumption agreement between WPSC and Danieli
Corporation - This agreement modifies an agreement between WPSC and
Danieli Corporation, dated July6, 2000, pursuant to which WPSC agreed
to purchase from Danieli Corporation certain roll-changing equipment.
Under the original agreement, WPSC owed approximately $736million to
Danieli Corporation. Pursuant to the modified agreement, WPSC paid
Danieli Corporation approximately $236million. Approximately $38
million of the balance of the amount owed to Danieli Corporation has
been converted into a portion of the secured term loans under our term
loan facility that 58 Table of Contents   
is not secured by the Steel Board. The balance of the
amount owed to Danieli Corporation has been converted into a promissory
note. In addition, WPSC agreed to pay Danieli Corporation approximately
$258million of which approximately $96 thousand has been paid and the
balance of which is to be paid in progress payments as work is completed
in 2004 to complete the roll-changing project and for rehabilitation,
storage and other costs of Danieli Corporation.     
Loan modification agreement between WPSC and the Ohio Department of
Development Under this agreement we made a $20million partial
prepayment of the $6985million owed by WPSC to the Ohio Department of
Development pursuant to a loan, dated as of January18, 2002, from the
Ohio Department of Development and we were granted a two-year deferral
of $4985million of such loan at an interest rate of 3% per annum.     
Loan agreement between WPSC and the State of West Virginia
- - In
connection with WPSCs repayment of a $5million loan from the West
Virginia Development Office, WPSC has entered into a $65million loan
agreement with the State of West Virginia. The loan has a five-year term
and bears interest at a rate of approximately 44% per annum.     
Agreement amongst WPSC, Itabira Rio Doce Company, Ltd. and Rio Doce
Limited This agreement provides for repayment, in equal monthly
installments over a period not to exceed eighteen months from May1,
2003, of
WPSCs $51million deferred payment obligation under a certain iron ore
sales agreement, dated October1, 2001. Shown below are the long-term debt obligations as of December31, 2003 and

Pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding MOU, WHX provided $50
million in secured loans to the Company during the fourth quarter of 2001 to
increase liquidity and sustain continued operations. The loans bear interest
at the rate of 6% per annum and will mature on the earlier of the a
substantial consummation of a Plan of Reorganization, btermination of the
MOU, or cDecember31, 2002. Payment was not made on December31, 2002, but
the loan became part of the reorganization cancellation of debt. Pursuant to a
negotiated agreement among the USWA, WHX and the Company in January2002, the
Company received loans in the amount of $70million and $50million from the
states of Ohio and West Virginia, respectively. The West Virginia loan was paid
off in reorganization. The Ohio loan was paid down to $50million in
reorganization and the balance is due August1, 2005. Principal
amounts of long-term debt in thousands maturing in each of the next five years is as follows:
2004, $15,197; 2005, $31,058; 2006, $26,133; 2007, $25,730; and 2008, $169,599. 59 Table of Contents Interest Cost Aggregate interest costs on debt and amounts capitalized during the three

NOTE JRelated Party Transactions The Company regularly sells steel product at prevailing market prices to
Unimast Incorporated Unimast and PCC, wholly-owned subsidiaries of WHX.
During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company shipped $00million, $05million and
$22million, respectively of steel product to Unimast. In August2002, WHX
sold its interest in Unimast to an unrelated party. During 2003, 2002 and
2001, the Company shipped $140million, $208million and $70million,
respectively of steel product to PCC. Amounts due the Company from Unimast at
December31, 2003 and 2002 were $00million and $01million, respectively.
Amounts due the Company from PCC at December31, 2003 and 2002 were $15
million and $20million, respectively. WHX provided funds for the purchase of
natural gas during 2001. At December31, 2003 the Company did not owe WHX any
money for gas purchased. Pursuant to our plan of reorganization which became effective August1,
2003 the Company ceased to be a subsidiary of WHX. WHX has no ownership
interest in WPC after the effective date. NOTE KCommitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters Prior to confirmation of our plan of reorganization effective August1,
2003, we settled all pre-petition environmental liability claims made by state
Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and federal USEPAenvironmental
regulatory agencies. Consequently, we believe we have settled and/or
discharged environmental liability for any CERCLA
Superfund sites, pre-petition stipulated penalties related to active
consent decrees, or other pre-petition regulatory enforcement actions. Currently, we estimate that stipulated penalties and fines for
post-petition events and activities through December31, 2003
total $1,931,500.
These claims arise from instances in which we exceeded post-petition consent decree terms,
including: a $234,500 related to a July1991 USEPA consent decree for water
discharges to the Ohio River; b $75,000 related to a September20, 1999 Ohio
EPA consent decree for our coke oven gas desulfurization facility; and c
$1,622,000 related to a January30, 1996 USEPA consent decree for our coke oven
gas desulfurization facility. In September2000, we entered into a consent order with the West Virginia
Department of Environmental Protection wherein we agreed to remove contaminated
sediments from the bed of the Ohio River. We spent approximately $14million
on these activities in 2002 and an additional $400,000 in 2003. During removal
activities in 2003, we discovered a broader area of contaminated sediments. We
identified the spatial limits of these contaminated sediments and estimate
their removal costs at $40million. 60 Table of Contents We are under a final administrative order issued by the USEPA in June1998
to conduct a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Facility Investigation to
determine the nature and extent of soil and groundwater contamination at our
Coke Plant in Follansbee, WV. USEPA has approved our investigation Work plan,
and field activities are scheduled for 2004. Following our investigation we
will to perform a Corrective Measures Study to determine possible remedial
measures. We expect some remediation measures will be necessary and could
commence within the next three to five years. We have reserved approximately
$52million for such remediation measures. However, until the field
investigation is completed and the EPA approves our remediation plan, the full
extent and cost of remediation cannot be ascertained. The USEPA conducted a multimedia inspection of our Steubenville, Mingo
Junction, Yorkville and Martins Ferry, Ohio and Follansbee, West Virginia
facilities in March and June1999. The inspection covered all environmental
regulations applicable to these plants. Many of the issues have been resolved
and settled prior to emergence from Chapter11 bankruptcy. We have reserved
$14million for resolution of outstanding issues. Capital expenditures for environmental projects totaled $17million in
2002 and $10 in 2003. We estimate capital expenditures for environmental
projects to be $36 for 2004, $93 for 2005 and $70 for 2006. However, due to
the possibility of unanticipated factual or regulatory developments, the amount
and timing of future capital expenditures may vary substantially from such
estimates. Non-current accrued environmental liabilities totaled $181million in
2002 and $147million in 2003. These accruals were based on all available
information to the Company. As new information becomes available, including
information provided by third parties and new or changing environmental
regulations, the liabilities are reviewed and the accruals are adjusted
accordingly on a quarterly basis. We believe we have adequately provided for
our present environmental liabilities using our best judgment of known issues. Commitments The Company entered into a 15-year take-or-pay contract in 1999 that was
amended in 2003 that requires the Company to purchase oxygen, nitrogen and
argon each month with a minimum monthly charge of approximately $06million,
subject to escalation clauses. Payments for deliveries of oxygen totaled $93
million in 2003, $70million in 2002 and $75million in 2001. The Company entered into a 20-year take-or-pay contract in 1999, that was
amended in 2003 that requires the Company to purchase steam and electricity
each month or pay a minimum monthly charge of approximately $04million. A
variable portion of the contract is calculated as $375 times the number of
tons of iron produced each month with an agreed to minimum of 3,000 tons per
day. Payments for deliveries of steam and electricity totaled $88million in
2003, $138million in 2002 and $146million in 2001. If the Company elects to
terminate the contract early, as of December31, 2003, a maximum termination
payment of $370million would be required. In 2004, the Company entered into a take-or-pay contract to purchase coal
each month with a minimum monthly charge of approximately $16million. The
term of the contract expires on December31, 2007, while the Company has the
sole option to terminate the contract on or after January1, 2006. After such
date, the pricing will be subject to market conditions with a cap collar.
Payments for deliveries of coal totaled $118million in 2003, $164million in
2002 and $73million in 2001. As of December31, 2003, if the Company elects
to terminate the contract, a maximum termination payment of $374million would
be required. 61 Table of Contents NOTE LOther Income
