Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As required by Rule13a-15c under the Exchange Act, the Companys management evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on that evaluation, the Companys management concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2009 was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We have excluded certain elements of the internal control over financial reporting of American Dental
Partners of Florida, LLC, a 100% owned subsidiary, from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2009 because it was acquired by us in a business combination during fiscal 2009. The excluded elements
represent controls over accounts of approximately 8% of consolidated assets and less than 1% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December31, 2009. American Dental Partners of Florida, LLC will be included in our fiscal 2010 evaluation.
Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2009 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in this Annual Report on Form10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To Board of Directors and Stockholders of American Dental Partners, Inc., In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of American Dental Partners,
Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company at December31, 2009 and December31, 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2009 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2009, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing in Item8.
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A
companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As described in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Christie Dental, a 100% owned subsidiary, from its assessment of internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2009 because it was acquired by the Company in a business combination in 2009. The excluded elements represent controls over accounts of approximately 8% of consolidated assets and less than 1% of
consolidated net revenues for the year ended December31, 2009. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, MA March12, 2010

AMERICAN DENTAL PARTNERS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Years Ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 1 Description of Business
American Dental Partners, Inc. the Company is a leading provider of business services, dental facilities
and support staff to multidisciplinary dental group practices in selected markets throughout the United States. The Company customarily acquires selected assets of the dental practices with which it affiliates and enters into long-term service
agreements with professional corporations, professional associations or service corporations that are not owned by the Company. The Company is responsible for providing all services necessary for the administration of the non-clinical aspects of the
dental operations, while the affiliated dental practices are responsible for providing dental care to patients. Services provided to the affiliated practices include providing assistance with organizational planning and development; recruiting,
retention and training programs; quality assurance initiatives; facilities development and management; employee benefits administration; procurement; information systems and practice technology; marketing and payor relations; and financial planning,
reporting and analysis. The Company operates in one segment. 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include the accounts of American
Dental Partners, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries and its Arizonas Tooth Doctor for Kids Arizona Tooth Doctor subsidiary, which is owned 85% by the Company. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Management has determined that, based on the provisions of its service agreements, the Company is not required to consolidate the financial statements of the affiliated practices that are affiliated with the Company by means of a
long-term service agreement with its own. Use of Estimates The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Companys carrying
amount of accounts receivable, net, requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding the collectability of accounts receivable in its consolidated financial statements. The Companys affiliation and acquisition transactions
typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the Company will incur. The determination of the value of these intangible assets requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements. The Company and the affiliated practices maintain insurance coverage for various business activities. Certain of the coverages have retentions that
require the Company to make estimates and assumptions regarding losses below applicable retention levels. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Reclassifications Other
operating expenses of $1,478,000 and $205,000 for 2008 and 2007, respectively, have been reclassified to salaries and benefits to conform to the 2009 presentation. 
52 Table of Contents AMERICAN DENTAL PARTNERS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued For the Years Ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 
2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company believes the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items.
The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair value because the interest rates are approximate rates at which similar types of borrowing arrangements could be obtained by the Company. Net Revenue The
Companys net revenue represents primarily reimbursement of expenses and fees charged to the affiliated practices pursuant to the terms of service agreements. Additionally, the Companys net revenue includes the amounts from patient
revenue of Arizona Tooth Doctor, its dental benefits third-party administrator fees and its dental laboratory fees. The
Companys net revenue from the reimbursement of expenses is accounted for on an accrual basis and is recognized when these expenses are incurred by the affiliated practices. Reimbursement of expenses includes costs incurred by the Company for
the operation and administration of the dental facilities, which include salaries and benefits for non-dentist personnel working at the dental facilities; lab fees, dental supplies and office occupancy costs of the dental facilities, depreciation
related to the fixed assets at the dental facilities, and other expenses such as professional fees, marketing costs and general and administrative expenses. In December 2007, the Company entered into a litigation settlement agreement pursuant to which the service agreement with PDG, P.A. PDG, the former affiliated practice at Park Dental, was
terminated effective December31, 2007 and the Company transferred the operating assets of 25 of the 31 Park Dental facilities and the Park Dental trade name to PDG. The Company also entered into a transition services agreement with
PDG to provide interim management services for a period of nine months through September30, 2008 for $19,000,000, which was recorded as $10,000,000 in net revenue in 2008, which reflects the estimated fair value of the service, and $9,000,000
as an offset to the litigation loss in 2007. In 2008, the Company concluded the transition services agreement with PDG and recorded fees as other revenue pursuant to the transition services agreement. Inventories Inventories
consist primarily of dental supplies and are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined under the weighted average method. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are recorded
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are 30-40 years for buildings, 3-12 years for equipment, 5-7 years for furniture and fixtures, and the remaining life of the lease for leasehold
improvements. Development costs incurred for computer software development or obtained for internal use are capitalized and
53 Table of Contents AMERICAN DENTAL PARTNERS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued For the Years Ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 
2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
amortized in accordance with authoritative guidance for accounting for costs of computer software development. Capitalized software costs are amortized over ten years once a determination is made
that the software is deemed fit for operational use. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company has intangible assets, including goodwill and other identifiable intangibles assets, which are the result of affiliation
transactions and acquisitions of businesses. The initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of useful lives at the time of affiliation or acquisition involve the use of management judgments and estimates.
These estimates are based on, among other factors, reviews of projected future income, cash flows, statutory regulations and, in certain instances, input from accredited valuation consultants. At December31, 2009, goodwill and intangible
assets were $267,425,000 and represented 72% of the Companys total assets, with goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets representing 32% of the Companys intangible assets and definite-lived intangible assets related to service
agreements representing 68% of the Companys intangible assets. To the extent any intangible asset is impaired, its
carrying value will be written down to its implied fair value and a charge will be made to earnings. An impairment charge could materially and adversely affect the Companys operating results and financial condition. Goodwill results from the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition over the estimated fair value of the tangible and intangible assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company performs impairment assessment annually and compares the fair value to the carrying value of each reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the Companys
average cost of funds. If impairment were determined, an appropriate adjustment to goodwill to reduce the assets carrying value would be made. The Company has not recorded any impairment charges on goodwill as of December31, 2009.
The Company tested goodwill for impairment as of October1, 2009, which testing included various scenarios with varying
revenue, expense and capital investment assumptions, and determined there was no impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. The Companys dental benefits third party administrator historically earned a significant percentage of its revenue from administering capitated managed care plans.As a result of the continuing
decline of capitated managed care plans in the dental profession, the Companys third party administrator has been developing additional product offerings, including dental referral plans, to offset the decline of this part of the
Companys business.In 2009, the Companys third party administrator experienced a reduction of revenue and incurred an operating loss as a result of the continuing decline of administrative services for capitated managed care
plans.Based on its business plan and future projections, the Company determined the fair value of this business reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of $2,266,000 at October1, 2009.If this business plan is not successfully
executed or projected financial results are not achieved, the Company may need to record an impairment charge related to the carrying value of the goodwill of this reporting unit. The Companys affiliations with dental group practices by means of service agreements are not business combinations, and as such, do not result in recognition of goodwill. The
Company recognizes capitalized service agreement costs, which are accounted for as definite-lived intangible assets acquired in other than a business combination and recorded at fair value. In determining the fair value of a service agreement
recognized in
54 Table of Contents AMERICAN DENTAL PARTNERS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued For the Years Ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 
2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
connection with an affiliation, the Company estimates the timing, amount and value of future expected cash flows. The service agreements have contractual terms of 40 years, but the asset is
amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 25 years. In the event a service agreement is terminated, the related affiliated practice is required, at the Companys option in nearly all instances, to purchase the remaining unamortized
balance of intangible assets at the current book value. Customer relationship intangible assets associated with the
acquisition of dental laboratories are amortized on a straight-line basis over 15 years. Customer relationship intangible assets associated with the acquisition of Arizona Tooth Doctor are amortized over five years on an accelerated basis.
Non-compete agreements associated with the acquisition of Christie Dental Practice Group, P.L., which was acquired in 2009, are amortized over five years. Trade names are accounted for as indefinite-lived and not amortized. The Company performs an impairment test on indefinite lived intangible and definite-lived intangible assets when facts and circumstances
exist that would suggest that the intangible assets may be impaired. The test requires comparing the undiscounted net cash flows of the asset to its carrying value. If impairment were determined, an appropriate adjustment to the intangible asset
would be made to reduce the assets carrying value to fair value. Fair value is determined by calculating the projected discounted operating net cash flows of the asset using a discount rate reflecting the Companys average cost of funds.
The Company has not recorded any impairment charges or write-downs on definite-lived intangibles as of December31, 2009. Insurance
The Company maintains various insurance coverages for its business, including property-casualty, business interruption,
workers compensation and general liability, among others. In addition, the affiliated practices are required to maintain, or cause to be maintained, professional liability insurance with the Company as a named insured. Certain of the
Companys insurances are reinsured by a wholly-owned captive insurance company licensed in Vermont. Several of these insurance programs have retention levels in which the Company and its captive insurance company are financially obligated for
insured losses below certain financial thresholds before the insurer is financially obligated for insured losses. The Company and its captive insurance company maintain reserves for certain of these programs, which are based upon estimates provided
by third-party actuaries or by individual case-basis valuations. Amounts accrued for workers compensation insurance, including estimates for losses below retention levels, were $994,000 for 2009 and $1,181,000 for 2008. Amounts accrued for
professional liability insurance, including estimates for losses below retention levels, were $1,629,000 for 2009 and $1,602,000 for 2008. Changes in trends of loss severity or loss frequency may affect the calculation of these estimates and create
the need for subsequent adjustments to estimated loss reserves. Fair Value Measurement In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurement and disclosures that is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November15, 2007. This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the related disclosure requirements. This statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or
permit fair value measurements. The statement indicates, among other things, that a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the
absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Relative to authoritative guidance for fair value measurement and disclosures, the FASB issued additional guidance to exclude accounting for leases and its
related interpretive
55 Table of Contents AMERICAN DENTAL PARTNERS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued For the Years Ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 
2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions. The Company adopted the additional guidance as of January1, 2008, with the exception of the application of the statement to
non-recurring nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, which the Company adopted as of January1, 2009. This statement had no impact. The Company uses the market approach technique to value its financial instruments. There were no changes in valuation techniques during 2009. The Companys financial assets and liabilities are
primarily composed of cash equivalents and an interest rate swap. The current authoritative guidance for fair value
measurement and disclosures establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for
substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data based on assumptions of the Company used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset or
liabilitys classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December31, 2009 and 2008:  Level1

December31, 2009, the estimated fair value of the Companys revolving line of credit was $25,333,000 and the fair value of the term loan was $81,355,000. Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax
consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory rates applicable to future years to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, as well as from
net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. The Company evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the

adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These
sources of income inherently rely heavily on estimates. The Company uses its historical experience and its short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. To the extent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a
deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. The Company is subject to income tax arising from
U.S. federal and multiple state jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by U.S. federal and state taxing authorities. The tax years 2006 and 2007 have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service and
are closed to examination. Tax years 2008 and 2009 remain open to examination. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options using the treasury stock method.
The computation of diluted earnings per share does not assume conversion, exercise or contingent exercise of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Financial Accounting and Standards
Board, or FASB, issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for business combinations.The amendment is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December15, 2008. The purpose of the amendment is to
better represent the economic value of a business combination transaction. The changes from the previous guidance include, but are not limited to: 1acquisition costs are recognized separately from the acquisition; 2known contractual
contingencies at the time of the acquisition are considered part of the liabilities acquired and measured at their fair value; all other contingencies are part of the liabilities acquired and measured at their fair value only if it is more likely
than not that they meet the definition of a liability; 3contingent consideration based on the outcome of future events is recognized and measured at the time of the acquisition; 4business combinations achieved in stages step
acquisitions recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as noncontrolling interests, in the acquiree, at the full amounts of their fair values; and 5a bargain purchase defined as a business combination in which the total
acquisition-date fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree requires that excess to be recognized as a gain attributable to the
acquirer. The provisions of the amendment are only applicable for our transactions that qualify as business combinations and not our affiliation transactions. No material effect at adoption but may materially affect accounting for future business
combinations. The FASB issued an amendment to accounting and disclosure requirements for consolidated financial statements
with a focus on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financials statements. The amendment is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December15, 2008. The amendment was issued to improve the relevance, comparability and
transparency of financial information provided to investors by requiring all entities to report noncontrolling minority interests in subsidiaries in the same way as equity in the consolidated financial statements. Moreover, the amendment
eliminates the diversity that existed in accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests by requiring they be treated as equity transactions.

2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
Preferred securities, including noncontrolling interests, that are redeemable for cash or other assets to be classified outside of permanent equity if they are redeemable 1at a fixed or
determinable price on a fixed or determinable date, 2at the option of the holder or 3upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer. Accordingly, we have classified noncontrolling interest as
mezzanine equity and not as part of equity. The FASB issued an amendment to accounting and disclosure requirements for
derivative instruments with a focus on disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities. The amendment is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after November15, 2008. This amendment requires enhanced disclosures
about an entitys derivative and hedging activities and encourages, but does not require, comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption. The Company adopted the amendment and applicable disclosures are included. In April 2009, the FASB issued additional guidance on accounting and disclosures for fair value with a focus on identifying and disclosing
assets and liabilities when the volume and level of activity have significantly decreased. The FASB also issued authoritative guidance relating to accounting for impaired debt securities. These standards are effective for interim and annual periods
ending after June15, 2009. We adopted the interim disclosure requirement of fair value and determined that the remaining additional accounting guidance has no current application see Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Fair
Value Measurement for further discussion. In May2009, the FASB issued new accounting and disclosure guidance
with respect to disclosures on subsequent events. The amendment is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after June15, 2009. This statement incorporates guidance into accounting literature that was previously addressed only in
auditing standards. Subsequent events are referred to as either Type I events that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date or Type II events that provide additional evidence with respect to conditions
that did not exist at the balance sheet date but arose subsequent to that date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. Recognized subsequent events Type I should be recognized in the financial statements.
Nonrecognized subsequent events Type II should not be recognized in the financial statements but the nature of the event and an estimate of its financial effect disclosed. In June2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for transfers of financial assets. The new guidance eliminates the concept of a
qualifying special-purpose entity, changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets and requires additional disclosures in order to enhance information reported to users of financial statements by providing greater
transparency about transfers of financial assets, including securitization transactions, and an entitys continuing involvement in and exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets. The amendment is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November15, 2009. The amendment will not have a material impact on our consolidated results. In June
2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities. The amendment is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after November15, 2009. The amendments
include ithe elimination of the exemption for qualifying special purpose entities, iia new approach for determining who should consolidate a variable-interest entity and iiichanges to when it is necessary to reassess who
should consolidate a variable-interest entity. The amendment is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after November15, 2009 and for interim periods within that first annual reporting period. The amendment is not expected
to have a material impact on our consolidated results.

2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
In June 2009, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The
codification is the single source for all authoritative GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied for financial statements issued for periods ending after September15, 2009. The codification does not change GAAP and did not have an affect on
our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Other new pronouncements issued by the FASB that are not
effective until after December31, 2009 are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, financial position, results of operations or liquidity or that are not relevant to us are not included above.

December1, 2009, the Company completed an acquisition of the nonclinical assets of Christie Dental Practice Group, P.L., Christie Dental to establish a Florida presence. In connection with the acquisition, the Company entered
into a 40-year service agreement with a professional limited liability company. The acquisition was funded with borrowings and cash on hand. The acquired business contributed revenues of $997,000 and earnings from operations of $256,000 to the
Company for the period from December1, 2009 to December31, 2009. The Company incurred $561,000 of acquisition
costs related to the Christie Dental acquisition attributed to legal and consulting services. These expenses are included in general corporate expense in the Companys consolidated statement of income for the year ended December31, 2009.

The following table summarizes the consideration paid to acquire Christie Dental and the
amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date:  Amount Current assets 220,000 Property and equipment 3,866,000 Service agreement 11,000,000 Trade name 2,000,000 Non-compete agreements 220,000 Goodwill 10,730,000 Other non current assets 171,000 Total assets acquired 28,207,000 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 1,116,000 Other long term liabilities 91,000 Total liabilities assumed 1,207,000 Total allocation of purchase price consideration 27,000,000 In connection with the Christie Dental acquisition, the Company recorded $11,000,000 of tax deductible
intangible assets related to the service agreement with the affiliated practice; $2,000,000 of intangible assets classified as an indefinite lived trade name intangible; and $220,000 of employment non-compete agreements. The intangible assets
related to the service agreement is amortized over 25 years and the intangible assets related to the employment non-compete agreements are amortized over 5 years. In addition, the Company recorded tax deductible goodwill of $10,730,000. The Company
believes the resulting amount of goodwill reflects its expectations of synergistic benefits expected to result from the application of the Companys more experienced and deeper resources of its national organization to the dental facilities,
administrative and management staff and professionals of Christie Dental resulting in enhanced growth and operating margins. In accordance with the asset purchase agreement between the Company and Christie Dental, the transaction consideration is subject to a post-closing adjustment. The adjustment, if any, is defined as the difference between a target net
working capital amount and the net working capital calculated as of December1, 2009. If the parties are not in agreement the matter will be submitted to an independent accountant for resolution. Subsequent to December31, 2009, the
parties have agreed that there will be no working capital adjustment. The following unaudited pro forma summary presents

These amounts have been calculated after applying the Companys accounting policies
and adjusting the results of Christie Dental to reflect the additional interest, depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming interest had been applied on the borrowed portion of the purchase price from January1, 2008
and fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets had been applied from January1, 2008, together with the consequential tax effects. These pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and
are not necessarily indicative either of the results of operations that actually would have resulted had the acquisition been in effect at the beginning of the respective periods or of future results. 5 Property and Equipment Property and equipment consisted of the following at December31 in thousands:  2009 2008 Land and buildings 783 783 Equipment 63,938 58,473 Furniture and fixtures 12,621 11,984 Leasehold improvements 45,576 41,188 Total property and equipment 122,918 112,428 Less accumulated depreciation 69,152 57,886 Total property and equipment, net 53,766 54,542 Depreciation expense was $11,137,000, $11,054,000 and $9,422,000 for the years ended December31, 2009,

Intangible asset amortization expense for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $9,463,000, $9,634,000
and $7,049,000, respectively. Annual amortization expense for each of the next five fiscal years will be approximately $9,570,000. The amortization period for service agreements is 25 years. The trade name for Metro Dentalcare was reclassified from
a definite life to an indefinite life intangible asset in 2009. At that time of the Metro Dentalcare acquisition in 2007, the Company had not determined its future strategy for trade names in the Minneapolis-St. Paul market. As part of the
settlement of litigation with PDG, the Company transferred the Park Dental trade name to PDG and in 2009 concluded that the Metro Dentalcare trade name would be the trade name in the Minneapolis-St. Paul market and therefore should be
categorized as an indefinite lived intangible asset. As of December31, 2009, the total carrying amount of intangible assets not subject to amortization was $5,059,000 and comprised of the Christie Dental, Metro Dentalcare and Arizona Tooth
Doctor trade names. The weighted average amortization period for customer relationships is two years. The weighted average remaining life of covenants not to compete is five years. The weighted average remaining life of all intangible assets
excluding indefinite lived trade names is 17 years. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows in

deduction reduces taxes payable. Tax benefits associated with tax deductions for stock option exercises were credited to
additional paid-in capital in the amounts of $115,000 and $75,000 for the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

years 2007 and prior are closed. The Company adopted the FASB interpretation for accounting for uncertainty on income taxes
on January1, 2008. There was no material impact on its results of operations or financial position as a result of the implementation of this FASB interpretation. The amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2009 was
$689,000, of which $581,000 would affect the Companys effective tax rate if recognized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in thousands:  2009 2008 2007 Balance, beginning of year 386 393 253 Additions for tax positions during the current year 331 63 Additions for business combinations 190 Reductions for tax positions of prior yearsfor Settlements during the period 116 15 Lapses of applicable statute of limitations 58 7 98 Balance, end of year 543 386 393 It is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months; however,
the Company does not expect the change to have a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position. The
Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued in connection with unrecognized tax benefits as a component provision for income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties were $146,000 as of December31, 2008 and December31, 2009.

credit and an $80,000,000 term loan. The senior secured credit facility matures in August 2012 and can be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, acquisitions and affiliations, and capital expenditures. Borrowings under the
senior secured credit facility bear interest at the Companys option at either prime or the greater of LIBOR or 2% plus a margin. The margin is based upon the Companys debt coverage ratio and ranges from 475% to 550% for prime
borrowings and 525% and 60% for LIBOR borrowings. In addition, the Company pays a commitment fee on the unused balance of the revolving line of credit that ranges from 0375% to 0625%. Borrowings are limited to an availability formula based on
earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA adjusted for certain items, and are collateralized by a first lien on substantially all of the Companys assets, including a pledge of the stock of the Companys
subsidiaries. The senior secured credit facility requires scheduled quarterly principal repayments on the term loan.
Principal repayments of $2,000,000 are required for each of the quarters ended March31, 2010 through September30, 2010, $2,500,000 for each of the quarters ended December31, 2010 through September30, 2011, $3,000,000 for each
of the quarters ended December31, 2012 through June30, 2012, and $53,000,000 due at maturity. The total amount of repayments on the term loan in 2009 was $2,000,000.

8 Debt Continued 
The Company must comply with financial and other covenants, including minimum net worth,
minimum EBITDA, minimum leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios as defined by the senior secured credit agreement. Pursuant to provisions of the senior secured credit facility, the Company is permitted to borrow up to $25,000,000 annually for
acquisitions including earn-outs and contingent payments on previously completed acquisitions.In November 2009, the Company entered into an amendment of the credit facility in order to fund the acquisition of Christie Dental pursuant to which
the Company was permitted to make acquisitions up to $32,000,000 annually through December31, 2009 and up to $25,000,000 thereafter. The Company was in compliance with its amended covenants as of December31, 2009. The outstanding balance with respect to the senior secured credit facility as of December31, 2009 was $78,000,000 under the term loan
and $23,850,000 under the revolving line of credit.The Company had stand-by letters of credit amounting to $1,669,200 at December31, 2009, and, based on borrowing covenants, reduced by the stand-by letters of credit, approximately
$26,140,000 was available for borrowing under the revolving line of credit. In connection with an equity offering see Note
11, Stockholders Equity and borrowings under the senior secured credit facility, the Company retired its previous $75,000,000 revolving line of credit and $100,000,000 term loan in August 2009. The Company entered into an interest rate swap on May9, 2007 on $20,000,000 of its borrowings. Under this arrangement, the Company has
effectively converted three-month, floating LIBOR interest rate exposure, plus a credit spread, to a fixed 50%, plus a credit spread, until February 2012. 9 Litigation Expense In December 2007, the Company entered into a
litigation settlement agreement with PDG. Under the terms of the definitive agreements contemplated by the settlement agreement and in release of the litigation with PDG, the Company transferred to PDG the leases and operating assets of 25 of the 31
Park Dental facilities and the trade name Park Dental to PDG, effective February29, 2008. The parties also entered into a transition services agreement. Under the agreement, the Company agreed to provide interim management services
to PDG for a period of up to nine months commencing on January1, 2008 for $19,000,000. PDG paid the interim management services fee and the Company provided the services. The parties completed the final steps in their termination of the
relationship. In accordance with authoritative guidance for accounting for contingencies, the Company accrued a loss
contingency of $30,968,000 at December31, 2007, which comprised: i$39,968,000, representing the estimated fair value, using discounted cash flows, of the operating assets being transferred, and iia reduction of $9,000,000 from
the $19,000,000 to be paid by PDG, which represents the amount deemed in excess of the fair market value of the management services that were to be provided. In addition to this $30,968,000 accrual, litigation expense in the Companys statement
of operations also comprised: i$2,035,000 of accounts receivable due from PDG that the Company reserved as part of the litigation settlement, and iiprofessional fees associated with the litigation of $3,731,000. The Company expensed,

9 Litigation Expense Continued 
On February29, 2008, under the terms of the settlement agreement, the Company
transferred the operating assets of 25 of the 31 Park Dental facilities, and, pursuant to authoritative guidance for impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, the Company realized a net gain of $30,763,000, which represents the fair value of the
assets transferred in excess of their book value. In addition, the Company recorded an interim management services fee, in 2008 totaling $10,000,000, offset by the costs to provide these services including severance costs. 10 Pending Shareholder Litigation Settlement Pursuant to the terms of the pending shareholder settlement agreement, the insurance company that issued the Companys Directors, Officers and Corporate Liability Insurance Policy has paid $6,000,000
into a settlement fund that will be distributed in accordance with the Courts order if the Court grants its final approval. The Court preliminarily approved the settlement agreement on December23, 2009 and has scheduled a fairness
hearing for March18, 2010. As a result of the pending settlement, the Company has recorded $6,000,000 in accrued expenses to reflect the pending settlement and $6,000,000 in prepaid expenses and other current assets to reflect the pending
receipt of insurance proceeds as of December31, 2009. 11 Stockholders Equity Preferred Stock The
Company is authorized to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $001 par value per share. Preferred stock may be
issued in one or more series as determined by the Board of Directors without further stockholder approval, and the Board of Directors is authorized to fix and determine the terms, limitations and relative rights and preferences of such preferred
stock, and to fix and determine the variations among series of preferred stock. Any new preferred stock issued would have priority over the common stock with respect to dividends and other distributions, including the distribution of assets upon
liquidation and dissolution. Such preferred stock may be subject to repurchase or redemption by the Company. The Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, could issue preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that could adversely
affect the voting power of the holders of common stock and the issuance of which could be used by the Board of Directors in defense of a hostile takeover of the Company. As of December31, 2009 and 2008, there were no shares of preferred stock
issued or outstanding. Common Stock The Company is authorized to issue up to 25,000,000 shares of common stock, $001 par value per share. In August 2009, the Company issued 2,599,000 shares of common stock in an underwritten public
offering, which included 339,000 shares issued pursuant to the exercise of an over-allotment option granted to the underwriters in connection with the offering, at a price of $1200 per share, less an underwriting discount of $066 per share and
offering expenses, for net proceeds of $29,209,000. The proceeds were used to reduce indebtedness. As of December31, 2009, 16,272,786 shares were issued and 15,690,286 shares were outstanding. As of December31, 2008, 13,484,241 shares of
common stock were issued and 12,901,741 shares were outstanding. Treasury Stock On December16, 1999, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $5,000,000 of its common stock in the open
market. Under this plan, the Company has repurchased 582,500 shares of its common stock through December31, 2009 at a cost of $3,874,000.

12 Stock-based Compensation Options granted under the following plans generally have a ten-year term and generally have a vesting period of four years, except for options granted under the 2005 Directors Stock
Option Plan, which have three year vesting terms. At December31, 2009, options for 1,415,465 shares were vested and 729,950 shares were available for future grants under the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2005 Directors Stock Option Plan.
The Company issues new shares upon stock option exercises. No restricted shares have been awarded. Under authoritative
guidance for stock-based compensation, the Company is required to select a valuation technique or option-pricing model that meets the criteria as stated by the standard, which includes a binomial model and the Black-Scholes model. At the present
time, the Company is using the Black-Scholes model. Applying the modified prospective method, as elected by the Company, the Company must estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense related to stock-based compensation as opposed to
only recognizing those forfeitures and the corresponding reduction in expense as they occur. The Company has chosen to use the short-cut method to determine the pool of windfall tax benefits. In addition, the revised authoritative
guidance requires the Company to reflect tax savings resulting from the tax deductions in excess of expense as a financing cash flow in its statement of cash flows rather than as an operating cash flow as reflected prior to the adoption of the
revised guidance. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense for options granted under its 2005 Equity Incentive
Plan, 2005 Directors Stock Option Plan and its 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP of $1,603,000 and $1,978,000 for the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. This expense was recorded within general corporate
expense on the Companys consolidated statements of income. In addition, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation for options grants of $1,466,000 and $1,396,000 for the years ended December31,
2009 and 2008, respectively, and no amounts were capitalized. The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for unvested stock option awards as of December31, 2009 was approximately $2,023,000, and the weighted average period of
time over which this cost will be recognized is 16 years. The fair value for these options and employee stock purchase
rights granted was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for the years ended December31:  2009 2008 2007 StockOptions ESPP StockOptions ESPP StockOptions ESPP Risk-free interest rate 21 30 27 16 46 51 Expected dividend yield 00 00 00 00 00 00 Expected volatility 58 50 77 71 42 39 Expected life years 600 050 540 050 620 050 Expected forfeiture 40 00 40 30 Weighted average fair value of options/ purchase rights granted during the year 381 133 631 195 1060 613
The Company
calculated the volatility assumption using a blend of a historical volatility rate for a period equal to the expected term and an expected volatility rate based on more recent activity. The Company estimated the expected life of its stock options
using the weighted average of the actual term of all stock option exercises. Expected life of the Companys ESPP purchase rights reflects the length of each plan period six months at the end of which shares are purchased. Forfeitures are
estimated based on historical experience.

16 Interest Rate Swap The Company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement on May9, 2007 to fix the interest rate on $20,000,000 of borrowings under its senior secured credit facility as a
cash flow hedging instrument that matures in February 2012. The terms of this agreement provide that the Company exchange its variable rate three-month LIBOR payment, plus a credit spread, for a fixed rate of 5%, plus a credit spread. Swaps are
generally held to maturity and are intended to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent with variable rate debt. Accordingly, interest expense associated with the hedge reflects the fixed rate and the change in the fair value of the hedge as of
December31, 2009 included in other non-current liabilities, with an offset to other comprehensive income OCI. The impact of the interest swap hedge on the Companys consolidated financial statements for the periods ending

reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, there has been no such change during the fourth fiscal quarter covered by this annual report.
