The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Keystone
Automotive Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 30, 2001 and March
31, 2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March
30, 2001. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the index at 14a. These financial statements and the financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Keystone
Automotive Industries, Inc. at March 30, 2001 and March 31, 2000 and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended March 30, 2001, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
March 30, 2001
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
Significant subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements
include North Star Plating Co. North Star, Inteuro Parts Distributors,
Inc. Inteuro and Republic Automotive Parts, Inc. Republic the
Company. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
Business Information
The principal business of the Company is the distribution of replacement
parts for automobiles and light trucks to collision repair shops through a
network of service centers located within the United States, one in Mexico,
and one in Canada.
Fiscal Year
The Company uses a 52/53 week fiscal year. The Company fiscal year ends on
the last Friday of March. The fiscal years ended March 30, 2001 and March 29,
1999 included 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended March 31, 2000 included 53
weeks.
Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Concentrations of Risk
Accounts receivable subject the Company to a potential concentration of
credit risk. Substantially all of the Company customers are in the auto body
repair business, none representing more than 1% of sales. The Company performs
periodic credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and
generally does not require collateral. Receivables are generally due within 30
days. Credit losses have consistently been within management expectations.
During 2001 and 2000, the Company imported 15% and 20% of its products from
the Far East, respectively.
Fair Values of Financial Instruments
Fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
payable, bankers' acceptances and other short-term obligations approximate
cost due to the short period of time to maturity. Fair values of long-term
debt, which have been determined based on borrowing rates currently available
to the Company for loans with similar terms or maturity, approximate the
carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original
maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash
and cash equivalents are held by major financial institutions.
27           KEYSTONE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Inventories
The Company inventories consist primarily of automotive after market
collision replacement parts, paint and related items and bumpers. Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market.
Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews the reasonability of its long-lived assets, including
goodwill, as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-
Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, whenever significant events or changes occur
which might impair the recovery of the recorded costs. The Company records
impairment losses on long-lived assets held and used in operations when
indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated
to be generated by those assets are less than their related carrying amounts.
If impairment exists, the amount of such impairment is calculated based upon
discounted cash flows or the market values compared to the recorded costs. In
addition, the Company accounts for its long-lived assets to be disposed of at
the lower of their carrying amounts or fair value less selling and disposal
costs.
During fiscal 2000, the Company recorded an impairment reserve related to
goodwill and covenants not to compete aggregating $33 million relating to
certain acquisitions and an impairment reserve of approximately $630,000
relating to tooling acquired in an acquisition.
Depreciation and Amortization
The Company uses the straight-line method for calculating depreciation and
amortization of property, plant, and equipment over the following estimated
useful lives               
Buildings. 20 years
Machinery and
equipment. 5-12 years
Furniture and fixtures. 5-7 years
Auto and truck. 3-5 years
Leasehold improvements. Term of lease or life of the asset, whichever is shorter Goodwill and Other Intangibles
Goodwill, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair values
of the net assets of acquired entities, is amortized over 15 to 30 years using
the straight-line method. Other intangibles are comprised of covenants not to
compete. Covenants not to compete are amortized using the straight-line method
over the terms of the agreements, generally 3-5 years.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of delivery or
shipment. The costs related to shipping and handling fees are included in
selling and distribution expenses. The Company provides its customers the
right to return products that are damaged or defective. The effect of these
programs is estimated and current period sales and costs of sales are reduced
accordingly.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company elected to continue to account for stock-based compensation
plans using the intrinsic value-based method of accounting prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25, Accounting
28           KEYSTONE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. Under the
provisions of APB No. 25, compensation expense is measured at the grant date
for the difference between the fair value of the stock and the exercise price.
The Company has not granted stock options at less than the fair value of the
stock at the date of grant.
New Accounting Standards
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and
hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives in
the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair
value. In 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities--Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB
Statement No. 133--an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, which defers the
effective date of SFAS No. 133 for one year. The Company must implement SFAS
No. 133 by the first quarter of fiscal year 2002 and has not yet made a final
determination of its impact on the financial statements.
Effective April 1, 2000, the Company adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB
No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, which requires that
entities recognize revenue subject to certain criteria. The adoption of SAB
101 did not have a significant impact on the Company results of operations.
2. ACQUISITIONS
In June 1998, the Company completed its acquisitions of Republic Automotive
Parts, Inc. Republic. The Company issued approximately 2,907,000 shares of
its common stock in exchange for the outstanding common stock of Republic
total purchase price of approximately $631 million using an average share
price of $2169. The fair value of the assets acquired approximated $419
million, net of approximately $288 million of liabilities assumed. The excess
of the purchase price over assets acquired goodwill approximated $212
million and is being amortized over 30 years. The acquisition of Republic is
being accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. At the time of
the acquisition, Republic was engaged in the distribution of automotive
mechanical hard parts and aftermarket collision replacement parts.
The net assets acquired as part of the Republic transaction, which related
to the Republic mechanical hard parts operations, were recorded as assets held
for sale in the allocation of the opening balance sheet at June 27, 1998. The
assets held for sale were recorded at fair value based upon the final sales
price. The results of operations from June 27, 1998 through the date of sale
of the mechanical hard parts operations were accounted for as an adjustment to
the carrying amount of the assets. The assets held for sale were sold in a
series of transactions during fiscal 1999, which resulted in a gain. The gain
on sales has been accounted for as an adjustment of the original purchase
price. The operating results of the Company from June 27, 1998, excluded any
effects from the mechanical hard parts business.
The unaudited pro forma results of operations for the year ended March 26,
1999, as though Republic had been combined with the Company at the beginning
of fiscal 1998, is as follows in thousands, except share and per share
amounts                                   March 26,
1999
Net  $  347,346
Net  $  17,325
Net income per diluted  $    98
Weighted average shares outstanding diluted. 17,649,000                    29           KEYSTONE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  In addition to the Republic acquisition, Keystone acquired six other
companies for approximately $178 million cash, $18 million in stock and a
note payable of $150,000. These acquisitions were accounted for as purchases,
and accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired entities have been
recorded at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The
excess of purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired
was approximately $99 million and has been recorded as goodwill and is being
amortized over 15 to 20 years. The unaudited proforma results for fiscal 1999,
assuming these other acquisitions had been made at the beginning of fiscal
1998, would not be materially different from the pro forma results presented
above.
3. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES
Amortization expense for goodwill and other intangibles for the years ended
March 30, 2001, March 31, 2000 and March 26, 1999 was $2,296,000, $2,649,000
and $2,050,000, respectively, and is included with depreciation and
amortization expense.
4. FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS
The Company maintains a revolving line of credit with a commercial lender
that provides a $30,000,000 unsecured credit facility that expires, as
amended, in November 2001. Initial advances under the revolving line of credit
are made with interest at the lender prime rate; however, at the Company
option, all advances may be converted to LIBOR plus 100%. The agreement also
contains an unused line charge of 025%. At March 30, 2001, $14,880,000 was
outstanding under the line of credit. The loan agreement is subject to certain
restrictive covenants and requires that the Company maintain certain financial
ratios. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of March 30, 2001.
5. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
In June 1998, as part of the Company acquisition of Republic, the Company
issued approximately 2,907,000 shares using an average share price of $2169.
The Company maintains a stock repurchase plan as authorized by the Board of
Directors to purchase shares of its common stock at such times and at such
prices as the President and Chief Financial Officer deemed appropriate.
Repurchased shares are redeemed and treated as authorized but unissued shares.
Since the inception of the plan, the Company has repurchased 35 million

The Company calculates earnings per share as required by SFAS No. 128,
Earnings Per Share. Under SFAS No. 128 basic earnings per share excludes any
dilutive effects of options, warrants and convertible securities. The

antidilutive.
7. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company has entered into various property lease agreements with related
parties, including certain of the Company directors and officers and
agreements with a corporation which is owned by a family member of a Company
officer and director. The leases contain terms up to 10 years. The Company
believes that the terms and conditions of such leases with affiliated parties
are no less favorable than could have been obtained from unaffiliated parties
in arm length transactions at the time such leases were entered into. Rent
expense for related party lease agreements, included in the total rent
expense, amounted to $917,915, $1,373,000 and $1,863,000 for the fiscal years
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, exclusive of the Company obligation for
property taxes and insurance.
8. INCOME TAXES
The liability method is used in accounting for income taxes. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and
liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be
in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.

9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
In March 1979, the Company adopted a defined benefit pension plan the
Plan to provide pension benefits to all non-union employees. Plan benefits
are based on an employee years of service and the compensation during the
five years of employment which would yield the highest average compensation.
Effective in April 1997, the Company suspended the accrual of future benefits.
In June 1998, the Company acquired Republic, including its pension and
postretirement life and health insurance plans Health and Life Plans.
Republic defined benefit plan covers substantially all employees. Benefits
under this plan generally are based upon the employee years of service and
compensation preceding retirement. The Company general funding policy is to
contribute amounts deductible for federal income taxes. Under the Health and
Life Plans, the Company contributes toward the cost of health insurance
benefits for certain retired employees. In order to be eligible for
postretirement health insurance coverage, an employee must retire after
attainment of age 55 and completion of 10 years of service, or attainment of
age 50 and completion of 15 years of service. After attainment of age 65, the
employee will not be eligible for coverage under the health insurance plan.
Effective July 1, 2000, the Company terminated its practice of reimbursing
certain retirees for the cost of supplemental Medicare medical insurance
coverage. These retirees had been receiving a maximum benefit of $75 per
month. Termination of this benefit resulted in a settlement gain of $823,000.
In order to be eligible for life insurance benefits, an employee must retire
after attaining age 55 and completing 10 years of service, or attaining age 50
and completing 15 years of service. Eligible retirees will receive a life
insurance benefit of $2,500 for which the Company pays the full cost. The
Health and Life Plans are unfunded and therefore, premiums are paid from the
Company current operations.
Effective June 30, 1999, the accrual of future benefits under the Republic
defined benefit plan was suspended. The defined benefit plans of the Company
and Republic were merged on December 31, 1999.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for
Pensions, at March 30, 2001 the Company recorded a minimum pension liability
representing the excess of the accumulated benefit obligation over the fair
value of the plan assets. The balance of the liability of $882,000 was
reported in accumulated comprehensive loss, net of applicable deferred income
taxes of $341,000. No minimum pension liability existed at March 31, 2000.
In determining the actuarial present value of projected benefit obligations
at March 30, 2001 and March 31, 2000, a discount rate of 725% and 8 respectively, was used. There are no future compensation increases due to the
suspension of benefit accruals. The expected long-term annual rate of return
on assets was 8% for the years ended March 30, 2001 and March 31, 2000.
For the Health and Life Plans, the actuarial present value of benefit
obligations at March 30, 2001 and March 31, 2000, assumed a discount rate of
725% and 8%, respectively. The assumed healthcare cost trend rate for 2001
and later was 7%. The assumed health care cost trend rate has a significant
effect on the amounts reported. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed
health care cost trend rate would have the following effects                           1-Percentage 1-Percentage
