32             Independent Auditors' Report The Board of Directors and Shareholders,
SonoSite, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of SonoSite, Inc. as of December
31, 2000 and 1999, and the related statements of operations, cash flows and
shareholders' equity and comprehensive loss for each of the years in the three-
year period ended December 31, 2000. In connection with our audits of the
financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule
listed in the accompanying Index for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999.
These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of SonoSite, Inc. management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and the financial statement schedule
based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of SonoSite, Inc. as of December
31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered
in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly,
in all material respects, the information set forth therein. KPMG LLP

Notes to the Financial Statements
1.  Business Overview SonoSite commenced operations as a division of ATL Ultrasound, Inc. ATL. We
were formed to develop the design and specifications for a highly portable
ultrasound device and other highly portable ultrasound products for diagnostic
imaging in a multitude of clinical and field settings. On April 6, 1998, we
became an independent, publicly owned company through a tax-free distribution of
one new share in us, for every three shares of ATL stock held as of that date.
ATL retained no ownership in SonoSite following the spin-off.
We finalized the development and began commercialization of our first products
in 1999, recognizing our initial product sales revenue in September 1999.
Continuing to develop and enhance our products in 2000, we introduced the
SonoHeart system for cardiology and the high frequency SonoSite 180 system along
with three new transducers. As of December 31, 2000, our products were
comprised of two highly portable ultrasound systems, the SonoSite 180 and
SonoHeart systems, and five transducers. Initially, we sold our products
primarily through medical product distributors worldwide. In February 2000,
recognizing the need for and potential of a direct selling operation, we
established a direct sales force focused exclusively on selling our products
within the United States. In 2000, we began to see success in terms of revenue
generated by this direct selling force. Additionally, we continued to identify
international markets for our products and distribution partners within these
markets.
2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of presentation
The financial statement information for periods prior to April 6, 1998, the
Distribution Date, represents the combination of our company and the handheld
ultrasound division of ATL. Such information has been derived from the
historical books and records of ATL and reflects our revenues and expenses, as
we operated as a division of ATL prior to April 6, 1998. Financial statement
information for the period subsequent to the Distribution Date consists solely
of our activity as a separate company.
For periods prior to the Distribution Date, the statement of operations included
allocations for facilities and certain support services, such as engineering
overhead, administration, accounting, finance, human resources and regulatory
functions. These allocations were based on estimates of personnel time and
effort spent by ATL on our behalf. We believe these allocations were made on a
reasonable basis. Subsequent to the Distribution Date, certain items noted
above were incorporated into agreements with ATL and charges were based upon
actual time spent by ATL on our behalf.
The portion of our financing requirements funded by ATL prior to the
Distribution Date are shown as net advances from ATL in shareholders' equity.
Activity in the net advances from ATL equity account represents net cash
received from ATL through intercompany advances to fund our operating deficits.
The financial information included herein is not necessarily indicative of our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the future or what
the financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been if
we had been a separate, independent company during all periods presented.
Use of estimates
38 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
Reclassification of prior period balances
Certain amounts reported in previous periods have been reclassified to conform
to current period presentation.
Financial instruments
Cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of money market and highly liquid debt
instruments with original or remaining maturities at purchase of three months or
less.
Investment securities
Investment securities consist of high-grade corporate debt. While our intent is
to hold our securities until maturity, we classified all securities as
available-for-sale, as the sale of such securities may be required prior to
maturity to implement management strategies. These securities are carried at
fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of
other comprehensive loss until realized. Realized gains and losses from the
sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific
identification basis.
A decline in market value of any available-for-sale security below cost that is
determined to be other than temporary results in a revaluation of its carrying
amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost
basis for the security is established. Premiums and discounts are amortized or
accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using
the effective interest method. Interest income is recognized when earned.
Accounts receivable
In the ordinary course of business, we grant credit to a broad customer base.
Of the accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2000, 51% and 49% were
receivable from international and domestic parties, prior to any provision for
doubtful accounts, of which approximately $345,000 was classified as a long-term
other asset. The same percentages as of December 31, 1999 were 59% and 41%.
The following table presents individual customers whose outstanding receivable
balance as a percentage of total trade receivables and/or revenue as a
percentage of total sales revenue exceeded 10% as of December 31                  Accounts Receivable            Sales Revenue
2000       1999          2000       1999
Brazilian distributor       11%
Japanese distributor                            26%
United States distributor              28%          14%        22%
United States distributor                                  15%
Italian distributor                 13%                   10%
Totals               11%       41%          40%        47%
39 Fair value of financial instruments
The carrying value of our financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, certain long-term other assets and debt
approximates fair value. Cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable
approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. Long-term other assets
and debt approximate fair value as interest rates on these notes approximate
market.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates actual
cost on a first-in, first-out method, or market.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at historical cost, less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as
incurred, with additions and improvements to property and equipment capitalized.
Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line basis over
estimated useful lives as follows        Asset              Estimated Useful Lives   Equipment, other than computer      5-7 years
Software                 3 years
Computer equipment            3-5 years
Furniture and fixtures          5 years
Leasehold improvements          Lesser of estimated useful life
or expected remaining lease term
The carrying value of long-lived assets is evaluated for impairment when events
or changes in circumstances occur, which may indicate the carrying amount of the
asset may not be recoverable. We evaluate the carrying value of the assets by
comparing the estimated future cash flows generated from the use of the asset
and its eventual disposition with the assets' reported net book value.
Investment in affiliates
Where we have investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant
influence over operating and financial policies, these investments are accounted
for under the equity method. Accordingly, our share in the net income or loss
in these investments is included in other operating income or loss.
Concentration of credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit
risk consist principally of cash equivalents, investments and accounts
receivable.
Revenue recognition
Sales revenue
We generally recognize sales revenue when a product is shipped under an
agreement with a customer, risk of loss has passed to the customer and
collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured. We provide
warranty protection for one year from the date of shipment and accordingly
accrue charges for related product warranty expenses based upon estimated costs
to repair or replace products sold.
Deferred revenue represents revenue that is initially not recognized because it
does not meet the criteria for recognition, including service contracts,
nonstandard shipping terms and certain shipments to affiliates.
40 Grant revenue
For periods prior to September 1999, revenue consisted of grant revenue under a
United States Government Defense Advanced Research Projects Administrative
DARPA grant. Grant revenue was recognized consistent with the terms of the
DARPA grant and was generally tied to the achievement of technological
milestones, the majority of which were achieved by the second quarter of 1998.
Research and development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Advertising costs
We expense production costs for advertising and promotional activities as
incurred. Advertising and promotional expenses for the years ended December 31,
2000, 1999 and 1998 were $42 million, $38 million and $185,000.
Income taxes
Deferred income taxes are provided based on the estimated future tax effects of
temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards arising subsequent to the Distribution Date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that
are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A
valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets
to the amount, if any, expected to be realized. Under certain provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the availability of our net operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to limitation if it should be
determined that there has been a change in ownership of more than 50% of our
stock. Such determination could limit the utilization of net operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards.
Stock-based compensation
We apply the principles of APB Opinion No. 25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees and related interpretations when measuring compensation
costs for our employee stock option plans. Pro forma net loss and net loss per
share are presented as if compensation costs had been determined in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123 SFAS 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation.
Net loss per share
Basic and diluted net loss per share was computed by dividing the net loss by
the weighted average shares outstanding exclusive of unvested restricted shares.
For periods subsequent to the Distribution Date, weighted average shares
outstanding represent our actual weighted average common shares. For the
periods prior to the Distribution Date, weighted average shares outstanding
represent ATL weighted average shares as adjusted for the exchange ratio
established on the Distribution Date of one of our shares for every three shares
of ATL.
41 Outstanding options to purchase our shares, our unvested restricted shares
issued by ATL and options issued by us were not included in the computations of
diluted net loss per share because to do so would be antidilutive. As of
December 31, 2000, our outstanding options and unvested restricted shares issued
by ATL through the Distribution Date totaled 146,320 and 2,185 and outstanding
options we issued totaled 2,153,926. As of December 31, 1999, our outstanding
options and unvested restricted shares issued by ATL through the Distribution
Date totaled 206,983 and 14,013 and outstanding options we issued totaled
1,905,652. As of December 31, 1998, our outstanding options and unvested
restricted shares issued by ATL through the Distribution Date totaled 270,453
and 60,930 and outstanding options we issued totaled 1,277,365.
The following is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic
loss per share calculations in thousands, except loss per share                   2000            1999              1998

New accounting pronouncements
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which will be effective for the year 2001.
SFAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every
derivative instrument, including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts, be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or
liability measured at its fair value. The statement also requires that changes
in the derivative fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge
accounting criteria are met. We assessed the impact of SFAS 133 and do not
expect our adoption of the standard will have a material effect on our financial
results.
In July 2000, we implemented Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation
No. 44 FIN 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation. FIN 44 clarified the application of Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25 APB 25. Specifically, FIN 44 clarified the definition of
employee for purposes of applying APB 25, the accounting consequence of
various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award,
and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business
combination. The implementation had no impact on our financial statements.
In the fourth quarter of 2000, we implemented Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101
SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, which was issued by
the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC in 1999. SAB 101 provides guidance
on revenue recognition and the SEC staff views on the application of
accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues. The application
of SAB 101 did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
42 Also in the fourth quarter of 2000, we implemented Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue No. 00-10 EITF 00-10, Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and
Costs. EITF 00-10 requires recording amounts billed to a customer for shipping
and handling costs as revenue. We reclassified 1999 amounts to conform to this
new presentation. Prior to implementation, we netted amounts billed to
customers for shipping and handling against the cost of sales revenue. The
implementation did not impact our gross margin and did not have a material
impact on our financial statements.
Liquidity As of December 31, 2000, we held cash and cash equivalents of $111 million. In
addition, we held $182 million of short-term investment securities. We expect
our cash needs to continue in future periods as we continue to fund our
manufacturing and research and development activities, increase our direct
selling efforts and targeted marketing plans, enhance our educational offerings
and provide adequate administrative support for these areas. We believe that
our existing cash will be sufficient to fund our operations through 2001;
however, we cannot provide assurance that unforeseen circumstances will not
impact this belief.
3. Arrangements with ATL
We entered into several agreements with ATL effective as of the Distribution
Date. These agreements were negotiated between our chief executive officer and
the chief executive officer of ATL. Both parties consider the terms of these
agreements competitive with the cost of obtaining such rights and services in
arm length negotiations with third parties. The following is a summary of the
significant agreements OEM Supply Agreement
During 1999 and the first half of 2000, ATL produced many of our products,
including our systems and most of our transducers. During the third and fourth
quarter of 2000, we transitioned all manufacturing operations from ATL to our
own facility. This included transferring equipment, personnel and inventory.
As a result, ATL no longer manufactures products for us. We do not expect any
further payments to be made to ATL as a result of this contract.
Technology Transfer and License Agreement
We agreed to a Technology Transfer and License Agreement. We own certain highly
portable ultrasound technology developed while we were a division of ATL and
have access to certain ATL technology that is useful in the development and
manufacture of highly portable ultrasound products. Under this agreement, we
took ownership of the technology developed as part of the DARPA grant and also
patent rights which had been established or were being pursued for that
technology.
This license bears a royalty equivalent to a percentage of the net sales of
hand-carried ultrasound products under fifteen pounds that use ATL technology.
The license will become paid-in-full after a period of eight years or by a lump-
sum payment which is due ATL if we cease to be an independent, stand-alone
company during the eight-year period following the Distribution Date. The lump-
sum payment is $150 million during the five years following the Distribution
Date and $75 million for the next three years. For the years ended December 31,
2000 and 1999, we incurred a royalty expense to ATL of $908,000 and $297,000,
which we classified as a cost of sales revenue.
We also entered into a cross-license agreement whereby we have the right to use
technology developed by ATL during the three-year period following the
Distribution Date in our hand-carried products and ATL has the right to use our
developments made during the same period in its full-size ultrasound systems.
We also agreed that we will not engage in the full-size ultrasound business and
ATL will not engage in the hand-carried ultrasound device business for five
years following the Distribution Date.
43 After this five-year period, each party ongoing obligation with respect to the
technology of the other will be to respect the patent and copyright rights of
the other, although we will retain a license to use the previously licensed ATL
technology in hand-carried systems and ATL will retain a license to use our
previously licensed technology in full-size ultrasound systems.

affiliates includes the initial capital contribution and 40% of the net income
or loss of SonoSite China for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999.

During 2000, we invested $500,000 for a 199% common stock investment in a
company from which we were also contracting for direct sales services. The
$475,000 excess of our acquisition cost over our share of the underlying net
assets of this investee was being amortized as a component of our equity in
losses of this affiliate under the equity method of accounting. Initially, we
were using a three-year period to amortize this excess cost. In the fourth
quarter of 2000, we decided to terminate our business relationship with this
affiliate when we decided to discontinue the direct sales contract and hire the
contractors as employees in early 2001. We then accelerated our amortization of
excess cost to fully amortize the remaining balance in the fourth quarter of
2000 when we made this decision. We were a major customer of the affiliate and
we paid them $34 million in 2000 for contract direct sales services.
7.  Shareholders' equity
Stock option plans
As of December 31, 2000, we had the following stock compensation plans: the 1998
Nonofficer Employee Stock Option Plan 1998 NOE Plan, the 1998 Option, Stock
Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock, Stock Grant and Performance Unit Plan
1998 Plan, the Nonemployee Director Stock Option Plan Director Plan, the
Management Incentive Compensation Plan MIC Plan, and the Adjustment Plan.
Additionally, in 2000, we granted 95,000 options outside of these plans to
corporate officers, which are included within the information presented herein
and contain similar provisions to our 1998 Plan. We account for stock options
under provisions of APB 25 and therefore, to the extent the fair value of the
underlying stock is equal to or less than the exercise price on the measurement
date, no compensation expense is recognized for employee stock option grants.
Prior to the Distribution Date, all option information represents the
outstanding and issued options of ATL. Financial data presented relating to
option grants represents the exchange ratio calculated as one of our options for
every six ATL options outstanding.
If we accounted for the costs relating to all option grants under the provisions
of SFAS 123, our net loss and net loss per share would have been the following
pro forma amounts   in thousands, except per share data       2000      1999      1998
Net loss:
As reported                     $18,972    $21,612    $13,025
Pro forma                      $24,601    $26,962    $14,946
Basic and diluted net loss per share:
As reported                     $ 201    $ 308    $ 272
Pro forma                      $ 261    $ 384    $ 312 Pro forma compensation expense is recognized for the fair value of each option
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes multiple option pricing
model. The following assumptions were used for option grants in 2000, 1999 and
1998: expected volatility 63%, 61% and 67%; risk-free interest rates 49%, 64%
and 48%; expected terms of 650, 500 and 916 years; and zero dividend yield.
46 Under the 1998 NOE Plan, 1998 Plan, MIC Plan and option grants outside our stock
option plans, as of December 31, 2000, 2,380,388 total shares of common stock
are authorized primarily for issuance upon exercise of stock options at prices
equal to the fair market value of our common shares at the date of grant. As of
December 31, 2000, 341,462 shares were available for grant under our stock
option plans. In most cases, stock options are exercisable at 25% each year
over a four-year vesting period and have a ten-year term from the grant date.
However, provisions for 377,000 options granted in 1999 allowed for potential
early vesting to occur upon the achievement of certain financial targets in 1999
and 2000. In 1999, these financial targets were met and, as a result, 188,500
options vested effective February 2000. These targets were not met in 2000 and
therefore the unvested portion, 188,500 options, vest four years from their date
of grant.
Under the Director Plan, as of December 31, 2000, 115,000 shares of common stock
were authorized for issuance of stock options at prices equal to the fair market
value of our common shares at the date of grant. At December 31, 2000, there
were no shares available for grant under this Plan. Stock options are
exercisable and vest in full one year following their grant date provided the
optionee has continued to serve as our director. Each option expires on the
earlier of ten years from the grant date or 90 days following the termination of
a director service as our director.
We also have an Adjustment Plan, which includes options granted in connection
with the dividend distribution occurring on April 6, 1998. As part of this
distribution, existing ATL option holders received one of our options for every
six ATL options held. There was no change to the intrinsic value of the option
grant, ratio of exercise price to market value, vesting provisions or option
period as a result of the distribution. As of December 31, 2000, 164,505 shares
of common stock are authorized primarily for issuance upon exercise of stock
options at prices equal to the fair market value of our common shares at the
date of grant.
Also as part of the distribution, restricted shares totaling 2,185 and 14,013,
as determined using the exchange ratio of one of our restricted shares for every
three ATL restricted shares, were outstanding as of December 31, 2000 and 1999.
Summary of stock option activity
Prior to the Distribution Date, we had no stock option plans specifically
identified as our plans. All stock options granted through that date were part
of ATL option plans.

Stock purchase rights
On April 6, 1998, we and First Chicago Trust Company of New York entered into a
Rights Agreement. The Rights Agreement has certain anti-takeover provisions,
which will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to
acquire us; however, it will not interfere with any merger or other business
combination approved by our board of directors.
Under the terms of the Rights Agreement, holders of our common stock also hold
rights exercisable in certain circumstances discussed below. Holders of these
rights may purchase 1/100th of a share of our Series A Participating Cumulative
Preferred Stock, par value of $100, at a price equal to four times the average
high and low sales prices of our common stock quoted on the Nasdaq National
Market for each of the 10 trading days commencing on the sixth trading day
following April 6, 1998. Circumstances under which these rights are exercisable
involve acquisition or knowledge of expected acquisition or tender of 15% or
more of our outstanding common stock. In addition, the board of directors may
redeem all, but not part, of the rights outstanding for consideration in cash or
common stock at a price equal to $001 per right.
Separate certificates for rights will not be distributed. Our common stock
certificates serve as evidence of the rights. Prior to exercise of the rights
and in accordance with the terms of the Rights Agreement, the rights have no
voting or dividend value. If the rights are not exercised prior to April 5,
2008, they expire, with no consideration for the expiration being provided to
the holder of the right.
Warrants
In 1999, we issued 15,000 warrants to nonemployee consultants in connection with
marketing work performed. These warrants had exercise prices of $1144 and
vested one year from their date of grant. During 2000, all these warrants were
exercised through a cashless exercise, which resulted in the issuance of 8,877
shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2000, no warrants were outstanding.
8.  Income taxes
For income tax purposes, our results through the Distribution Date were included
in the consolidated federal income tax return of ATL and, accordingly, the net
operating loss generated prior to the Distribution Date will not be available to
us for use in periods subsequent to the Distribution Date. During the period
from the Distribution Date through December 31, 2000, we accumulated a net
operating loss carryforward of approximately $528 million. This carryforward
begins expiring in 2018
48 and will be fully expired in 2020. Approximately $42 million of the net
operating loss carryforward results from stock option deductions which, when and
if realized, would result in a credit to shareholders' equity.
Because we incurred losses since inception, a valuation allowance entirely
offsetting deferred tax assets has been established, thereby eliminating any
deferred tax benefit in 2000 and 1999. The increase in the valuation allowance
of $77 million in 2000, $81 million in 1999 and $36 million in 1998 is
primarily the result of increasing net operating loss carryforwards.
The tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards that give rise to
significant portions of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at
December 31 are as follows in thousands                                     2000     1999
Deferred tax assets:

401k Retirement Savings Plan
All our employees are eligible to participate in our 401k Plan. Terms of the
401k Plan permit an employee to contribute up to a maximum of 16% of an
employee annual compensation on a post-tax or pretax basis, up to the maximum
permissible by the Internal Revenue Service IRS during any plan year.
Contributions exceeding the IRS limitation may be made only on a post-tax basis.
We match each employee contribution in increments equivalent to 100% for the
first 3% and 50% for the second 3% of the employee contribution percentage. In
2000, 1999 and 1998, we contributed $369,000, $207,000 and $98,000, in matching
contributions to the 401k Plan in accordance with the plan terms. Employees
immediately vest in the contributions the employee makes. Vesting in our
contribution on behalf of the employee occurs at equal increments at the end of
each year of the first five years of an employee service with us.

Operating leases
We currently lease office and manufacturing space under an operating lease. As
of December 31, 2000, future minimum lease payments are as follows       in thousands
2001              $ 954
2002                971
2003               1,008
2004               1,053
2005               1,084
Thereafter            1,671
$6,741
Prior to November 1998, we utilized facility space within ATL and were charged
rent expense for the space occupied. Subsequently, we vacated the ATL facility
and moved into a separate facility. Rent expense for the years ended December
31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $730,000, $329,000 and $243,000, which includes ATL
charges of $128,000 for office space in 1998. We did not incur any rent expense
prior to the Distribution Date as our operations were in ATL owned facility.
Capital lease obligations
We entered into certain long-term obligations to finance the purchase of capital
equipment as part of our normal business operations. Original terms of the
obligations range from 18 to 48 months and have interest rates ranging between
10% and 15%. Obligations are secured by underlying assets. The following is a
summary of the capital lease obligations and the related future minimum payments
as of December 31, 2000      in thousands
2001                            $  290
2002                              159

Other commitments
As part of our agreements with our suppliers, suppliers may procure resources
and material expected to be used for the manufacture of our product in
accordance with our production schedule provided to them. In the event these
items are not used in the quantities submitted as part of the production
schedule or material becomes obsolete as a result of production timing, material
changes or design changes, we may be responsible for compensating our suppliers
for these procurements.
As part of obtaining our lease for our new facility, we were required to deposit
approximately $334,000, representing restricted cash with our bank, which is
included in long-term other assets. We have no other significant bank
arrangements.
Contingencies
We obtained approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA
to sell and distribute our product domestically. However, we cannot assure you
that the FDA will approve future product submissions by us. Additionally,
international sales and distribution are dependent upon our obtaining approval
of certain foreign regulatory agencies. We obtained approval from many of these
agencies; however, we cannot assure you that we will obtain approval from other
foreign regulatory agencies from which we seek approval in the future, on a
timely basis, if at all.
