49 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of DoubleClick Inc. We have completed an integrated audit of DoubleClick Inc.s
2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004
and audits of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our
opinions, based on our audits, are presented below. Consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of DoubleClick Inc. and its subsidiaries
at December31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2004 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein when
read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item9A, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2004 based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004,
based on criteria established in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on managements
assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial 50 Table of Contents statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As described in Managements Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Performics
Inc. from its assessment of internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2004 because it was acquired
by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2004.
We have also excluded Performics Inc. from our audit of internal
control over financial reporting. Performics Inc. is a
wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues
represent 13% and 5%, respectively, of the related consolidated
financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended
December31, 2004.

NOTE1
Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies   
Description of business DoubleClick is a leading provider of technology and data
products and services used by advertising agencies, marketers
and Web publishers and advertisers to plan, execute and analyze
their marketing programs. Combining technology and data
expertise, DoubleClicks solutions help its customers to
optimize their advertising and marketing campaigns online and
through direct mail. DoubleClick offers a broad array of
technology and data products and services to its customers to
allow them to address a full range of the marketing processes,
from pre-campaign planning and testing, to execution,
measurement and campaign refinements. DoubleClick derives its revenues from two business segments:
TechSolutions and Data. DoubleClick TechSolutions includes its
Ad Management, Marketing Automation and Performics divisions.
DoubleClicks Ad Management division primarily consists of
the DART for Publishers Service, the DART for Advertisers
Service and the DART Enterprise ad serving software product.
DoubleClicks Marketing Automation division primarily
consists of email products based on DoubleClicks DARTmail
Service and its Enterprise Marketing Solutions, or EMS, business
which consists of its campaign management and marketing resource
management, or MRM, products. Following the acquisition of
Performics Inc. in June 2004, DoubleClick created a third
division within TechSolutions which offers search engine
marketing and affiliate marketing solutions. DoubleClick Data includes its Abacus and Data Management
divisions. Abacus utilizes the information contributed to the
proprietary Abacus database by Abacus Alliance members to make
direct marketing more effective for Abacus Alliance members and
other clients. Data Management offers direct marketers solutions
for building and managing customer marketing databases, tools to
plan, execute and measure multi-channel marketing campaigns, as
well as list processing and data hygiene products and services. On October31, 2004, DoubleClick announced that it retained
Lazard Freres Co. to explore strategic options for the
business to achieve greater shareholder value. These options may
include a sale of part or all of its businesses,
recapitalization, extraordinary dividend, share repurchase or a
spin-off.   
Basis of presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of DoubleClick, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and
subsidiaries over which it exercises a controlling financial
interest. All significant intercompany transactions and balances
have been eliminated. Investments in entities in which
DoubleClick does not have a controlling financial interest, but
over which it has significant influence are accounted for using
the equity method. Investments in which DoubleClick does not
have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted
for using the cost method.   
Cash and cash equivalents, investments in marketable
securities and restricted cash Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and highly liquid
investments with a remaining contractual maturity at the date of
purchase of three months or less. Marketable securities consist of investment grade government and
corporate debt securities and are classified as current or
non-current assets depending on their dates of maturity. As of
December31, 2004, all marketable securities included in
non-current assets have maturities greater than one year. DoubleClick classifies its investments in marketable securities
as available-for-sale. Accordingly, these investments are
carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported
as a separate component of stockholders equity.
DoubleClick recognizes gains and losses when these securities
are sold using the specific 56 Table of Contents DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2004 identification method. DoubleClick has not recognized any
material gains or losses from the sale of its investments in
marketable securities. Restricted cash primarily represents amounts placed in escrow
relating to funds used to cover office lease security deposits
and DoubleClicks automated clearinghouse payment function. At December31, 2004, cash and cash equivalents,

Property and equipment Property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using
the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life
of the asset or the lease term. As required by SOP98-1,
Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use, DoubleClick capitalizes certain
computer software developed or obtained for internal use.
Capitalized software is depreciated using the straight-line
method over the estimated life of the software, generally three
to five years. 57 Table of Contents DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2004   
Goodwill and other intangible assets DoubleClick records as goodwill the excess of purchase price
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, prescribes a two-step process for impairment
testing of goodwill, which is performed annually, as well as
when an event triggering impairment may have occurred. The first
step tests for impairment, while the second step, if necessary,
measures the impairment. DoubleClick has elected to perform its
annual analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year as
of October1st. See Note6
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Intangible assets include patents, trademarks, customer
relationships, purchased technology and a covenant not to
compete. Such intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line
basis over their estimated useful lives, which are generally two
to five years.   
Impairment of long-lived assets DoubleClick assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets,
including intangible assets, held and used whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that future cash flows,
undiscounted and without interest charges, expected to be
generated by an assets disposition or use may not be
sufficient to support its carrying amount. If such undiscounted
cash flows are not sufficient to support the recorded value of
assets, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying
value of long-lived assets to their estimated fair value.   
Revenue recognition DoubleClicks revenues are presented net of a provision for
advertiser credits, which is estimated and established in the
period in which services are provided. These credits are
generally issued in the event that solutions do not meet
contractual specifications. Actual results could differ from
these estimates. TechSolutions. Revenues include fees earned from the use
of DoubleClicks Ad Management, Marketing Automation and
Performics products and services. Revenues derived from
DoubleClicks hosted, or Web-based, applications, including
the DART for Publishers Service, the DART for Advertisers
Service and DARTmail, are recognized in the period the
advertising impressions or emails are delivered, provided
collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.
DART Service activation fees are deferred and recognized ratably
over the expected term of the customer relationship. Performics search and affiliate marketing revenues are
recognized when a contract has been signed, services have been
rendered, the related fee is fixed and determinable, and
collection of the fee is reasonably assured. Performics revenues
are recorded on a net basis, exclusive of pass
through charges when acting as an agent on behalf of its
clients with respect to such costs. For DoubleClicks licensed ad serving, campaign management
and marketing resource management software solutions, revenues
are recognized when product installation is complete, which
generally occurs when customers begin utilizing the product,
there is pervasive evidence of an arrangement, collection is
reasonably assured, the fee is fixed or determinable and
vendor-specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total
fees to all elements of the arrangement. A portion of the
initial ad serving software license fee is attributed to the
customers right to receive, at no additional charge,
software upgrades released during the subsequent twelve months.
Revenues attributable to software upgrades are deferred and
recognized ratably over the period covered by the software
license agreement, which is generally one year. Revenues from consulting services are recognized as the services
are performed and customer-support revenues are deferred and
recognized ratably over the period covered by the customer
support agreement, which is generally one year. 58 Table of Contents DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2004 Data. Abacus provides services to its clients that result
in a deliverable product in the form of consumer and business
prospect lists. Revenues are recognized when the product is
shipped to the client, provided collection of the resulting
receivable is reasonably assured. Data Management provides list
processing, database development and database management
services. List processing revenues are recognized in the period
that the product is completed and delivered, provided that
collection is reasonably assured. Database development fees are
deferred and recognized ratably over the expected term of the
customer relationship. Database management revenues are
recognized as the services are provided.   
Product development Product development expenses consist primarily of compensation
and related benefits, consulting fees and other operating
expenses associated with product development departments. The
product development departments perform research and
development, enhance and maintain existing products and provide
quality assurance. Software development costs are required to be
capitalized when a products technological feasibility has
been established by completion of a working model of the product
and ending when a product is available for general release to
customers. To date, completion of a working model of
DoubleClicks products and general release have
substantially coincided. As a result, DoubleClick has not
capitalized any software development costs.   
Issuance of stock by affiliates Changes in DoubleClicks interest in its affiliates arising
as the result of their issuance of common stock are recorded as
gains and losses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations,
except for any transactions that must be recorded directly to
equity in accordance with the provisions of
SABNo51, Accounting for Sales of Stock of a
Subsidiary.   
Advertising expenses DoubleClick expenses the cost of advertising and promoting its
services as incurred. Such costs are included in sales and
marketing in the consolidated statements of operations and
totaled $62million, $28million and
$39million for the years ended December31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.   
Income taxes DoubleClick uses the asset and liability method of accounting
for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to the differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases and to tax loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in results of
operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A
valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax
assets reported if, based on the weight of the available
evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.   
Foreign currency The functional currencies of DoubleClicks foreign
subsidiaries are their respective local currencies. The
financial statements maintained in local currencies are
translated to United States dollars using period-end rates of
exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates during the
period for revenues, cost of revenues and expenses. Translation
gains and losses are accumulated as a separate component of
stockholders equity. Net gains and losses from foreign
currency transactions are included in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations and were not significant during the
periods presented. 59 Table of Contents DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Equity-based compensation DoubleClick accounts for its employee stock option plans under
the intrinsic value method, in accordance with the provisions of
Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees and related interpretations. Under APB
No25, generally no compensation expense is recorded when
the terms of the award are fixed and the exercise price of the
employee stock option equals or exceeds the fair value of the
underlying stock on the date of the grant. DoubleClick has
adopted the disclosure-only requirements of
SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS123, which allows
entities to continue to apply the provisions of APB No25
for transactions with employees and provide pro forma net income
and pro forma earnings per share disclosures for employee stock
grants made as if the fair value based method of accounting in
SFAS123 had been applied to these transactions. Had DoubleClick determined compensation expense of employee
stock options based on the estimated fair value of the stock
options at the grant date, consistent with the guidelines of
SFAS123, DoubleClicks net income would have
decreased and net loss would have increased to the pro forma
amounts indicated below

approximately 134million, 120million and

excludes the effect of 38million shares issuable upon

Concentrations of credit risk Financial instruments that potentially subject DoubleClick to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents, investments in marketable securities and accounts
receivable. Credit is extended to customers based on an evaluation of their
financial condition and collateral is not required. DoubleClick
performs ongoing credit assessments of its customers and
maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts. DoubleClicks financial instruments consist of cash and
cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities,
restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued
expenses and convertible subordinated notes. At
December31, 2004 and 2003 the fair value of these
instruments approximated their financial statement-carrying
amount with the exception of the convertible subordinated notes.
The Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2023 had an
estimated fair value of $1263million and
$1387million at December31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.   
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 61 Table of Contents DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2004   
Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years
financial statements to conform to current year presentation.   
New accounting pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued SFASNo123 revised 2004,
Share-Based Payment SFAS123R,
which replaces SFASNo123
SFAS123 and supercedes APB Opinion
No25. SFAS123R requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
recognized in the financial statements based on their fair
values. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under
SFAS123 will no longer be an alternative to financial
statement recognition. SFAS123R is effective for periods
beginning after June15, 2005. Early application of
SFAS123R is encouraged, but not required. SFAS123R
permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a
modified prospective method, or a modified
retrospective method. Under the modified
prospective method, compensation cost is recognized in the
financial statements beginning with the effective date, based on
the requirements of SFAS123R for all share-based payments
granted after that date, and based on the requirements of
SFAS123 for all unvested awards granted prior to the
effective date of SFAS123R. Under the modified
retrospective method, the requirements are the same as
under the modified prospective method, but also
permits entities to restate financial statements of previous
periods based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with
SFAS123. DoubleClick will adopt SFAS123R as of
July1, 2005; however, DoubleClick has not yet determined
which of the adoption methods it will use. Based on stock
options granted to employees through December31, 2004,
DoubleClick expects that the adoption of SFAS123R on
July1, 2005 will reduce both third quarter 2005 and fourth
quarter 2005net income by approximately $40million
or $003per diluted share. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFASNo153,
Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB
Opinion No29. SFASNo153 requires that
exchanges of productive assets be accounted for at fair value
unless fair value cannot be reasonably determined or the
transaction lacks commercial substance. SFASNo153
is effective for nonmonetary assets exchanges occurring in the
fiscal year beginning January1, 2006 and is not expected
to have a material effect on DoubleClicks Consolidated
Financial Statements. In November 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue
No03-13 EITF03-13, Applying the
Conditions in Paragraph42 of SFAS144 in Determining
Whether to Report Discontinued Operations. EITF03-13
provides guidance for evaluating whether the criteria in
paragraph42 of SFASNo144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, have
been met for classifying as a discontinued operation, a
component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is
classified as held for sale. To qualify as a discontinued
operation, paragraph42 of SFASNo144 requires
that cash flows of the disposed component be eliminated from the
operations of the ongoing entity and that the ongoing entity not
have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of
the disposed component after the disposal transaction.
EITF03-13 defines which cash flows are relevant for
assessing whether cash flows have been eliminated and it
provides a framework for evaluating what types of ongoing
involvement constitute significant continuing involvement. The
guidance contained in EITF03-13 is effective for
components of an enterprise that are either disposed of or
classified as held for sale in fiscal periods beginning after
December15, 2004. EITF03-13 may have a material
impact on DoubleClicks financial position or results of
operations in 2005 depending on the outcome of our review of
strategic options. In October 2004, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the
EITF with respect to EITF Issue No04-10
EITF04-10, Determining Whether to Aggregate
Operating Segments That Do Not Meet the Quantitative
Thresholds. EITF04-10 clarifies the guidance in
paragraph19 of SFASNo131, Disclosures 62 Table of Contents DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2004 about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.
According to EITF04-10, operating segments that do not
meet the quantitative thresholds can be aggregated under
paragraph19 only if aggregation is consistent with the
objective and basic principle of SFASNo131, the
segments have similar economic characteristics, and the segments
share a majority of the aggregation criteria listed in items
a-e in paragraph17 of SFASNo131. The FASB
staff is currently working on a FASB Staff Position
FSP to provide guidance in determining whether two
or more operating segments have similar economic
characteristics. The effective date of EITF04-10 has been
delayed in order to coincide with the effective date of the
anticipated FSP. DoubleClick does not foresee any significant
changes in the reporting practices used to report its segment
information. On September30, 2004, the EITF confirmed their tentative
conclusion on EITF Issue No04-8
EITF04-8, The Effect of Contingently
Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share.
EITF04-8 requires contingently convertible debt
instruments to be included in diluted earnings per share, if
dilutive, regardless of whether a market price contingency for
the conversion of the debt into common shares or any other
contingent factor has been met. Prior to this consensus, such
instruments were excluded from the calculation until one or more
of the contingencies were met. EITF04-8 is effective for
reporting periods ending after December15, 2004, and
requires restatement of prior period earnings per share amounts.
DoubleClick adopted EITF04-8 during the fourth quarter of
2004 and have restated prior period earnings per share amounts
and presented 2004 earnings per share amounts based upon the
requirements of EITF04-8. In 2004 and 2003, diluted
earnings per share amounts reflect DoubleClicks Zero
Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2023, which represent
103million potential shares of common stock. In addition,
2003 dilutive earnings per share amounts include
DoubleClicks 475% Convertible Subordinated Notes due
2006, which represent 38million potential shares of
common stock. These notes were redeemed in July 2003. In 2002,
diluted earnings per share amounts exclude DoubleClicks
475% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 since their
inclusion would have had an antidilutive effect. Due to the
adoption of this pronouncement, full year 2004 and 2003 diluted
earnings per share were reduced by $002 and $001, respectively   
Change in Accounting Estimate Effective June15, 2003, DoubleClick changed its estimate
of the useful lives of its furniture and fixtures and leasehold
improvements located at its former New York headquarters. The
average remaining useful life for these assets was reduced from
approximately two and twelve years for furniture and fixtures
and leasehold improvements, respectively, to six and one half
months for both asset types in order to recognize depreciation
expense over the remaining time that the assets were expected to
remain in service. The change was due to the relocation of
DoubleClicks New York headquarters in the fourth quarter
of 2003. On August19, 2003, DoubleClick entered into a
Lease Termination Agreement to terminate the lease for its
facility located in SanFrancisco. As a result of this
lease termination, DoubleClick accelerated the amortization of
its leasehold improvements at this facility due to the change in
useful life of these assets. The average remaining useful life
of these assets was reduced from approximately nine years to one
month as DoubleClick vacated this facility on September19,
2003. As a result of these changes for the New York and
SanFrancisco facilities, net income was reduced by
approximately $146million, or $010per diluted
share, for the year ended December31, 2003. The
amortization of these assets is allocated over headcount and
therefore impacts cost of revenue, sales and marketing, general
and administrative and product development expenses. Effective January1, 2002, DoubleClick changed its estimate
of the useful lives of its production equipment and software.
The estimated useful life for these assets was extended from
three years to four years in order to recognize depreciation
expense over the remaining time that the assets are expected to
be in service. The change was based on an analysis performed by
DoubleClicks operations department. As a result of this
change, net loss was reduced by approximately $83million,
or $006per diluted share, for the year ended
December31, 2002. 63 Table of Contents DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

of MessageMedia, Inc. MessageMedia, a provider of
permission-based email marketing and messaging solutions. The
acquisition of MessageMedia allowed DoubleClick to expand its
suite of email product and service offerings as well as broaden
its client base. DoubleClick acquired all the outstanding shares, options and
warrants of MessageMedia in exchange for approximately one
million shares of DoubleClick common stock valued at
approximately $75million and stock options and warrants
to acquire DoubleClick common stock valued at approximately
$02million. In connection with the acquisition,
DoubleClick loaned $20million to MessageMedia to satisfy
MessageMedias operating requirements. The loan was
extinguished upon the closing of the acquisition and included as
a component of the purchase price. The purchase price, inclusive
of approximately $16million of direct acquisition costs,
was approximately $113million. The value of the
approximately one million shares of DoubleClick common stock
issued was determined based on the average market price of
DoubleClick common stock, as quoted on the NASDAQ National
Market, for the day immediately prior to, the day of, and the
day immediately after the number of shares due to MessageMedia
shareholders became irrevocably fixed pursuant to the agreement
under which MessageMedia was acquired. The MessageMedia options

Approximately $19million of the purchase price has been
allocated to customer relationships and is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over two years. DoubleClick recorded
approximately $285million in goodwill, which represents
the remainder of the excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of net assets acquired. This goodwill is not tax
deductible and, in accordance with SFASNo142, will
be and has been periodically tested for impairment. See
Note6 Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. Assumed liabilities include costs accrued of approximately
$125million for idle space at a facility in Louisville,
Colorado. As of December31, 2004, approximately
$59million has been paid. In the second quarter of 2003,
DoubleClick recorded additional reserves against this facility
of $17million. In the third quarter of 2004, DoubleClick
subleased this property at rates in excess of its previous
estimate of sublease income and reversed $45million of
this reserve as a restructuring credit. The results of operations for MessageMedia have been included in
DoubleClicks Consolidated Statements of Operations from
the date of acquisition. Divestitures   
DoubleClick Japan On December26, 2002, DoubleClick sold 45,049shares
of common stock in DoubleClick Japan and received proceeds of
$143million, reducing its ownership interest from 382%
to 156%. DoubleClick also retained one seat on DoubleClick
Japans board of directors. As a result of this
transaction, DoubleClick accounts for its remaining
31,271shares in DoubleClick Japan under the equity method
of accounting. See Note3 Investments in
Affiliates. Revenue recognized through services provided to DoubleClick
Japan was approximately $34 and $32million during the
years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.   
North American Media Business On July10, 2002, DoubleClick sold its North American Media
business to L90, Inc., which was renamed MaxWorldwide, Inc.
MaxWorldwide, in exchange for 48million
shares in MaxWorldwide and $50million in cash. The
48million shares represented 161% of outstanding
MaxWorldwide common stock and were valued at approximately
$31million. Pursuant to the merger agreement, DoubleClick
has the right to receive an additional $60million if,
prior to July10, 2005, MaxWorldwide achieves
EBITDA-positive results for two out of three consecutive
quarters. EBITDA, as defined in the merger agreement, is
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
excluding certain non-recurring items. During the three months
ended September30, 2002, December31, 2002,
March31, 2003, and June30, 2003, and the one month
ended July31, 2003, MaxWorldwide did not achieve
EBITDA-positive results. DoubleClick accounts 68 Table of Contents DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2004 for this investment under the equity method of accounting and
reports its share of MaxWorldwides results on a 90-day lag. On August13, 2002, MaxWorldwide repurchased
5,596,972shares of its common stock. As a result of this
repurchase, DoubleClicks ownership percentage increased to
198%. On July22, 2003, MaxWorldwide stockholders approved a
proposal to adopt a plan of liquidation and dissolution,
pursuant to which it would dissolve and liquidate MaxWorldwide
and its subsidiaries. On July31, 2003, MaxWorldwide
completed the sale of its MaxOnline division and the plan of
liquidation and dissolution became effective. As of
August1, 2003, MaxWorldwide has adopted the liquidation
basis of accounting and therefore will not be reporting a
statement of operations for periods subsequent to July31,
2003. As a result of these events it is unlikely that
MaxWorldwide will achieve the financial milestones that would
trigger DoubleClicks right to receive the
$60million in contingent cash consideration discussed
above. In its quarterly report on Form10-Q for the quarter
ended September30, 2003, MaxWorldwide reported net assets
in liquidation of approximately $257million. See
Note3 Investments in Affiliates. DoubleClick recognized revenue of approximately
$22million and $21million during the years ended
December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, relating to
services provided to MaxWorldwide.   
@plan On May6, 2002, DoubleClick sold its @plan research product
line to NetRatings, Inc. NetRatings, a provider of
technology-driven Internet audience information solutions for
media and commerce, in exchange for $120million in cash
and 505,739shares of NetRatings common stock valued at
approximately $61million. DoubleClick sold the NetRatings
shares in the fourth quarter of 2002 and the first quarter of
2003.   
European Media Business On January28, 2002, DoubleClick completed the sale of its
European Media business to AdLINK Internet Media AG
AdLINK, a German provider of Internet advertising
solutions, in exchange for $263million and the assumption
by AdLINK of liabilities associated with DoubleClicks
European Media business. Intercompany liabilities in an amount
equal to $43million were settled through a cash payment
by AdLINK to DoubleClick at the closing of the transaction.
Following the closing of the transaction described above, United
Internet AG United Internet, AdLINKs largest
shareholder, exercised its right to sell to DoubleClick 15% of
the outstanding common shares of AdLINK in exchange for
$306million. Pursuant to its agreement with United
Internet, the exercise of this right caused DoubleClicks
option to acquire an additional 21% of AdLINK common shares for
United Internet to vest. This option was only exercisable if
AdLINK achieved EBITDA-positive results for two out of three
consecutive fiscal quarters before December31, 2003.
AdLINK did not achieve EBITDA positive results during these
periods, therefore the option expired unexercised. As a result of the transactions described above, DoubleClick
sold its European Media business and received a 15% interest in
AdLINK, which represented approximately 39million shares
valued at approximately $83million. DoubleClicks
option to acquire an additional 21% of the outstanding common
shares of AdLINK for United Internet also vested. DoubleClick
received $20million as partial reimbursement for its cash
outlays related to the acquisitions of, and payments with
respect to, the minority interests in certain of its European
subsidiaries pursuant to its agreement to sell its European
Media business. See Note3 Investments in
Affiliates. 69 Table of Contents DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

2004 In January 2004, DoubleClick commenced operations of Abacus
Deutschland, a joint venture with AZ Direct GmbH, a subsidiary
of Bertelsmann AG, a global media company. DoubleClick has a 50%
interest in the joint venture which has required investments to
date of approximately $12million. In the first quarter of 2004, DoubleClick recognized a gain of
$24million relating to a distribution from MaxWorldwide
in connection with its plan of liquidation and dissolution.
DoubleClick still maintains a 198 70 Table of Contents DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2004 interest in MaxWorldwide and may receive additional
distributions in future periods as a result of the finalization
of its plan of liquidation and dissolution. On September22, 2004, DoubleClick sold its 15% interest in
AdLINK Internet Media AG for $95million to United
Internet AG. As a result of the sale, DoubleClick recorded a
gain of approximately $71million and no longer holds an
equity interest in AdLINK. For the year ended December31, 2004, DoubleClick recorded
an equity loss of $13million. This loss consisted of
approximately $09million from DoubleClicks equity
investment in Abacus Deutschland and approximately
$04million from DoubleClicks equity investment in
DoubleClick Japan. 2003 During the first quarter of 2003, DoubleClick sold its remaining
investment in NetRatings and received proceeds of approximately
$06million. The gain recognized on the sale of this
investment was not material. For the year ended December31, 2003, DoubleClick recorded
an equity loss of $25million. This loss consisted of
approximately $20million from DoubleClicks equity
investment in MaxWorldwide and approximately $05million
from DoubleClicks equity investment in DoubleClick Japan. 2002 In the third quarter of 2002, DoubleClick determined that the
carrying value of certain of its investments, principally its
cost-method investments in AdLINK and NetRatings and its
equity-method investment in MaxWorldwide were impaired based on
the continued decline in the fair market value of these
investments. As a result, DoubleClick recorded an impairment
charge of $117million, which represented the difference
between DoubleClicks carrying value and the estimated fair
value of these investments. The estimated fair values of
DoubleClicks investments in AdLINK, NetRatings and
MaxWorldwide, were determined based on the closing market price
of their stock on September30, 2002. Additionally, it was
determined that DoubleClick Asia, a joint venture and a cost
method investment, would be liquidated and therefore had no
continuing value. As a consequence, DoubleClick wrote-off its
entire investment in DoubleClick Asia and recognized an
impairment charge of $24million. These charges have been
included in Impairment of investments in affiliates
on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the fourth quarter of 2002, DoubleClick sold certain of its
investments in affiliates and recorded a gain of approximately
$79million. The gain was associated with the sale
DoubleClicks investment in ValueClick and partial sales of
its ownership interests in DoubleClick Japan and NetRatings. In
the fourth quarter of 2002, DoubleClick entered into a
repurchase agreement with ValueClick whereby ValueClick
repurchased all of DoubleClicks remaining 79million
shares for $213million or approximately $270per
share. DoubleClick recognized a gain of $47million from
the sale of the investment. In addition, in December 2002
DoubleClick sold 45,049shares of common stock in
DoubleClick Japan and reduced its ownership interest to 156%.
DoubleClick received proceeds of $143million and
recognized a gain of $31million. Additionally, in the
fourth quarter of 2002 DoubleClick sold 402,011shares of
NetRatings and received proceeds of approximately
$25million. DoubleClick recognized an immaterial gain on
the sale of this investment. For the year ended December31, 2002, DoubleClick recorded
an equity loss of $03million. This loss consisted of
approximately $05million from DoubleClick equity
investment in MaxWorldwide, partially offset by equity income of
$02million relating to DoubleClicks 50% interest in
the Abacus Direct Europe joint venture. Since the June26,
2002 acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Abacus Direct
Europe that DoubleClick did not previously own, the results of
operations of Abacus Direct Europe have been consolidated into
DoubleClicks operations. See Note2

STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2004 In 2004, DoubleClick recorded an impairment charge of
$41million relating to intangible assets of its
Enterprise Marketing Solutions, or EMS, business. See
Note6 Impairment of Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets NOTE6 Impairment of Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets In 2004, DoubleClick initiated a valuation for its Enterprise
Marketing Solutions, or EMS, business, which consists of its
campaign management and marketing resource management products.
This valuation was performed with the assistance of a third
party to determine if the recorded balances of goodwill and
other intangible assets relating to this reporting unit were
recoverable. The recoverability of these assets was brought into
question as a result of the lower than expected revenues
generated to date and the reduced estimates of future
performance primarily from DoubleClicks campaign
management products. The fair market value of the EMS reporting
unit was determined based on projected discounted cash flows and
price/revenue multiples of competitors in the EMS marketplace.
The outcome of this valuation resulted in an impairment charge
of $56million being recorded during the quarter based on
the difference between the carrying value and the fair market
value of this business. The impairment charge consisted of a
write-down in goodwill of $15million and intangible
assets of $41million. The conclusion regarding the
recognition of this charge was made in connection with the
preparation of the financial statements for the third quarter of
2004. There were no such charges in 2003 based upon the results of
DoubleClicks annual goodwill impairment test. In 2002, based on the prolonged softness in the economy and the
then current and projected operational performance of
DoubleClicks email reporting unit, DoubleClick initiated a
third-party valuation of its email reporting unit to determine
whether the recorded balance of goodwill related to this
reporting unit was recoverable. The outcome of this valuation
resulted in an impairment charge of approximately
$438million being recorded during the third quarter of
2002. The fair market value of the email reporting unit was
determined based on revenue projections, then recent
transactions involving similar businesses and the price/revenue
multiples at which they were bought and sold and the then
price/revenue multiples of our competitors in the email
marketplace. In addition, DoubleClick determined that the fair
value of certain intangible assets was considered impaired.
DoubleClick recorded an impairment charge of $33million
based on the difference between the carrying value and estimated
fair value of certain intangible assets also associated with the
email reporting unit. NOTE7 Property and Equipment

Convertible Subordinated Debt On June23, 2003, DoubleClick issued $1350million
aggregate principal amount of Zero Coupon Convertible
Subordinated Notes due 2023 the Zero Coupon Notes
in a private offering. The Zero Coupon Notes do not bear
interest and have a zero yield to maturity. The Zero Coupon
Notes are convertible under certain circumstances into
DoubleClick common stock at a conversion price of approximately
$1312per share, which would result in an aggregate of
approximately 103million shares, subject to adjustment
upon the occurrence of specified events. Each $1,000 principal
amount of the Zero Coupon Notes will initially be convertible
into 762311shares of DoubleClick common stock prior to
July15, 2023 if the sale price of DoubleClicks
common stock issuable upon conversion of the Zero Coupon Notes
reaches a specified threshold for a defined period of time, if
specified corporate transactions have occurred or if DoubleClick
calls the Zero Coupon Notes for redemption. The specified
thresholds for conversion prior to the maturity date are
aduring any calendar quarter, the last reported sale
price of DoubleClicks common stock for at least 20 trading
days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last
trading day of the previous calendar quarter is greater than or
equal to 120% of the applicable conversion price on that 30th
trading day and bsubject to certain exceptions, during
the five business day period following any five consecutive
trading day period, the trading price per $1,000 principal
amount of Zero Coupon Notes for each of the five consecutive
trading days is less than 98% of the product of the last
reported sale price of DoubleClicks common stock and the
conversion rate initially 762311 on each such day. As of
December31, 2004, these thresholds had not been met. The Zero Coupon Notes are DoubleClicks general unsecured
obligations and are subordinated in right of payment to all of
its existing and future senior debt. DoubleClick may not redeem
the Zero Coupon Notes prior to July15, 2008. DoubleClick
may be required to repurchase any or all of the Zero Coupon
Notes upon a change of control or a termination of trading.
DoubleClick may redeem for cash some or all of the Zero Coupon
Notes at any time on or after July15, 2008. Holders of the
Zero Coupon Notes also have the right to require DoubleClick to
purchase some or all of their notes for cash on July15,
2008, July15, 2013 and July15, 2018, at a price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes
being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid liquidated damages, if
any. 74 Table of Contents DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2004 DoubleClick received net proceeds of approximately
$1315million and incurred issuance costs of approximately
$35million. The issuance costs are amortized from the
date of issuance through July15, 2008 and are included as
a component of other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Zero Coupon Notes contain an embedded derivative, the fair
value of which as of December31, 2004 has been determined
to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position. For
financial accounting purposes, the ability of the holder to
convert upon the satisfaction of a trading price condition
constitutes an embedded derivative. Any significant changes in
its value will be reflected in our future income statements, in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.

Stock purchase warrants In connection with its acquisition of @plan in February 2001,
DoubleClick assumed 99,495 stock purchase warrants. These
warrants each represent the right to purchase, until
May26, 2006, one share of DoubleClick common stock at an

2004, none of these warrants had been exercised. 75 Table of Contents DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2004 In connection with its acquisition of FloNetwork in April 2001,
DoubleClick assumed 7,452 stock purchase warrants. These
warrants each represent the right to purchase, until
September22, 2007, one share of DoubleClick common stock
at an exercise price of $2713per share. As of
December31, 2004, none of these warrants had been
exercised. At December31, 2004, DoubleClick had 106,947 stock
purchase warrants outstanding with a weighted-average exercise

Stock incentive plan The 1997 Stock Incentive Plan the 1997 Plan or the
Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on
November7, 1997 and was subsequently approved by the
stockholders. Under the 1997 Plan, 39,948,152shares of common stock have
been authorized for the issuance of incentive and nonqualified
stock options as of December31, 2004. In addition,
9,718,559shares of common stock are available for future
grants under the 1997 Plan as of December31, 2004. The
number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the
1997 Plan automatically increases on the first trading day of
each calendar year, by an amount equal to three percent 3% of
the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on the
last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar year, or
such lesser amount as may be determined by DoubleClicks
Board of Directors, provided that no such increase will exceed
2,400,000shares. Generally, options granted under the Plan vest ratably over a
period of three to four years from the date of grant and expire
sevenyears from the date of grant and terminate, to the
extent unvested, on the date of termination, and to the extent
vested, generally at the end of the six-month period following
the termination of employment. To the extent that an option
grant permits the exercise of unvested shares and is subject to
repurchase by DoubleClick upon an employees termination of
service, those unvested shares of common stock that are
subsequently repurchased by DoubleClick, whether at the exercise
price or issue paid per share, will be added to the reserve of
common stock available for issuance under the 1997 Plan, unless
otherwise determined by the Board of Directors. In no event,
however, may any one participant in the 1997 Plan receive option
grants or direct stock issuances for more than
1,500,000shares of common stock in the aggregate per

Restructuring   
2004 Restructuring In the third quarter of 2004, DoubleClick recorded a
restructuring credit of $45million. This credit was due
to the reversal of a portion of DoubleClicks real estate
reserve for its facility in Louisville, Colorado. The reversal
of the reserve was due to the sublease of this property at rates
in excess of DoubleClicks previous estimate of sublease
income. Cash paid during 2004 with respect to previously accrued
restructuring charges was approximately $121million. In
the first quarter of 2004, $76million was paid for the
final lease 77 Table of Contents DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2004 termination payment relating to DoubleClicks former New
York headquarters. The remaining $45million of cash paid
in 2004 related to payments for lease and other exit costs in
Louisville, Colorado and New York. The restructuring accrual as of December31, 2004 of
approximately $174million consists primarily of
DoubleClicks facilities in London, England and Louisville,
Colorado. The restructuring accrual associated with
DoubleClicks facilities represents the excess of future
lease commitments over estimated sublease income in locations
where DoubleClick has excess or idle space. In most cases,
subleases have been signed for the entire term of these leases
and DoubleClicks estimate of sublease income is based on
the agreed upon sublease rates. In facilities for which
DoubleClick does not have a sublease signed for the entire term
of the lease, sublease assumptions are made with the assistance
of a real estate firm and are based on the current real estate
market conditions in the local markets where these facilities
are located. Should market conditions or other circumstances
change, this information may be updated and restructuring
charges or credits may be required. As of December31, 2004, approximately $39million
and $135million remained accrued in Accrued
expenses and other current liabilities and Other
long-term liabilities, respectively on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. These amounts related wholly to future lease
costs.   
2003 Restructuring In the second quarter of 2003, DoubleClick recorded a net
restructuring credit of $69million, which related to real
estate items. This credit resulted from a $143million
reversal of a portion of the reserve relating to
DoubleClicks New York headquarters, partially offset by
$74million in additional charges primarily relating to
DoubleClicks facilities in SanFrancisco and London.
The reversal of the reserve was the result of final lease
terminations with respect to DoubleClicks New York
headquarters for which the reserve was in excess of expected
payments. During the third quarter of 2003, DoubleClick recorded a net
restructuring credit of $22million. This resulted from a
net credit from its New York headquarters of approximately
$15million and the termination of the remainder of
DoubleClicks lease in SanFrancisco, which resulted
in a credit of approximately $07million. The net credit
associated with DoubleClicks New York headquarters
consisted of certain exit costs of $25million partially
offset by the reversal of a deferred rent liability of
approximately $15million, all of which were required to
be recorded in the third quarter in accordance with
SFASNo146. In addition, approximately
$25million of reserves were reversed as the result of
favorable settlements of other real estate related items
relating to DoubleClicks New York headquarters which
occurred during the third quarter. The net credit associated
with DoubleClicks SanFrancisco facility resulted
from the estimated restructuring reserve for this facility being
in excess of the actual payments made in connection with the
lease termination. Total costs to terminate the lease associated with
DoubleClicks previous New York headquarters and
SanFrancisco facility were approximately
$445million and $264million, respectively,
inclusive of broker commissions and related costs. The remaining
restructuring accrual at December31, 2003 consists of
approximately $82million of payments to be made pursuant
to the termination agreement in connection with
DoubleClicks previous New York headquarters and
$248million relating to other facilities, primarily
Louisville, Colorado and London, England. The accrual associated
with these other facilities represents the excess of future
lease commitments over estimated sublease income, if any. These
accruals were based on an analysis performed with the assistance
of a real estate firm and are based on the current real estate
market conditions in the local markets where these facilities
are located. As of December31, 2003, approximately $120million
and $210million remained accrued in Accrued
expenses and other current liabilities and Other
long-term liabilities, respectively. These amounts are
inclusive of $136million of other real estate reserves,
which were reclassed into this accrual during the third 78 Table of Contents DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2004 quarter of 2003. These reserves were primarily recorded in
connection with certain business combinations that were
consummated in prior periods.   
2002 Restructuring During 2002, DoubleClick took additional steps to realign its
sales, development and administrative organization and reduce
corporate overhead to position itself for profitable growth in
the future consistent with its long-term objectives. This
involved the involuntary termination of approximately 250
employees, primarily from its TechSolutions division, as well as
charges for excess real estate space and the closure of several
offices. As a consequence, DoubleClick recorded a charge of
$984million to operations during the year, of which
$940million and $44million have been classified in
operating expenses and cost of revenue, respectively. The charge
primarily related to the accrual of future lease costs net of
estimated sublease income and deferred rent liabilities
previously accrued of approximately $770million, the
write-off of fixed assets situated in closed or abandoned
offices of approximately $157million and payments for
severance of approximately $57million. The accrual for
future lease costs and the write-off of fixed assets were
primarily related to its New York office. These charges were
driven by the abandonment of additional space, reductions in the
estimates of future sublease income, as well as the lengthening
of the time required to find a sublease tenant. In addition,
DoubleClick decided to move its data center operations from New
York to its Thornton, Colorado facility. As a result,
DoubleClick recorded a charge of $44million to cost of
revenue relating to the write-off of related fixed assets. As of
December31, 2002, approximately $361million and
$710million remained accrued in Accrued expenses
and other current liabilities and Other long-term
liabilities, respectively. The following table sets forth a summary of the costs and
related charges for DoubleClicks restructuring charges and

For the year ended December31, 2004, DoubleClick recorded
a valuation allowance against those net deferred tax assets that
DoubleClick believes, after considering all the available
objective evidence, both positive and negative, historical and
prospective, with greater weight given to historical evidence,
are not more likely than not expected to be realized. Deferred taxes have not been provided on the cumulative
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because such
amounts are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. Should a
repatriation of foreign earnings occur, DoubleClick does not
expect that such remittance would have a significant effect on
its consolidated financial statements. DoubleClick is currently undergoing several foreign and state
tax audits. While the outcome of such tax audits is uncertain,
DoubleClick believes that adequate amounts of tax and interest
have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to
result. At December31, 2004, DoubleClick had domestic and foreign
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$5773million. The federal net operating loss carryforward
was $5200million. Approximately $3372million of
these net operating loss carryforwards relate to the exercise of
employee stock options and any tax benefit derived there from,
when realized, will be accounted for as a credit to additional
paid-in-capital rather than a reduction to the income tax
provision. Approximately $594million of net operating
loss carryforwards were acquired in various corporate
acquisitions and any tax benefit derived there from, when
realized, will be accounted for as a credit to goodwill or other
acquired intangible assets rather than a reduction to the income
tax provision. In addition, DoubleClick had $399million
of capital loss carryforwards and $49million of tax
credit carryforwards. The federal net operating loss and
research tax credit carryforwards expire in various years
beginning in 2010, while the capital loss carryforwards expire
in various years beginning in 2006. The utilization of a portion
of the net operating loss, capital loss, and research tax credit
carryforwards may be subject to limitation under
U.S.federal income tax laws. 81 Table of Contents DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2004 Operating lease obligations primarily represent rental payments
for office facilities. At December31, 2004, DoubleClick
has recorded restructuring reserves totaling approximately
$174million relating to excess and abandoned space at
certain facilities. Such amounts are included in the table above. In addition, DoubleClick had outstanding standby letters of
credit of approximately $66million at December31,
2004. These letters of credit collateralize DoubleClicks
obligations to third parties under certain operating leases.   
Legal In April 2002, a consolidated amended class action complaint
alleging violation of the federal securities laws in connection
with DoubleClicks follow-on offerings was filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York naming as defendants DoubleClick, some of its officers and
directors and certain underwriters of DoubleClicks
follow-on offerings. Approximately 300 other issuers and their
underwriters have had similar suits filed against them, all of
which are included in a single coordinated proceeding in the
Southern District of New York. In October 2002, the action was
dismissed against the named officers and directors without
prejudice. However, claims against DoubleClick remain. In July
2002, DoubleClick and the other issuers in the consolidated
cases filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint for failure
to state a claim, which was denied as to DoubleClick in February
2003. In September 2003, DoubleClicks Board of Directors
conditionally approved a proposed partial settlement with the
plaintiffs in this matter. In September 2004, an agreement of
settlement was submitted to the court for preliminary approval.
The court granted the preliminary approval motion on
February15, 2005, subject to certain modifications. If the
parties are able to agree upon the required modifications, and
such modifications are acceptable to the court, notice will be
given to all class members of the settlement, a
fairness hearing will be held and if the court
determines that the settlement is fair to the class members, the
settlement will be approved. There can be no assurance that this
proposed settlement will be approved and implemented in its
current form, or at all. If this settlement is not finalized,
DoubleClick intends to dispute these allegations and defend this
lawsuit vigorously. DoubleClick is defending a class action lawsuit filed in
September 2003 in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County,
Pennsylvania, and had been defending another class action
lawsuit filed in January 2004 in the Superior Court for the
State of California in SanJoaquin County, California. Both
these cases allege among other things, deceptive business
practices, fraud, misrepresentation, invasion of privacy and
right of association relating to allegedly deceptive content of
online advertisement that plaintiffs assert we delivered to
consumers and seek among other things, injunctive relief,
compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys fees and
costs. In April 2004, the court in the California action entered
an order dismissing several claims against DoubleClick. The
parties have since entered into a settlement agreement
dismissing with prejudice the case on behalf of the named
plaintiffs only and dismissing without prejudice all the class
claims. Under the terms of the settlement of the California case
DoubleClick is not required to make any payments and no
restraints are imposed on its business practices. The settlement
of the California case was approved by the court on
January27, 2005. DoubleClick believes the claims in the
Pennsylvania case are without merit and intends to defend these
actions vigorously. NOTE16 Segment Reporting DoubleClick is organized into two segments: TechSolutions and
Data. Our TechSolutions business unit consists of our Ad
Management, Marketing Automation and Performics divisions and
our Data business unit consists of our Abacus and Data
Management divisions. During 2002, through a series of
transactions, DoubleClick divested of its media businesses and
no longer reports a DoubleClick Media segment. In December 2003,
DoubleClick changed its measure of segment profit or loss from
gross profit to operating 83 Table of Contents DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2004 income loss. As a result, DoubleClick has adjusted its prior
period segment disclosures to conform to this new measurement.
Adjustments to reconcile segment reporting to consolidated
results are included in corporate. Corporate

Controls and Procedures Conclusions Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act as of
December31, 2004. The term disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in Rules13a-15e and
15d-15e under the Exchange Act, means controls and other
procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
companys management, including its principal executive and
principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies
its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2004,
the our chief executive officer and chief financial officer
concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. No change in our internal control over financial reporting
occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December31, 2004
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
control over financial reporting is defined in
Rule13a-15f or 15d-15f under the Exchange Act as a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal
executive and principal financial officers and effected by our
board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures
that   
1Pertain to the maintenance of records that in
reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the Company     
2Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company;and     
3Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of the Companys assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004.
In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSOin Internal
Control-Integrated Framework. 88 Table of Contents Based on our assessment, we concluded that, as of
December31, 2004, our internal control over financial
reporting is effective based on those criteria. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an
audit report, which appears under Item8, on our assessment
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting. cChanges in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting No change in our internal control over financial reporting as
defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange
Act occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December31,
2004 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
