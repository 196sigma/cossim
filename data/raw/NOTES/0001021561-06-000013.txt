Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. 
The
Company  Nu
Skin Enterprises, Inc. the Company is a leading, global direct selling
company that develops and distributes premium-quality, innovative personal care products
and nutritional supplements that are sold worldwide under the Nu Skin and Pharmanex
brands. The Company also markets technology-related products and services under the Big
Planet brand. The Company reports revenue from five geographic regions: North Asia, which
consists of Japan and South Korea; Greater China, which consists of China, Hong
Kong, Macau and Taiwan; North America, which consists of the United States and Canada;
South Asia/Pacific, which consists of Australia, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand,
the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand; and Other Markets, which consists of Brazil,
Europe, Guatemala/Central America, Israel and Mexico the Companys subsidiaries
operating in these countries are collectively referred to as the
Subsidiaries. 2.
Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies  Consolidation The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the
Subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in
consolidation. Use of estimates The
preparation of these financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, required management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant
estimates include reserves for product returns, obsolete inventory and taxes. Actual
results could differ from these estimates. Cash and cash equivalents Cash
equivalents are short-term, highly liquid instruments with original maturities of 90 days
or less. Current investments Current
investments consist entirely of auction rate municipal bonds classified as
available-for-sale securities. The Company, through its dealers, purchases and sells these
securities at par value and records them at cost, which approximates fair market value due
to their variable interest rates, which typically reset every 7 to 35 days and despite the
long-term nature of their stated contractual maturities, along with the Companys
investment policy and practice to only invest in high investment grade securities, the
Company has the ability to quickly liquidate these securities. As a result, the Company
has no cumulative gross unrealized holding gains losses or gross realized gains losses
from its current investments. Interest income generated from these current investments is
recorded in other income. Inventories Inventories
consist primarily of merchandise purchased for resale and are stated at the lower of cost
or market, using the first-in, first-out method. The Company had reserves for obsolete
inventory totaling $52 million and $58 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2005,
respectively. 70 Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.

for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Goodwill and other
intangible assets Under
the provisions of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS
142, the Companys goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
are no longer amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually. The
Companys intangible assets with finite lives are recorded at cost and are amortized
over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and are
reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets Note 5. In addition, the Company is required to
make judgments regarding and periodically assesses the useful life of its intangible
assets. Revenue recognition Revenue
is recognized when products are shipped, which is when title and risk of loss pass to
independent distributors who are the Companys customers. A reserve for product
returns is accrued based on historical experience totaling $25 million and $21 million
as of December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. The Company generally requires cash or
credit card payment at the point of sale. The Company has determined that no allowance for
doubtful accounts is necessary. Amounts received prior to shipment and title passage to
distributors are recorded as deferred revenue. The global compensation plan for the
Companys distributors generally does not provide rebates or selling discounts to
distributors who purchase its products and services. The Company classifies selling
discounts, if any, as a reduction of revenue. 71 NU SKIN ENTERPRISES, INC. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Advertising expense Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense incurred for the years ended December
31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 totaled approximately $14 million, $13 million and $24 million,
respectively. Research and development The
Companys research and development activities are conducted primarily through its
Pharmanex division. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and totaled
$64 million, $77 million and $75 million in 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Income taxes The
Company follows the liability method in accounting for income taxes. Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the
enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to
reverse. The Company nets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities by
jurisdiction. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
assets to the amounts expected to be ultimately realized. The Company accounts for any
income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for
Contingencies. Net income per share Net
income per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the periods presented. Additionally, diluted earnings per share data
gives effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the
periods presented Note 10. Earnings per share in 2004 and 2005 were positively impacted
by the repurchase of 108 million shares of the Companys Class A common stock in
October 2003 and the repurchase of 31 million shares of the Companys Class A common
stock in July 2004. Foreign currency
translation Most
of the Companys business operations occur outside the United States. The local
currency of each of the Companys subsidiaries is considered its functional currency.
All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates existing at
the balance sheet dates, revenue and expenses are translated at weighted-average exchange
rates and stockholders equity is recorded at historical exchange rates. The
resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of
stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets and transaction gains and
losses are included in other income and expense in the consolidated financial statements. 72 Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fair value of financial
instruments The
carrying value of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and notes payable approximate fair values. The carrying
amount of long-term debt approximates fair value because the applicable interest rates
approximate current market rates. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in
time, based on relevant market information. Stock-based compensation SFAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123,
encourages, but does not require, companies to record compensation cost for stock-based
employee compensation plans based on the fair market value of options granted. The Company
has chosen to account for stock-based compensation granted to employees using the
intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations.
Accordingly, because the grant price equals the market price on the date of grant for
options issued by the Company, no compensation expense is recognized for stock options
issued to employees. However, stock-based compensation granted to non-employees, such as
the Companys independent distributors and consultants, is accounted for in
accordance with SFAS 123. SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation 
Transition and Disclosure SFAS 148, which amended SFAS 123,
requires more prominent and frequent disclosures about the effects of stock-based
compensation, which have been presented herein. In
December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No.
123R, Share-Based Payment, which requires the expensing of employee options
beginning the first fiscal year that begins after June 15, 2005. Consequently, the Company
will begin expensing employee options during its first quarter of 2006 and anticipates
recording an additional stock option expense of approximately $20 million per quarter in
2006. Through 2005, the Company continued to account for its stock-based compensation
granted to employees according to the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25. Had compensation
cost for the Companys stock options granted to employees been recognized based upon
the estimated fair value on the grant date under the fair value methodology prescribed by
SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148, the Companys net earnings and earnings per share
would have been as follows U.S. dollars in thousands, except per share amounts:

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Reporting comprehensive
income Comprehensive
income is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from
transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, and it includes
all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners
and distributions to owners. Accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities The
Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities, with the instruments
measured at fair value as required by SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133. The
Companys Subsidiaries enter into significant transactions with each other and third
parties that may not be denominated in the respective Subsidiaries functional
currencies. The Company regularly monitors its foreign currency risks and seeks to reduce
its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates using foreign currency exchange
contracts and through certain intercompany loans of foreign currency. The
Company hedges its exposure to future cash flows from forecasted transactions over a
maximum period of 12 months. Hedge effectiveness is assessed at inception and throughout
the life of the hedge to ensure the hedge qualifies for hedge accounting treatment.
Changes in fair value associated with hedge ineffectiveness, if any, are recorded in the
results of operations currently. In the event that an anticipated transaction is no longer
likely to occur, the Company recognizes the change in fair value of the derivative in its
results of operations currently. Changes
in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in current earnings or accumulated other
comprehensive loss, depending on the intended use of the derivative and its resulting
designation. The gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss stemming from
these derivatives will be reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged
forecasted transaction affects earnings. The fair value of the receivable and payable
amounts related to these unrealized gains and losses is classified as other current assets
and liabilities. The Company does not use such derivative financial instruments for
trading or speculative purposes. Gains and losses on certain intercompany loans of foreign
currency are recorded as other income and expense in the consolidated statements of
income. 3. 
Related
Party Transactions  The
Company leases corporate office and warehouse space from two entities that are owned by
certain officers and directors of the Company. Total lease payments to these two
affiliated entities were $33 million, $36 million and $37 million for each of the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 with remaining long-term minimum lease payment
obligations under these operating leases of $235 million and $198 million at December
31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. 73 Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.

The
Companys foreign taxes paid are high relative to foreign operating income and the
Companys U.S. taxes paid are low relative to U.S. operating income due largely to
the flow of funds among the Companys Subsidiaries around the world. As payments for
services, management fees, license arrangements and royalties are made from the
Companys foreign affiliates to its U.S. corporate headquarters, these payments often
incur withholding and other forms of tax that are generally creditable for U.S. tax
purposes. Therefore, these payments lead to increased foreign effective tax rates and
lower U.S. effective tax rates. Variations or shifts occur in the Companys foreign
and U.S. effective tax rates from year to year depending on several factors including the
impact of global transfer prices and the timing and level of remittances from foreign
affiliates. 80 Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.

valuation allowance relating to tax benefits of certain foreign subsidiaries with
operating losses where it is more likely than not, that the deferred tax assets will not
be realized. The Company has available foreign net operating losses that begin expiring in
2006. The
Company is subject to regular audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. These
audits may result in proposed assessments that may result in additional tax liabilities. 81 Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.

The
increase in the effective tax rate in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to an increase in the
amount of nondeductible executive compensation, reconciliation of U.S. and foreign income
tax payable amounts and other nondeductible expenses related to equity compensation. This
decrease in the effective tax rate in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to the Companys
election to permanently reinvest a portion of the Companys earnings from its foreign
operations. The Company anticipates the remittance of these earnings to be postponed
indefinitely. Such earnings would be subject to U.S. taxation if repatriated to the U.S. 13. 
Employee
Benefit Plan  The
Company has a 401k defined contribution plan which permits participating employees to
defer up to a maximum of 15% of their compensation, subject to limitations established by
the Internal Revenue Code. Employees who work a minimum of 1,000 hours per year, who have
completed at least one year of service and who are 21 years of age or older are qualified
to participate in the plan. The Company matches 100% of the first 2% and 50% of the next
2% of each participants contributions to the plan. Participant contributions are
immediately vested. Company contributions vest based on the participants years of
service at 25% per year over four years. The Company recorded compensation expense of $11
million, $13 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and
2005, respectively, related to its contributions to the plan. The
Company has a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in Japan. All employees of Nu
Skin Japan, after certain years of service, are entitled to pension plan benefits when
they terminate employment with Nu Skin Japan. The accrued pension liability was $37
million, $44 million and $45 million as of December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005,
respectively. Although Nu Skin Japan has not specifically funded this obligation, Nu Skin
Japan believes it maintains adequate cash balances for this defined benefit pension plan.
The Company recorded pension expense of $07 million, $08 million and $08 million for
the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. 14.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 15. 
Derivative
Financial Instruments  At
December 31, 2004 and 2005, the Company held forward contracts designated as foreign
currency cash flow hedges with notional amounts totaling approximately $820 million and
$237 million, respectively, to hedge forecasted foreign-currency-denominated intercompany
transactions. All such contracts were denominated in Japanese yen. As of December 31, 2004
and 2005, $32 million of net unrealized loss and $18 million of net unrealized gain, net
of related taxes, respectively, were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The
contracts held at December 31, 2005, have maturities through December 2006, and
accordingly, all unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency cash flow hedges included
in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be recognized in current earnings over the
next 12 months. The pre-tax net losses on foreign currency cash flow hedges recorded in
current earnings were $53 million, $50 million and $03 million for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. During
2003, 2004 and 2005, the Company did not have any gains or losses related to hedging
ineffectiveness. Additionally, no component of gains and losses was excluded from the
assessment of hedging effectiveness. During 2003, 2004 and 2005, the Company did not have
any gains or losses reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash
flow hedges. 16. 
Supplemental
Cash Flow Information  Cash
paid for interest totaled $27 million, $46 million and $56 million for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. The increase in cash paid for interest in
2004, compared to prior years, was due to the additional debt discussed in Note 8. Cash
paid for income taxes totaled $266 million, $73 million and $159 million for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. The increase in cash paid for income
taxes in 2005, compared to prior years, was due primarily to the timing of tax payments in
foreign jurisdictions. 17. 
Segment
Information     The Company operates in a
single operating segment by selling products to a global network of independent distributors that operates in a seamless
manner from market to market, except for its operations in Mainland China. In Mainland China, the Company utilizes an employed sales force to sell its
products through fixed retail locations. Selling expenses are the Company largest expense comprised of the commissions to its worldwide independent

Restructuring
and Other Charges  In
2003, the Company recorded restructuring and other charges of $56 million. These expenses
consisted primarily of severance and other compensation charges. 19. 
Commitments
and Contingencies  The Company is subject to governmental regulations pertaining to product formulation, labeling and packaging, product claims and advertising and to the
Company direct selling system. The Company is also subject to the jurisdiction of numerous foreign tax and customs authorities. Any assertions or
determination that either the Company or the Company distributors is not in compliance with existing statutes, laws, rules or regulations could
potentially have a material adverse effect on the Company operations. In addition, in any country or jurisdiction, the adoption of new statutes, laws,
rules or regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing statutes, laws, rules or regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company
and its operations. Although management believes that the Company is in compliance, in all material respects, with the statutes, laws, rules and
regulations of every jurisdiction in which it operates, no assurance can be given that the Company compliance with applicable statutes, laws, rules and
regulations will not be challenged by foreign authorities or that such challenges will not have a material adverse effect on the Company financial
position or results of operations or cash flows. The Company and its Subsidiaries are defendants in litigation and proceedings involving various matters.
In the opinion of the Company management, based upon advice of its counsel handling such litigation and proceedings, adverse outcomes, if any, will not
likely result in a material effect on the Company consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
The Company is subject to regular audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. These audits may result in additional tax liabilities. The
Company accounts for such contingent liabilities in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies and believes it has appropriately provided
for income taxes for all years. Several factors drive the calculation of our tax reserves. Some of these factors include: i the expiration of various
statutes of limitations; ii changes in tax law and regulations; iii issuance of tax rulings; and iv settlements with tax authorities. Changes in any
of these factors may result in adjustments to the Company reserves, which would impact its reported financial results. The Financial Accounting
Standards Board is currently considering changes to accounting for uncertain tax positions. Because the nature and extent of these changes are not fully
known, the Company is not able to predict the impact on its tax contingency reserves, if any. 84 Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     In 1999, the Company implemented a duty valuation methodology with respect to the importation of certain products into Japan. The Valuation
Department of the Yokohama customs authority reviewed and approved this methodology at that time, and it has been reviewed on several occasions by the
audit division of the Japan customs authority since then. In connection with recent audits, the Yokohama customs authorities have assessed the Company
additional duties and penalties on these products imported into Japan from October 2002 to October 2004, based on a different valuation methodology than
that which was previously approved. The Company has disputed this assessment. The Company has also disputed the amount of duties it was required to pay
on products imported from November of 2004 to June of 2005. The total amount assessed or in dispute is approximately $250 million as of December 31,
2005, net of any recovery of consumption taxes. Effective July 1, 2005, The Company implemented some modifications to its business structure in Japan and
in the United States that it believes will eliminate any further customs valuation disputes with respect to product imports in Japan after that time.
Because the valuation methodology the Company used with respect to the products in dispute was reviewed and approved by the Japan customs authority,
the Company believes the assessments are improper and has filed letters of protest with Yokohama customs authority with respect to this entire amount. The
Yokohama customs authority has not accepted the Company letters of protest to date, and to follow proper administrative procedures the Company has filed
appeals with the Japan Ministry of Finance. To the extent necessary, the Company plans to continue to file protests and appeals within the appropriate
governmental channels concerning this issue. The Company may also choose to use the judicial court system in Japan if necessary to bring this issue to a
resolution. In order to file its letters of protest, the Company was required to pay the $250 million in customs duties and assessments, the amount of
which it recorded in Other Assets in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company has filed requests for refunds for this entire amount along with its
letters of protest. To the extent that the Company is unsuccessful in recovering the amounts assessed and paid, the Company will be required to take a
corresponding charge to its earnings. 85 Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     In Taiwan, the Company is currently subject to an audit by tax authorities with respect to the deductibility of distributor commission expenses in
that market. In order avoid the running of the statute of limitations with respect to the 1999 and 2000 tax years, the Taiwan tax authorities have
disallowed the Company commission expense deductions for those years and assessed the Company a total of approximately $187 million. The Company is
contesting this assessment and is in discussions with the tax authorities in an effort to resolve this matter. Based on its understanding of this matter,
management doesn't believe that it is probable that the Company will incur a loss relating to this matter and acordingly has not provided any related reserves. 20. 
Purchase
of LongTerm Assets     In March 2002, the Company acquired the exclusive rights to a new light-source technology related to measuring the level of certain antioxidants.
The acquisition consisted of cash payments of $48 million including acquisition costs and the issuance of 106,667 shares of the Company Class A common
stock valued at approximately $09 million. In addition, the acquisition included contingent payments of up to $85 million of cash and up to 12 million
shares of the Company Class A common stock if certain development and revenue targets are met.  In 2004, some of these specific development and revenue
targets were met resulting in contingent payments owed of approximately $51 million of cash of which $21 million was paid in 2005 and 525,000 shares
of which 262,500 shares were issued in 2005 of the Company Class A common stock valued at approximately $13 million. During the first half of 2005,
all of the remaining specific development and revenue targets were met. As a result, the Company made the final contingent payments of approximately $34
million of cash and 675,000 shares of the Company Class A common stock valued at approximately $152 million. The total payments of $85 million of cash
and the value of the 12 million shares of stock have been added to the carrying value of other finite lived intangible assets.  21. 
Dividends
per Share  Quarterly
cash dividends for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005 totaled $226 million and
$254 million, respectively. In February 2006, the board of directors declared a quarterly
cash dividend of $010 per share for all classes of common stock to be paid on March 22,
2006 to stockholders of record on March 3, 2006. 22. 
Subsequent
Event                                          On March 7, 2006, the Company acquired Caroderm Inc. for $40 million. As a result of the acquisition, the Company acquired Caroderm license to
use the Scanner technology within the professional medical community. As the sole asset of Caroderm was its
license and field of use rights with respect to the Scanner technology, all the consideration paid will be allocated to that asset and amortized over the
period of the remaining license agreements related to the Scanner. 86    In addition, the Company recently announced plans to implement a restructuring initiative during the first half of 2006 designed to i eliminate
organizational redundancies, ii revamp administrative support functions, iii prioritize investments to favor profitable initiatives and markets, and
iv increase efficiencies in the supply chain process. In connection with this initiative, the Company expects to incur employee severance costs of
approximately $10 to $20 million and $5 million related to various other streamlining intitiatves. Additionally, in February 2006, as a result of the
Company launch of and transition to its second-generation BioPhotonic Scanner, the Company determined it would be necessary to write down the book value
of the existing inventory of the prior model of the Scanner of approximately $20 million. The Company anticipates that approximately $10 to $20 million of
the restructuring charges will result in future cash expenditures. 87 Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.: We have completed integrated audits
of Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.s 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and of
its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 and an audit of its
2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below. Consolidated financial
statements In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, of stockholders
equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial
statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Internal control over
financial reporting Also, in our opinion,
managements assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting appearing in Item 9A, that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated,
in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on managements assessment andon the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements
assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. 88 A companys internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s/

Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15e under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures
are the controls and other procedures that we designed to ensure that we record, process,
summarize and report in a timely manner the information we must disclose in reports that
we file with or submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act.
Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the
period covered by this report. Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During the fourth quarter of 2005,
there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is
defined in Rule 13a-15f under the Exchange Act that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management
Report On Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15f under
the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal
executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors,
management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in this United States of
America and includes those policies and procedures that:  
pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of our assets;  
provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in this
United States of America, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorization of management and directors; and  
provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.  Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. 90 Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal
executive and principal financial officers, we assessed, as of December 31, 2005, the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment was based
on criteria established in the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on
our assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2005. Our

December 31, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in this
