Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The Independent Auditors Report of Deloitte Touche LLP and the
Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of June30, 2004 and 2003,
and for each of the years in the three year period ended June30, 2004, follow 58 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
CheckFree Corporation and Subsidiaries
Norcross, Georgia We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CheckFree
Corporation and Subsidiaries the Company as of June30, 2004 and 2003, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June30, 2004. Our
audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedule listed in
the index at . These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company at June30, 2004 and
2003, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended June30, 2004, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
opinion, such consolidated financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. As described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and

Financial Statements 64 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization - CheckFree Corporation the Company is the parent company of
CheckFree Services Corporation CheckFree Services, the principal operating
company of the business. In April2000, CheckFree Services changed its name
from CheckFree Corporation to CheckFree Services Corporation. Following that
change, in August2000, CheckFree Holdings Corporation changed its name to
CheckFree Corporation. CheckFree Services was organized in 1981 and is a
leading provider of financial electronic commerce products and services. See
Note 20 for a description of the Companys business segments. Principles of Consolidation - The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the results of operations of the Company and its wholly
owned subsidiaries. The Companys majority owned subsidiary, CheckFree
Management Corporation, was merged into CheckFree Services Corporation
effective June30, 2004. All significant intercompany transactions have been
eliminated. Use of Estimates - The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments purchased with maturities of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. Investments - The Company has certain investments in marketable debt securities
that are classified as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity in
accordance with SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities, SFAS 115. The Company began investing in
available-for-sale securities during the quarter ended September30, 2002. All
new non-collateral securities purchased after September1, 2002, have been
classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at
amortized cost and are adjusted only for other-than-temporary declines in fair
value. Available-for-sale investments are recorded at fair value and changes
in fair value are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other
comprehensive income, a component of stockholders equity. Restricted
investments represent amounts that are restricted as to their use in accordance
with leasing arrangements. The Company has certain other investments in equity and debt securities that
are accounted for under the cost method. Under the cost method of accounting,
investments are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other-than-temporary
declines in fair value, distributions of earnings and additional investments.
The Company periodically evaluates whether any declines in fair value of its
investments are other than temporary. In performing this evaluation, the
Company considers various factors including any decline in market price, where
available, the investees financial condition, results of operations, operating
trends and other financial ratios. 65 Table of Contents The Company has received equity instruments in connection with agreements with
certain partners. In such cases, the Companys initial cost is determined
based on the estimated fair value of the equity instruments received.
Subsequent changes in the fair value of these equity instruments are accounted
for in accordance with the investment policies described above. During April2004, the Company formed a joint venture, EBPP, Ltd., with BACS,
Ltd. in the United Kingdom. EBPP, Ltd. is designed to create an integrated
electronic billing and payment network for billers and banks in the United
Kingdom. During the fiscal year ended June30, 2004, the Company invested $12
million in the joint venture out of an initial commitment of approximately
$3,150,000. If certain milestones are achieved, the Company may contribute an
additional $3,150,000 to the joint venture. The Company will account for the
investment in EBPP, Ltd. under the equity method. Settlement Assets and Obligations - Amounts receivable from the Companys
agents and clients, as well as amounts payable to the Companys agents and
clients associated with the Companys walk-in bill payment services, are
classified as settlement assets and obligations. The majority of these assets
and obligations result from timing differences between the Companys agents
collecting funds from the consumers making the payments and depositing the
funds collected into the Companys bank accounts. Settlement assets and
obligations arise due to the Companys reporting of transactions to its clients
prior to fulfilling the payment obligation. Concentrations of Credit Risk - Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, investments and
trade accounts receivable. Excess cash is invested through banks, mutual funds
and brokerage houses primarily in highly liquid securities. The Company has
investment policies and procedures that limit any concentration of credit risk
with single issuers. With respect to accounts receivable, the Company does
not generally require collateral and believes that any credit risk is
substantially mitigated by the nature of our customers and reasonably short
collection terms. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses
on customer accounts when deemed necessary. Derivative
Financial Instruments - On July1, 2000, the Company adopted SFAS
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, as amended, which requires that all derivative financial instruments be
recognized as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. SFAS 133 requires the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet
at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value
through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the
hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the
change in fair value of assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through
earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is
recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivatives change in
fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. Prior to
July1, 2003, the Companys investment policy prohibited the use of
derivatives for trading or hedging purposes. Additionally, the Company
performed reviews of its contracts and determined that they did not contain any
embedded derivatives that require separate reporting and disclosure under
SFAS 133. As such, the adoption of SFAS 133 did not have a material impact on
the Companys financial position or results of operations for the years ended
June30, 2003 and 2002. During
fiscal year 2004, the Company amended its investment policy to allow for
the use of derivative financial instruments in certain instances. This change
was implemented to manage the variability of cash flows related to interest
rate sensitive portions of processing and servicing revenue. The Company does
not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading
purposes. As required by SFAS 133, the Company records all derivatives on the balance
sheet at their fair value. As discussed further in Note 17, all of the
Companys derivative financial instruments have been designated as cash flow
hedges. Under SFAS 133, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of
these cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income within stockholders equity and are subsequently
recognized in earnings when the cash flows of the hedged item impact earnings.
The ineffective portion of changes in fair value is immediately recognized in
earnings. 66 Table of Contents Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost. Property
and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives as follows: land improvements, building and building
improvements, 15 to 30years; computer equipment, software and furniture, 18
months to seven years. Equipment under capital leases is amortized using the
straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the
terms of the leases. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of
the estimated useful lives or remaining lease periods. Capitalized Software - Capitalized software includes purchased technology
intangible assets associated with acquisitions and capitalized internal
development costs. Purchased technology intangibles are initially recorded
based on the fair value ascribed at the time of acquisition. Internal
development costs are capitalized in accordance with the provisions of either
SFAS 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or
Otherwise Marketed, or Statement of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. The
Company determines whether software costs fall under the provisions of SFAS 86
or SOP 98-1 and accounts for them as follows   
SFAS 86 - Software development costs incurred prior to the
establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred.
Software development costs incurred after the technological
feasibility of the subject software product has been established are
capitalized in accordance with SFAS 86. Capitalized software costs
are amortized on a product-by-product basis using either the estimated
economic life of the product on a straight-line basis over three to
five years, or the current year gross product revenue to the current
and anticipated future gross product revenue, whichever is greater.
Unamortized software development costs in excess of estimated future
net realizable values from a particular product are written down to
estimated net realizable value.   
SOP 98-1 - Software costs incurred in the preliminary project stage
are expensed as incurred. Software costs incurred after the
preliminary project stage is complete, management has committed to the
project, and it is probable the software will be used to perform the
function intended are capitalized in accordance with SOP 98-1.
Capitalized software costs are amortized on a product-by-product basis
using the estimated economic life of the product on a straight-line
basis, generally three to five years. Capitalized software costs not
expected to be completed and placed in service are written down to
estimated fair value. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets - Goodwill represents the excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business
combinations accounted for under the purchase method. Goodwill was amortized
on a straight-line basis over five to ten years prior to July1, 2002.
Effective July1, 2002, goodwill is no longer amortized. Other intangibles represent identifiable intangible assets purchased by the
Company in connection with business combinations. The costs of identified
intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over periods
from eight months to ten years. The Company performs its
annual goodwill impairment review on April30 of each year. No
indicators for impairment were evident during the review for fiscal year 2004. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - In accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, SFAS 144, effective July
1, 2002, long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events indicate
that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. In such reviews, estimated
undiscounted future cash flows associated with these assets or operations are
compared with their carrying value to determine if a write-down to fair value
is required normally measured by the expected present value technique.
During the year ended June30, 2003, the Company performed a review of certain
of its long-lived assets, determined that certain assets were impaired and
recorded a charge of $4,245,000 related to the impairment of other intangible
assets. The charge was included in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of
Operations See Note 6 for a description of this review. Transaction Processing - In connection with the timing of the Companys
financial transaction processing, the Company is exposed to credit risk in the
event of nonperformance by other parties, such as returns. The Company
utilizes credit analysis and other controls to manage its credit risk exposure.
The Company also maintains a reserve for 67 Table of Contents future returns. This reserve is included in accrued
liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Comprehensive Income - The Company reports comprehensive income in accordance
with SFAS 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. The Statement requires
disclosure of total non-shareowner changes in equity and its components. Total
non-shareowner changes in equity include all changes in equity during a period
except those resulting from investments by and distributions to shareowners.
The components of other comprehensive income applicable to the Company are
unrealized gains or losses on the Companys available-for-sale securities and
derivative instruments, as well as unrealized foreign currency translation
differences. There were no components of other comprehensive income applicable
to the Company prior to June30, 2002. The Company began investing in
available-for-sale securities during the quarter ended September30, 2002, and
began using derivative instruments in fiscal year 2004. As of June30, 2004,
unrealized foreign currency translation gains of $54,000, gross unrealized
gains of $449,000 offset by gross unrealized losses of $826,000 on the
Companys available-for-sale securities, net of deferred taxes of $139,000, and
the unrealized loss on interest rate swaps of $850,000, net of deferred taxes of
$306,000, have been recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of
Stockholders Equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Stock-Based Compensation - The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in
accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations.
Accordingly, compensation expense is not required to be recorded when stock
options are granted to employees as long as the exercise price is not less than
the fair market value of the stock when the option is granted, and in
connection with our Associate Stock Purchase Plan as long as the purchase price
is not less than 85% of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning or
end of each offer period. In October1995, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
SFAS 123 allows the Company to continue to follow the present APB Opinion 25
guidelines, but requires pro-forma disclosures of net income and earnings per
share as if the Company had adopted the provisions of the Statement. In
December2002, the FASB issued SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB Statement 123,
which provides alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily
changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. SFAS 148 requires prominent disclosure about the effects on
reported net income of an entitys accounting policy decisions with respect to
stock-based employee compensation and amends APB Opinion 28, Interim Financial
Reporting, to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial
information. These disclosure requirements became effective for the Companys
third quarter of fiscal 2003. The Company has continued to account for
stock-based compensation under the provisions of APB Opinion 25 using the
intrinsic value method. Had compensation cost for the Companys stock-based compensation plans been
determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those
plans in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123, the Companys net loss and
net loss per share would have been as follows in thousands, except per share

Stock-Related Transactions With Third Parties - The Company accounts for stock
warrants issued to third parties, including customers, in accordance with the
provisions of the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 96-18, Accounting
for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring,
or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services, and EITF 01-9, Accounting
for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer 68 Table of Contents Including a Reseller of the Vendors Products. Under the provisions of EITF
96-18, because none of the Companys agreements have a disincentive for
non-performance, the Company records a charge for the fair value of the portion
of the warrants earned from the point in time when vesting of the warrants
becomes probable. Final determination of fair value of the warrants occurs
upon actual vesting. EITF 01-9, which became effective during the quarter
ended March31, 2002, requires that the fair value of certain types of warrants
issued to customers be recorded as a reduction of revenue to the extent of
cumulative revenue recorded from that customer. Basic and Diluted Earnings Loss Per Share - The Company reports basic and
diluted earnings lossper share in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
128, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings lossper common share is
determined by dividing income lossavailable to common shareholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted per common share
amounts assume the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive
equivalent shares outstanding. Foreign
Currency Translation - Effective with the acquisition of BlueGill
Technologies, Inc. on April28, 2000, and the acquisition of
HelioGraph, Ltd HelioGraph in
November2003, certain wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company have foreign
operations. As a result, those assets and liabilities outside the United
States are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Consequently, the Company began to utilize pounds sterling as the functional
currency for the United Kingdom in the quarter ended December31, 2003, and the
Canadian dollar as the functional currency for Canada in the quarter ending
March31, 2004. Assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are remeasured using
current and historical exchange rates in accordance with SFAS 52, Foreign
Currency Translation. The translation from the applicable foreign currencies
to U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange
rates in effect at the balance sheet date, historical rates for equity and the
weighted average exchange rates during the period for revenue and expense
accounts. The gains or losses resulting from such translations are included in
other comprehensive income loss. Due to the relatively immaterial nature of
the amounts involved, neither the Companys economic exposure from fluctuations
in foreign exchange rates nor the net translation gains / losses for the years
ended June30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were material. Revenue Recognition - The Companys sources of revenue and methodology of
recognition is as follows   
Processing and servicing - Processing and servicing revenues include
revenues from transaction processing, electronic funds transfer and
monthly service fees on consumer funds transfer services. The Company
recognizes revenue when the services have been performed. Certain customer
agreements include minimum monthly revenue commitments to the Company and,
of those agreements, some have provisions that allow these minimum
commitments to be credited against future services, as defined. The
Company defers any portion of the minimum revenue commitments that it
expects to be credited against future services until the future services
are performed or the credits expire unused. The Companys estimate of
minimums to be credited against future services is primarily based on
customer specific historical experience and volume and growth experience
with other customers.   
As part of processing certain types of transactions, the Company earns
interest from the time money is collected from its customers until the time
payment is made to the applicable merchants. These revenues, which are
generated from trust account balances not included on the Companys
consolidated balance sheets, are included in processing and servicing
revenue and totaled $14,813,000, $20,258,000 and $25,090,000 for the years
ended June30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.   
License fees - The Company recognizes revenue on software transactions
in accordance with SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as
amended by SOP 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions. In accordance
with the provisions of SOP 97-2, the Company recognizes revenue from
software license agreements when there is persuasive evidence that an
arrangement exists, the fee is fixed and determinable, collectibility
is probable and the software has been shipped, provided that no
significant obligation remains under the contract.   
Maintenance fees - Upon receipt of payment, maintenance fee revenue is
recognized ratably over the term of the related contractual support
period, generally 12months. 69 Table of Contents   
Other - Other revenue consists primarily of consulting and training
services. Consulting revenue is recognized as services are performed
and training revenue is recognized upon delivery of the related
service. Customers are billed in accordance with contract terms. Maintenance revenue is
generally billed on an annual basis. The Company records any unrecognizable
portion of billed fees as deferred revenue until such time as revenue
recognition is appropriate. Estimated losses, if any, on contracts are provided for when probable.
Estimated loss provisions are based on excess costs over the revenues earned
from the contract. Credit losses, if any, are contemplated in the establishment
of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Advertising Costs - The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred in
accordance with SOP 93-7, Reporting on Advertising Costs. Advertising
expense for the years ended June30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $3,632,000 3,227,000 and $2,744,000, respectively. Advertising expenses are included in
sales and marketing costs in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Income Taxes - The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires an asset and liability
approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. In accordance
with SFAS 109, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually
for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future
based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the
differences are expected to affect taxable income. Income tax expense
benefitis the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the
change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Business Segments - The Company reports information about its business segments
in accordance with SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information. The Statement defines how operating segments are
determined and requires disclosure of certain financial and descriptive
information about a companys operating segments. See Note 20 for the
Companys segment information. Related
Parties - The Company considers certain entities to be related
parties as defined by SFAS 57, Related Party Disclosures
based on the ability to appoint a member of the board of directors as
well as the level of share ownership. Based on these criteria,
Microsoft Corporation Microsoft and First Data
Corporation FDC are considered related parties in each
of the three years in the period ending June30, 2004. Bank of
America was considered a related party from October 2000 to
January1, 2003. Recent Accounting Pronouncements - On July20, 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 141,
Business Combinations and SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
SFAS 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June30, 2001, to
be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. In addition, it
requires application of the provisions of SFAS 142 for goodwill and other
intangible assets related to any business combinations completed after June30,
2001, but prior to the adoption date of SFAS 142. SFAS 142 changes the
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets. Upon adoption, goodwill is
no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life. Rather,
goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying
a fair-value-based test. All other acquired intangibles are separately
recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through
contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold,
transferred, licensed, or exchanged, regardless of the Companys intent to do
so. Other intangibles are amortized over their useful lives. SFAS 142 became effective for the Company on July1, 2002, and had the
following impacts   
The Company reclassified approximately $1,350,000 of unamortized
workforce in place intangible assets, net of the associated deferred
income taxes, into goodwill.   
After the reclassification above, goodwill was no longer amortized.   
The Company performed a transitional impairment test as of July1,
2002. This impairment test requires the Company to 1identify its
reporting units, 2determine the carrying value of each reporting
unit by assigning assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill
and intangible assets, to those reporting units, and 3determine the
fair value of each reporting unit. If the carrying value of any
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the amount of any goodwill
impairment will be determined through a fair value analysis of each of
the assigned assets excluding goodwill and liabilities. 70 Table of Contents The Company recorded a charge of $2,894,000 for impairment of goodwill
associated with its i-Solutions reporting unit upon the adoption of SFAS 142.
This charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year
ended June30, 2003. Following the transitional impairment test, the Companys
goodwill balances are subject to annual impairment tests using the same process
described above. Refer to Note 6 where the results of the Companys annual
impairment test are discussed. In November2002, FASB Interpretation 45, Guarantors Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others, FIN 45 was issued. This interpretation clarifies
accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantors in interim and annual
financial statements relating to obligations under certain guarantees. FIN 45
requires that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a
guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in
issuing the guarantee. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for
financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December15,
2002. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are
applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after
December31, 2002. The following is a summary of agreements that the Company
has determined to be within the scope of FIN 45 1We warrant that our software products will perform in all material
respects in accordance with our standard published specifications in effect at
the time of delivery of the licensed products to the customer for ninety days.
Additionally, we warrant that our services will be performed consistent with
generally accepted industry standards or specific service levels through
completion of the agreed upon services. If necessary, we would provide for the
estimated cost of product and service warranties based on specific warranty
claims and claim history, however, we have not incurred significant recurring
expense under our product or service warranties. As a result, we believe the
estimated liabilities related to these agreements are not material. 2CheckFree Services Corporation guarantees the obligations of one of its
wholly owned subsidiaries. See Note 8. In
December2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities VIE to address the consolidation issues around certain types of
entities, including special purpose entities. FIN 46R requires a
variable interest entity to be consolidated if the Companys variable interest
i.e., investment in the entity will absorb a majority of the entitys
expected losses and/or residual returns if they occur. Application of this
Interpretation was required in financial statements of public entities that
have interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest
entities for periods ending after December15, 2003. The adoption of this
interpretation had no impact on the Companys financial position or results of
operations for the year ended June30, 2004. In April2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which amends and clarifies
accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under Statement 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 149 is
effective for contracts entered into or modified after June30, 2003. The
adoption of this statement had no impact on the Companys financial position or
results of operations for the year ended June30, 2004. In May2003, the FASB issued SFAS 150, Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity, which
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain
financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
SFAS 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after
May31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim
period beginning after June15, 2003. It is to be implemented by reporting the
cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial
instruments created before the issuance date of the Statement and still
existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption. The adoption of
this statement had no impact on the Companys results of operations or
financial position for the year ended June30, 2004. In
November2002, the EITF reached a consensus
on Issue 00-21, Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. EITF 00-21
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under
which it will perform multiple revenue-generating activities. It also
addresses when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be
divided into separate units of accounting. The guidance in 71 Table of Contents EITF 00-21 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods
beginning after June15, 2003, with early application permitted. Companies may
elect to report the change in accounting as a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle in accordance with APB Opinion 20, Accounting Changes
and SFAS 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements an
amendment of APB Opinion 28. The Company adopted the provisions of EITF
00-21 for all revenue arrangements entered into after June30, 2003. The
adoption of EITF 00-21 did not have an impact on the Companys financial
position, results of operations or liquidity. In January2003, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue 03-1, The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments
which set out to provide guidance on the meaning of other-than-temporary
impairment and its application to investments classified as either
available-for-sale or held-to-maturity under SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities Including Individual Securities and
Investments in Mutual Funds, and investments accounted for under the cost
method or the equity method. In subsequent discussions, the EITF reached a
consensus that certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures should be
required for debt and marketable equity securities classified as
available-for-sale or held-to-maturity under SFAS 115 that are impaired at the
balance sheet date but for which an other-than-temporary impairment has not
been recognized. EITF 03-1 became effective for fiscal years ending after
December15, 2003. The required disclosures pursuant to EITF 03-1 are
included in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Reclassifications - Certain amounts in the prior years financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the 2004 presentation. NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS HelioGraph, Ltd. In
November2003, the Company completed its acquisition of HelioGraph for approximately $18,756,000 in cash. The acquisition added a
financial transactions management solution with straight through processing
and financial messaging expertise to the Companys reconciliation suite
of products, in addition to expanding the Companys international presence.
HelioGraph is part of CheckFree Financial and Compliance Solutions, a business
unit within the Companys software division. In connection with the acquisition
of HelioGraph, the Company recorded a charge of $324,000 for purchased
in-process research and development. The acquisition was treated as a purchase
for accounting purposes, and, accordingly, the assets and liabilities were
recorded based on their fair market values at the date of the acquisition.
Based on the preliminary purchase price allocation, the Company recorded
goodwill of approximately $14,800,000. The values ascribed to acquired

The acquisition was made to penetrate a
part of the electronic billing and payment market in which the Company had not
materially previously participated. APS is part of CheckFrees Electronic
Commerce Division and a leading provider of walk-in bill payments to the
estimated 20% of U.S. consumers who do not typically rely on bank products and
services. The acquisition was treated as a purchase for accounting purposes,
and, accordingly, the assets and liabilities were recorded based on their fair
market values at the date of the acquisition. Based on the preliminary purchase
price allocation, the Company recorded goodwill of approximately $75,000,000.

The fair value of available-for-sale securities is based on quoted market
values. 74 Table of Contents The Company has determined that the unrealized losses in its available-for-sale
investments, comprised of 95 securities, are deemed to be temporary impairments
as of June30, 2004. The Company believes that the unrealized losses generally
are caused by liquidity discounts and increases in the risk premiums required
by market participants rather than an adverse change in cash flows or a
fundamental weakness in the credit quality of the issuer or underlying assets.

In 2004, the Company sold available-for-sale investments of $65,861,000. The
Company recognized gross gains of $247,000 and gross losses of $484,000 on
those sales. No sales of available-for-sale securities occurred during 2003. In April2004, the Company transferred all of its held-to-maturity investments
to the available-for-sale category. Management determined that it no longer had
the positive intent to hold its investment in securities classified as
held-to-maturity for an indefinite period of time due to managements desire to
have more flexibility in managing the investment portfolio. The securities
transferred had a total amortized cost of $43,769,000, fair value of
$43,842,000 and unrealized gross gains of $514,000 and unrealized gross losses
of $441,000 at the time of the transfer. The net unrealized gain of $73,000 was
recorded as other comprehensive income at the time of transfer. As a result of
the reclassification, SFAS 115 prohibits the Company from classifying
securities as held-to-maturity for two years following the transfer. 75 Table of Contents The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities at June30,

The fair value of
held-to-maturity securities is based on quoted market values. During fiscal year 2004, the Company transferred all investments classified as
held-to-maturity to available-for-sale. As a result of the change in
classification, there are no held-to-maturity investments held by the Company
as of
June30, 2004. Other investments - Other investments are accounted for under the cost method
and include common stock, warrants and venture capital initiatives as of June
30, 2004 and 2003. The common stocks and warrants consist of preferred stock
warrants in a non-publicly traded electronic billing related company. The venture
capital entity invests in early to mid-stage financial solutions and technology
companies. The Company has made a commitment to invest $1,000,000 in venture
capital initiatives. Actual contributions are made at the point in time a specific company
in which venture capital will be invested is identified. The fair value of
other investments was approximately $725,000 and $660,000 as of June30, 2004
and 2003, respectively. During the year ended June30, 2003, the Company recorded losses on certain of
its other investments. The losses were the result of the Companys evaluation
of any other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of these investments.
In performing this evaluation, the Company considered various factors including
any decline in market price, where available, the investees financial
condition, results of operations, operating trends and other financial ratios.
Based on these factors, the Company recorded a loss of $3,228,000 for the year
ended June30, 2003. Pledged investments - The Company has pledged certain available-for-sale
investments as collateral for payments due under operating leases and for
standby letters of credit related to operating leases. The total amount of
securities pledged as collateral at June30, 2004 and 2003 was approximately
$3,866,000 and $5,438,000, respectively, of which $3,000,000 was classified as
a restricted investment at June30, 2003. The lease agreement associated with
the 76 Table of Contents restricted investment expired without renewal during the year ended June30,
2004. The operating leases expire at various dates through December31, 2004.
The standby letters of credit expired on September30, 2003, but automatically
renewed through the underlying lease expiration date of September30, 2004. NOTE 4. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Accounts receivable consist of the following in thousands

Trade accounts receivable represents amounts billed to customers. Revenue is
recognized and customers are billed under service agreements as the services
are performed. Unbilled trade accounts receivable result primarily from
extended payment terms not in excess of one year on software license
agreements. For software contracts, revenue is recognized under the provisions
of SOP 97-2 as described in Note 1, and unbilled amounts under those software
contracts are billed on specific dates according to contractual terms. Other
receivables are comprised primarily of interest receivable. The allowance for
doubtful accounts represents managements estimate of uncollectible accounts
receivable. NOTE 5. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT The components of property and equipment are as follows in thousands

of possible impairment of its long-lived assets, primarily goodwill and other
acquired intangible assets, related to its acquisition of BlueGill
Technologies, Inc. currently referred to as CheckFree i-Solutions. The main
indicators of impairment were recent economic conditions, accompanied by
internet-based software industry trends that negatively impacted both
i-Solutions current operations, as well as its expected future growth rates.
The Company first evaluated recoverability under the provisions of SFAS 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets
to Be Disposed Of, by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows of the
i-Solutions business, including an estimated terminal value, to the related
carrying value of its long-lived assets. As a result of this comparison, the
Company determined that the i-Solutions assets were impaired. The amount of
the impairment was then determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the
i-Solutions assets to the related carrying value. The fair value was
determined using a discounted cash flow approach for the net cash flows of the
i-Solutions business and an estimated terminal value. The assumptions
supporting the estimated cash flows, including the discount rate and estimated
terminal value, reflected managements best estimates at the time. As a
result of the fair value test, the Company recorded a charge reducing the
carrying value of CheckFree i-Solutions goodwill by $107,405,000. This amount
was included in impairment of intangible assets in the Companys Consolidated
Statement of Operations for the year ended June30, 2003. CheckFree
i-Solutions is included in the Companys Software business segment. Upon adoption of SFAS 142, the Company performed a transitional impairment test
and recorded a charge of $2,894,000 for impairment of goodwill associated with
i-Solutions. The transitional impairment charge is reflected as a cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principles in the accompanying Consolidated
Statement of Operations for the year ended June30, 2003. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June30, 2003, the Company
performed its annual impairment review for goodwill and other intangible
assets. The conditions which gave rise to indications of impairment during the
year ended June30, 2002, continued to be present during the year ended June
30, 2003. As a result of its assessment, the Company recorded an additional
charge of $10,228,000, which represents a SFAS 142 goodwill impairment of
$5,983,000 and a SFAS 144 impairment of other intangible assets of $4,245,000
both related to the Companys i-Solutions reporting unit. This amount is
included in impairment of intangible assets in the Companys Consolidated
Statement of Operations. TransPoint During the year ended June30, 2002, the Company performed a review of the
carrying value of technology assets it acquired as part of the TransPoint
acquisition in September2000. The review was prompted by the termination of
the maintenance agreement for this technology from the last of our
international partners, and the conclusions reached by the Company in
evaluating the service potential of the technology against our present and
future initiatives. As a result of the review, the Company identified two
technologies for which there was no future use and recorded a SFAS 121 charge
of $47,667,000 to retire these assets. The charge was included in impairment
of intangible assets in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations for
the year ended June30, 2002. The retirement of the TransPoint technology assets noted above was an indicator
to the Company of possible impairment of its long-lived assets, primarily
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, related to its acquisition of
TransPoint. The Company evaluated the recoverability of all its Electronic
Commerce Division long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted
cash flows of the division, including an estimated terminal value, to the
carrying value of its long-lived assets. The assumptions supporting the
estimated cash flows, including the estimated terminal value, reflected
managements best estimates at the time. The result of this test indicated
that there was no impairment of the Companys Electronic Commerce Division
long-lived assets. 78 Table of Contents In connection with the TransPoint acquisition, we entered into commercial
agreements with Microsoft and FDC to provide payment processing services. These agreements included
minimum revenue commitments totaling $1800million over five years. The
monthly minimum commitments from Microsoft and FDC increase over the five-year
term of the agreements. Currently, Microsoft and FDC are each operating
substantially below their minimum monthly commitments and the Company does not
expect these customers to increase their activity such that they would operate
above the minimum commitments in the next twelve months. The
Company performed its annual goodwill impairment review as of April30, 2004, for
the year ended June30, 2004. No indicators of impairment were evident based on
this review. As of June30, 2004 and 2003, the Companys only non-amortizing intangible
asset is goodwill. The changes in the carrying value of goodwill by segment
for the year ended June30, 2004, were as follows in thousands

by the Company in August2003 in anticipation of obtaining a new line of credit
facility. No amounts were outstanding under the line at June30, 2003. In August2003, CheckFree Corporations wholly owned subsidiaries, CheckFree
Services and Bastogne, Inc., a bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity
Bastogne, entered into a Master Agreement with SunTrust Bank, Atlanta,
Georgia with respect to the activities of CheckFree Services Electronic
Commerce Division. Under this Master Agreement, SunTrust provides Automated
Clearing House ACH and other electronics funds transfer services, on behalf
of Bastogne in connection with the receipt, investment, custody and
transmission of subscriber funds. In addition, SunTrust Bank and its
affiliates provide various deposit accounts and investment accounts and
services to Bastogne. CheckFree Services provides processing and
administrative services to Bastogne to facilitate transactions under the Master
Agreement. SunTrust has agreed to provide a facility to Bastogne to cover overdrafts
occurring from time to time due to timing differences between transmission of
subscriber funds and movement of funds from Bastognes investment accounts to
the zero balance demand deposit account maintained by Bastogne with SunTrust.
In addition, SunTrust provides ACH services, and maintains and permits Bastogne
to use SunTrusts MasterCard ICA transit number and VISA bank identification
numbers to facilitate transactions in the MasterCard and VISA systems. The
obligations of Bastogne under the Master Agreement to SunTrust are guaranteed
by CheckFree Services, which has pledged substantially all the assets of its
Electronic Commerce Division to secure such guarantee. NOTE 9. CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES On November29, 1999, the Company issued $172,500,000 of 65% convertible

interest on a monthly basis equal to the then current overnight repurchase
agreement rate. The deposit is reflected as a long-term liability in the
Companys financial statements. There are no restrictions on the deposit, and
the funds are available for general corporate use. The deposit will be
refunded to the customer upon termination of the agreement. NOTE 11. COMMITMENTS Operating Leases - The Company leases office space and equipment under

82 Table of Contents The Company has pledged certain available-for-sale investments as collateral
for payments due under operating leases and for standby letters of credit
related to operating leases. The total amount of securities pledged at June
30, 2004 and 2003 was approximately $3,866,000 and $5,438,000, respectively. A
deposit in the amount of $3,000,000, was classified as a restricted investment
as of June30, 2003 until the lease associated with such deposit expired during
fiscal year 2004. The operating leases expire at various dates through
December31, 2004. The standby letter of credit expired on September30, 2003,
but automatically renewed through the underlying lease expiration date of
September30, 2004. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into the following
guarantees related to its walk-in bill payment operations. The transmittal of
consumer funds for two customers is guaranteed. The Company has issued bonds
and letters of credit totaling $208million on behalf of consumers in the
event that consumer funds are not remitted to billers. Historically, payments
made related to settling claims under these arrangements have not been
significant. As a result, we believe the estimated fair value of any unsettled
claims is nominal. Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded for these
arrangements as of June30, 2004. NOTE 12. CAPITAL STOCK On November1, 2000, the Companys stockholders approved an increase in the
number of authorized shares of the Company from 165,000,000 to 550,000,000,
consisting of 500,000,000 shares of common stock, $01 par value, 48,500,000
shares of preferred stock, $01 par value, and 1,500,000 shares of SeriesA
Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, $01 par value. The preferred
stock may be issued in one or more series and may be established with such
relative voting, dividend, redemption, liquidation, conversion and other
powers, preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions as
the Board of Directors may determine without further stockholder approval. No
preferred shares have been issued through June30, 2004. In January1997, the Companys Board of Directors declared a dividend
distribution of Preferred Share Purchase Rights Rights to protect its stockholders in
the event of an unsolicited attempt to acquire the Company. On February14,
1997, the Rights were issued to the Companys stockholders of record, with an
expiration date of 10years. Until a person or group acquires 15% or more of
the Companys Common Stock, the Rights will automatically trade with the shares
of Common Stock. Only when a person or group has acquired 15% or more of the
Companys Common Stock, will the Rights become exercisable and separate
certificates issued. Prior to the acquisition by a person or group of
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Companys Common Stock, the Rights
are redeemable for $001 per Right at the option of the Board of Directors. NOTE 13. TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING EQUITY INSTRUMENTS Employee Plans During 1995, the Company adopted the 1995 Stock Option Plan the 1995 Plan.
The options granted under the 1995 Plan may be either incentive stock options
or non-statutory stock options. The terms of the options granted under the
1995 Plan are at the sole discretion of a committee of members of the Companys
Board of Directors, not to exceed ten years. Generally, options vest at either
33% or 20% per year from the date of grant. The 1995 Plan originally provided
that the Company may grant options for not more than 5,000,000 shares of common
stock to certain key employees, officers and directors. In November of 1998
and again in November of 2000, the 1995 Plan was amended by a vote of
the Companys shareholders to extend the maximum option grants to not more than
8,000,000 shares and not more than 12,000,000 shares, respectively. Options
granted under the 1995 Plan are exercisable according to the terms of each
option, however, in the event of a change in control or merger as defined, the
options shall become immediately exercisable. In November2002, the Companys stockholders approved the 2002 Stock Incentive
Plan the 2002 Plan. Under the provisions of the 2002 Plan, the Company may
grant incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights
SARs, restricted stock, performance units or performance shares for not
more than 6,000,000 shares of common stock to certain key employees, officers
and non-employee directors. The terms of the options, SARs, restricted stock,
performance units or performance shares granted under the 2002 Plan are
determined by a committee of the 83 Table of Contents Companys Board of Directors, however, in the event of a change in control as
defined in the 2002 Plan, they shall become immediately exercisable. The 2002
Plan will replace the Companys 1995 Stock Option Plan the 1995 Plan, going
forward, except that the 1995 Plan will continue to exist to the extent that
options granted prior to the effective date of the 2002 Plan continue to remain
outstanding. At June30, 2004, 3,681,535 additional shares are available for
grant under the 2002 Plan. All options granted under the 2002 Plan and the 1995 Plan were granted at
exercise prices not less than the fair market value of the underlying common
stock at the date of grant. In the event that shares purchased through the
exercise of incentive stock options are sold within one year of exercise, the
Company is entitled to a tax deduction. The tax benefit of the deduction is
not reflected in the consolidated statements of operations but is reflected as
an increase in additional paid-in capital. The following table summarizes stock option activity from July1, 2001 to June

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in the years ended June30, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively: dividend yield of 0% in all periods; expected volatility of 61 95% and 98%; risk-free interest rates of 295%, 347% and 400%; and expected
lives of two to seven years. 84 Table of Contents In June2003, the Company made an offer the Tender Offer to certain
employees to exchange options with exercise prices greater than or equal to
$4400 per share currently outstanding under the Companys 1983 Incentive Stock
Option Plan, 1983 Non-Statutory Stock Option Plan, 1993 Stock Option Plan,
Third Amended and Restated 1995 Stock Option Plan, BlueGill Technologies, Inc.
1997 Stock Option Plan, BlueGill Technologies, Inc. 1998 Incentive and
Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, and 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, for restricted
stock units of the Companys Common Stock, and in certain cases, cash payments.
Restricted stock units issued under the Tender Offer will vest ratably over a
three-year period. The offer period closed on July17, 2003, and employees
holding 1,165,035 options participated in the Tender Offer. The Company made
cash payments totaling $586,000 in July2003 representing the cash
consideration portion of the Tender Offer, and the Company will issue
approximately 241,000 shares of restricted stock under the 2002 Stock Incentive
Plan over the next three years. The Company will record an expense for cash
payments as incurred and will record an expense for restricted shares, subject
to cancellation, ratably over the vesting period. The Company recorded an
expense of $2,994,000 for the year ended June30, 2004, for cash payments made
and the vesting of restricted stock units. There was no financial impact to
the Company for the year ended June30, 2003. On July19, 2004, the Company
issued 51,143 shares relating to the portion of the tender offer that vested on
July17, 2004. In total 80,588 shares actually vested of which 29,445 shares
were retained by the Company to fund the payroll taxes associated with the
Plan. Under the 1997 Associate Stock Purchase Plan, effective for the six-month
period beginning January1, 1997, the Company is authorized to issue up to
1,000,000 shares of Common Stock to its full-time employees, nearly all of whom
are eligible to participate. In November2002, the Companys stockholders
approved an increase in the number of shares reserved and available for sale
under the 1997 Associate Stock Purchase Plan from 1,000,000 shares to 2,000,000
shares. Under the terms of the Plan, employees can choose, every six months,
to have up to 15% of their salary withheld to purchase the Companys Common
Stock. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower of its
beginning-of-period or end-of-period market price. Participation in the plan
by eligible employees has ranged from 25% to 50% in any given six-month period.
Under the Plan, 72,293 shares were issued in July2004, 74,952 in January
2004, 98,741 in July2003, 128,033 in January2003, 128,443 in July2002 and
135,721 in January2002 from employees salary withholdings from the respective
previous six-month period. As of June30, 2004, there were 957,081 shares
available for future issuance to the Associate Stock Purchase Plan. Following is a summary of the weighted average fair market value of the
look-back feature estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model, and the related assumptions used

In the year ended June30, 2000, the Company issued 13,000 shares of restricted
stock to certain of its key employees. Under the terms of the grants, full
vesting of the shares was dependent upon the continued employment of the
employee for the duration of the vesting period. Shares issued were recorded
at fair market value on the date of the grant with a corresponding charge to
stockholders equity. The unearned portion was amortized as compensation
expense on a straight-line basis over the related vesting period. In the year
ended June30, 2003, 12,000 shares of restricted stock were forfeited and
returned when a key employee left the Company. 85 Table of Contents In January1997, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Companys
401k plan, which authorized up to 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock for the
Companys matching contribution. The Board of Directors authorized an
additional 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock for the Companys matching
contribution in November2002. The Company issued 149,844 shares in August
2003, 402,102 shares in August2002 and 132,887 shares in August2001 to fund
its 401k match that had accrued during the years ended June30, 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively. As of June30, 2004, there were 1,073,953 shares
available for future contributions to the 401k plan. In August2004, the
Company issued 108,484 shares to fund its 401k match for fiscal year ended
June30, 2004. Stock Related Transactions With Third Parties - In October2000, the Company
completed an agreement to acquire various electronic billing and payment assets
from Bank of America in exchange for ten million shares of the Companys Common
Stock, $350million in cash and warrants to acquire an additional ten million
shares of the Companys Common Stock. In connection with a December2003
modification of the terms of the processing services agreement with Bank of
America, the amount of shares available under the warrants was reduced to five
million. Bank of America has the ability to earn warrants on up to five
million shares, three million of which vest upon achievement of specific levels
of active subscriber adoption of electronic billing and payment services and
two million of which vests upon achievement of specific levels of electronic
bills presented to those subscribers. The warrants have a strike price of
$3250. At the time that vesting of a portion of these warrants becomes
probable, the Company will record a charge for the fair value of the portion of
the warrants earned to date based on Bank of Americas progress towards
achieving the milestones set forth in the agreement. The Company will continue
to record a charge each period for any additional portion of the warrants
earned, plus any change in fair value of the cumulative amount of warrants
earned to date, up to the point in time that the milestones are achieved and
actual vesting occurs. Any charge associated with these warrants will be
recorded as a reduction of revenue up to the aggregate amount of revenue
received from Bank of America. In October1999, the Company entered into an agreement with one of its
customers. Under the terms of the agreement, the customer purchased 250,000
shares of the Companys stock and has been issued warrants on one million
shares. All warrants reflect a strike price of $3925 and became exercisable on
September15, 2002. During the quarter ended June30, 2002, vesting of the
warrants for one million shares became probable. As such, the Company recorded
a non-cash charge to revenues of $2,748,000 for the fair value of the portion
of the warrants earned through June30, 2002 based on a Black-Scholes option
pricing model valuation. At September15, 2002, upon actual vesting, the
Company determined the final fair value of the one million warrants taking into
consideration the market value of our stock at that date. During the quarter
ended September30, 2002, the Company recorded a non-cash increase in revenue
of $644,000, reflecting the portion of the warrants earned during the quarter
and the final fair value of the one million warrants that vested on September
15, 2002. Fair value was determined based on a Black-Scholes option pricing
model valuation. In January1998, the Company entered into a ten-year processing agreement with
a strategic partner. Under the terms of the agreement, the partner acquired
ten-year warrants exercisable at $20 15/16 for ten million shares of the
Companys Common Stock. Three million warrants vested upon the execution of a
related processing outsourcing agreement on March9, 1998. During the year
ended June30, 2001, the strategic partners business was dissolved, and
therefore, it does not have the ability to earn any of the remaining seven
million warrants. During each of the fiscal years ended June30, 2000 and
2001, the strategic partner exercised 750,000 of the vested warrants and
1,500,000 remain outstanding at June30, 2004. In March1997, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with a third
party. Under the terms of the agreement, the consultant acquired 5-year
options exercisable at $1300 for up to 50,000 shares of the Companys Common
Stock. In June1998, upon the execution of a processing agreement with a key
customer, 25,000 of the options vested. The remaining 25,000 options vested in
March2002. In March2002, the consultant exercised all 50,000 options. Any
shares acquired by the consultant under the terms of the agreement are subject to certain transfer restrictions. 86 Table of Contents NOTE 14. EARNINGS PER SHARE The following table reconciles the differences in income and shares outstanding

Anti-dilution provisions of SFAS 128 require consistency between diluted
per-common-share amounts and basic per-common-share amounts in loss periods.
Had the Company recognized net income, an additional 3,567,000 and 3,333,000 of
in-the-money options and warrants would have been included in the diluted
earnings per share calculation for the years ended June30, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Using the treasury stock method prescribed by SFAS 128, this
would have increased diluted shares outstanding by 747,000 and 899,000 for the
years ended June30, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the years ended June
30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, also exclude the effect of approximately 3,222,000,
6,411,000 and 6,565,000 of out-of-the-money options and warrants, respectively.
In addition, the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for
fiscal years 2003 and 2002 exclude the 2,357,000 share effect for the assumed
conversion of the convertible subordinated notes, as their effect would be
anti- dilutive. The after-tax effect of interest expense on the convertible
subordinated notes for the years ended June30, 2003 and 2002 has not been
added back to the numerator, as its effect would be anti-dilutive. The
convertible subordinated notes were redeemed in December2003. NOTE 15. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Retirement Plan - The Company has a defined contribution 401k retirement plan
covering substantially all of its U.S.-based employees. Under the plan,
eligible employees may contribute a portion of their salary until retirement
and the Company, at its discretion, may match a portion of the employees
contribution. In January2002, the Company added a similar plan covering
substantially all its non U.S.-based employees. Total expense under both plans
amounted to $3,009,000, $3,476,000 and $3,035,000 for the years ended June30,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Pension Plan - The Company has a defined contribution pension plan for eligible
United Kingdom employees. Total contributions amounted to $130,000, $56,000 and
$37,000 for the years ended June30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Deferred Compensation Plan - In January1999, the Company established a
deferred compensation plan the DCP covering highly compensated employees as
defined by the DCP. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute a
portion of their salary on a pre-tax basis. The DCP is a non-qualified plan,
therefore the associated liabilities are included in the Companys June30,
2004 and 2003 Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the Company has
established a rabbi trust to finance obligations under the DCP with
corporate-owned life insurance policies on participants. The cash surrender
value of such policies is also included in the Companys June30, 2004 and 2003
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total expense under the DCP for the years ended
June30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 amounted to $161,000, $131,000 and $176,000,
respectively. 87 Table of Contents Group Medical Plans - Effective January1, 2000, the Company converted all of
its U.S.-based employees to a group medical self-insurance plan. The Company
has employed an administrator to manage this plan. Under terms of this plan,
both the Company and eligible employees are required to make contributions.
The administrator reviews all claims filed and authorizes the payment of
benefits. The Company has stop-loss insurance coverage on all individual
claims exceeding $250,000. Prior to January1, 2000, the Company had a group
medical self-insurance plan covering certain of its employees, and medical
insurance coverage under managed care health plans covering the remaining
employees. The Company provides supplemental medical insurance coverage to its
non U.S.-based employees. Total
expense for medical insurance coverage including premiums amounted to
$13,014,000, $11,454,000 and $11,588,000 for the years ended June30, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. Under the self-insurance plan, the Company
expenses amounts as claims are incurred and recognizes a liability for incurred
but not reported claims. At June30, 2004 and 2003, the Company accrued
$2,924,000 and $3,425,000, respectively, as a liability for costs incurred but
not paid under this plan. In December1998, a subsidiary, CheckFree Management Corporation, was created
to administer the Companys employee medical benefits program. The Company
owns a controlling interest in the subsidiary and, therefore, the accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the subsidiarys results of
operations. On June30, 2004, CheckFree Management Corporation was legally
merged into CheckFree Services Corporation. NOTE 16. REORGANIZATION CHARGE During the year ended June30, 2002, the Company announced it would streamline
operations in its Electronic Commerce Division, refine its strategy for the
i-Solutions business unit of its Software Division, and discontinue certain
product lines associated with its Investment Services Division. As a result of
these actions, the Company closed or consolidated operations in several
locations and eliminated certain other positions in the Company. The
streamlining of its Electronic Commerce Division operations results from
efficiencies gained from the consolidation of three legacy transaction
processing platforms to its Genesis platform and resulted in the closing of its
San Francisco, California location on April30, 2002; its Houston, Texas
location on June30, 2002; and its Austin, Texas location on September30,
2002. The refinement in strategy for the i-Solutions business resulted in the
closing of its Ann Arbor, Michigan and Singapore locations on March19, 2002.
Revenues and operating income related to the discontinued product lines in the
Investment Services Division are immaterial to the Company. As a result of these actions, the Company recorded $16,365,000 of
reorganization charges for the year ended June30, 2002, which included
$1,640,000 of non-cash asset impairment charges, $10,962,000 of severance and
related benefits costs for the termination of 707 employees, and $3,763,000 of
other exit costs, including lease termination fees and other closure, employee
and professional costs. For the year ended June30, 2003, the Company reviewed
its estimated remaining liabilities under this reorganization plan and recorded
an additional charge of $1,405,000, which includes $165,000 of severance and
related benefits and $1,240,000 of other exit costs, including lease
termination fees and other closure, employee and professional costs. These
amounts are included in reorganization charge in the Companys Consolidated
Statement of Operations. The Company expects the reorganization to be
completed by October2005 and anticipates no additional charges. 88 Table of Contents A summary of activity related to the reorganization reserve is as follows in

In conjunction with the reorganization activities described above, the Company
revised the estimated useful lives of the Existing Product Technology and
Customer Relationships intangible assets related to the product lines that were
to be discontinued from its Mobius Group acquisition, the Workforce intangible
asset from its strategic agreement with Bank
of America, and certain property and equipment assets associated with office
locations that were to be closed. This resulted in additional amortization
expense of $1,035,000 for the year ended June30, 2003, which represents an
after-tax impact of $621,000 and an impact to earnings per share of $001 for
the year ended June30, 2003, and additional depreciation and amortization
expense of $3,318,000 for the year ended June30, 2002, which represents an
after-tax impact of $2,710,000 and an impact to earnings per share of $003
for the year ended June30, 2002. NOTE 17. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to the
variability associated with the interest rate sensitive portion of processing
and servicing revenue, specifically, to effectively fix the interest rate on a
portion of its interest rate sensitive revenue. At inception, the Company
formally designates and documents its swaps as cash flow hedges of the
variability in interest rate sensitive revenue and states the risk management
objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction. The Company formally assesses, both at inception and on an ongoing basis,
whether the swap is highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of
the underlying interest rate sensitive revenue. The critical terms of the
interest rate swap and the hedged interest rate sensitive revenue are the same.
Accordingly, there is no ineffectiveness relating to these interest rate
swaps. Pursuant to SFAS 133, the effective portion of changes in the fair
value of these interest rate swaps are recorded, net of tax, as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income. Any ineffectiveness of the cash flow
hedge would be reclassified to processing and servicing revenue as earnings
are affected by the cash flow variability of the underlying interest rate
sensitive revenue. On April23, 2004, the Company entered into three interest rate swap
agreements. Each swap agreement has a notional amount of $25,000,000 and an
average life of 194years. Changes in fair value of the net asset liabilityrelated to the Companys
cash flow hedges included in other comprehensive income lossare summarized
as follows after-tax, in thousands

89 Table of Contents Approximately $76,000 of the ending balance of deferred net losses associated
with cash flow hedges are expected to be reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months. The Company
expects that the amount reclassified will generally offset the anticipated
change in earnings relating to the variability of the cash flows of the
underlying interest rate sensitive revenue. The maximum length of time over
which the Company is hedging is 4years. NOTE 18. INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting
for Income Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach to financial
accounting and reporting for income taxes. In accordance with SFAS 109,
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future
based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the
differences are expected to affect taxable income. Income tax expense
benefitis the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the
change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Companys income tax expense benefitconsists of the following in

At June30, 2004, the Company has approximately $146,000,000 of state and
$38,000,000 of federal net operating loss carryforwards available, expiring in
2005 to 2024 and 2019 to 2024, respectively. Additionally, at June30, 2004,
the Company has approximately $500,000 of state, $12,600,000 of federal and
$1,400,000 of foreign tax credit carryforwards available, expiring in 2008 to
2013, 2018 to 2024 and 2007 to 2009, respectively. The realization of the Companys deferred tax assets, which relate primarily to
net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences is dependent on
generating sufficient taxable income in future periods. At each year end, the
Company evaluates the recoverability of its operating loss carryforwards and
research tax credits. Based on an evaluation of expected future profitability,
management determined that is was more likely than not that certain of its
foreign research tax credits would not be recovered. Accordingly, the Company
established a valuation allowance of $1,114,000 representing that portion of
the foreign research credit which may not be utilized. 91 Table of Contents NOTE 19. SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION

Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures
are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information we are
required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management, with
the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures pursuant to Rule13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based
upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were 1designed
to ensure that material information relating to our company is accumulated and
made known to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, in a timely manner, particularly during the period in which
this report was being prepared and 2effective, in that they provide
reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules
and forms. Management believes, however, that a controls system, no matter how well
designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of
the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control and instances of fraud, if any, within a company
have been detected. Internal Controls. There has been no change in our internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f promulgated
under the Exchange Act during our fiscal quarter ended June30, 2004, that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
