To SportsLine.com, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
SportsLine.com, Inc. a Delaware corporation, formerly SportsLine USA, Inc.,
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of SportsLine.com, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999, in conformity with auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue recognition policies for advertising, e-commerce, membership
and premium services and content licensing are set forth below.
Advertising Revenue
Advertising revenue is derived from the sale of advertising on the
Company Web sites. Advertising revenue is recognized in the period the
advertisement is displayed, provided that no significant Company obligations
remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Company
obligations typically include guarantees of a minimum number of impressions,
or times that an advertisement is viewed by users of the Company Web sites.
Amounts received or billed for which impressions have not yet been delivered are
reflected as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
E-Commerce Revenue
E-commerce revenue is derived from the sales of limited edition
memorabilia, licensed apparel, golf equipment and other sports-related products.
E-commerce revenue is recognized once the product has been shipped and payment
is assured.
Membership and Premium Services Revenue
In January 1999, the Company launched SportsLine Rewards, a program
which offers bonus points to members for viewing pages and making purchases.
These points can be redeemed for discounts on merchandise, special events and
other premium items. For additional fees, members are also eligible to
participate in sports contests to win cash prizes and merchandise. The Rewards
program offers only yearly memberships and thus are recognized ratably over the
life of the membership agreement.

amounts in thousands, except share and per share data 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Revenue relating to monthly memberships is recognized in the month the
service is provided. Revenue relating to yearly memberships and sports contests
is recognized ratably over the life of the membership agreement or contest
period. Accordingly, amounts received for which services have not yet been
provided are reflected as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets.
Content Licensing Revenue
Content licensing revenue is derived from the licensing of certain of
the Company content to third parties. Content licensing revenue is recognized
over the period of the license agreement as the Company delivers content.
Barter Transactions
The Company recognizes advertising and content licensing revenue as a
result of barter transactions primarily with certain other Internet-related
companies. Such revenue is recognized based on the fair value of the
consideration received, which generally consists of advertising displayed on the
other companies' Web sites. Barter revenue and the corresponding expense is
recognized in the period the advertising is displayed.
Revenue by Type
Revenue by type for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 is
as follows                                   YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
1999        1998       1997

$60,278      $30,551     $12,014
Barter transactions, in which the Company received advertising or other
services or goods in exchange for content or advertising on its Web sites,
accounted for approximately 17%, 19% and 19% of total revenue for the years
ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
COST OF REVENUE
Cost of revenue consists primarily of content and royalty fees, cost of
merchandise sold, payroll and related expenses for the editorial and operations
staff, telecommunications and computer-related expenses for the support and
delivery of the Company services. Royalty payments are paid to certain content
providers and technology and marketing partners based on membership levels
subject, in certain instances, to specified minimum amounts.
SALES AND MARKETING
Sales and marketing expense consists of salaries and related expenses,
advertising, marketing, promotional, business development, public relations
expenses and member acquisition costs. Member acquisition costs consist
primarily of the direct costs of member solicitation, including advertising on
other Web sites and Internet search engines and the cost of obtaining qualified
prospects from direct marketing programs and third parties. No indirect costs
are included in member acquisition costs. In accordance with American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants AICPA Statement of Position, 93-7, Reporting
on Advertising Costs, the Company may in the

future capitalize such direct-response advertising costs if historical evidence
is available to indicate that the advertising results in a future benefit. Until
that time, all such costs are expensed as incurred. All other advertising and
marketing costs are charged to expense at the time the advertising takes place.
PER SHARE AMOUNTS
In February 1997, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 128, Earnings Per Share, was issued. SFAS No. 128 simplifies the methodology
of computing earnings per share and requires the presentation of basic and
diluted earnings per share. The Company basic and diluted earnings per share
are the same, since the Company common stock equivalents are antidilutive. The
Company previously outstanding convertible preferred stock was converted upon
completion of the Company initial public offering IPO in November 1997.
Accordingly, such shares have been reflected as common stock for all periods
prior to the IPO. SFAS No. 128 was adopted as of December 31, 1997.
Net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of
common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period.
Common equivalent shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon
conversion of all convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method
and shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants using the
treasury stock method. There were approximately 7,711,000, 5,187,000 and
3,475,000 options and warrants outstanding at December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively, that could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future.
Such options and warrants were not included in the computation of diluted loss
per share because to do so would have been antidilutive for all periods
presented.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company financial instruments, primarily consisting of cash and
cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, restricted cash
equivalents, accounts payable and Convertible Subordinated Notes, approximate
fair value due to their short-term nature and/or market rates of interest.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company cash
management and investment policies restrict investments to low risk,
highly-liquid securities and the Company performs periodic evaluations of the
credit standing of the financial institutions with which it deals. Accounts
receivable from customers outside the United States increased due to the
acquisition of the European subsidiary but are not material. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations and generally requires no collateral. The
Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts and such losses have not
been significant. The allowance for doubtful accounts amounted to $423 and $230
at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, and its activity is as follows                    45

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company follows the provisions of SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, was
issued. SFAS No. 121 requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived
assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the
undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than
the carrying amount of the assets. SFAS No. 121 also addresses the accounting
for long-lived assets that are expected to be disposed of.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
In October 1995, SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
was issued. SFAS No. 123 allows either adoption of a fair value based method of
accounting for employee stock options and similar equity instruments or
continuation of the measurement of compensation cost relating to such plans
using the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The
Company has elected to continue to use the intrinsic value based method.
Accordingly, pro forma disclosures required to be presented by SFAS No. 123 for
companies continuing to utilize the intrinsic value based method are presented
in Note 6.
SEGMENT REPORTING
The Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information for the year ended December 31, 1998. SFAS
No. 131 establishes standards for the way public business enterprises report
information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires
those enterprises to report selected information about operating segments in
interim financial reports issued to stockholders.
Beginning in the third quarter of 1999, the Company began operating in
two segments. The following information is disclosed, per SFAS No. 131, based on
the method management uses to organize financial information for making
operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company currently has two
principal business segments: United States and Europe.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
The Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income,
during the year ended December 31, 1998. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for
the reporting and display of comprehensive income loss and its components in a
full set of financial statements. The objective of SFAS No. 130 is to report
comprehensive income loss, a measure of all changes in equity of an enterprise
that result from transactions and other economic events in a period, other than
transactions with owners. The Company has elected to disclose comprehensive
income loss in the consolidated statements of shareholders' equity.
In June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities-Deferral of FASB Statement No. 133. SFAS No. 137 defers for one year
the effective date of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 will now apply to all fiscal quarters of all
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS No. 133 will require the
Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet as either assets or
liabilities measured at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be
adjusted to fair value through income. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 133
effective for the year ended December 31, 2001. The Company believes that the
adoption of SFAS No. 133 will not have a material impact on its consolidated
financial statements, as it has entered into no derivative contracts and has no
current plans to do so in the future.
The Company adopted SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use effective January 1, 1999. SOP
98-1 establishes criteria for determining which costs of developing or obtaining
internal-use computer software should be charged to expense and which should be
capitalized. Such adoption did not have a material effect on the Company
financial position or results of operations.

aggregate principal amount of 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 the
Convertible Subordinated Notes. The Convertible Subordinated Notes are
convertible, at the holder option, into the Company common stock at an
initial conversion rate of 15355 shares of common stock per $1000 principal

Subordinated Notes are unsecured and are subordinated to all existing and future
Senior Indebtedness as defined in the Convertible Subordinated Notes indenture
of the Company. The Convertible Subordinated Notes may not be redeemed by the
Company prior to April 2, 2002. Thereafter, the Convertible Subordinated Notes
are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or part, at the redemption
prices set forth in the Convertible Subordinated Notes indenture. As of December
31, 1999, the Company had no material indebtedness outstanding that would have
constituted Senior Indebtedness. The Indenture does not limit the amount of
additional indebtedness, including Senior Indebtedness, which the Company can
create, incur, assume, or guarantee, nor does the Indenture limit the amount of
indebtedness which any subsidiary of the Company can create, incur, assume or
guarantee.
In August 1999, the Company repurchased $60,000 of its Convertible
Subordinated Notes for approximately $36,400, and as a result, the Company
recognized an extraordinary gain of $21,800, net of amortized debt issuance
costs. In October 1999, the Company repurchased $70,300 of its Convertible
Subordinated Notes for approximately $53,700, and as a result, the Company

unamortized debt issuance costs. Convertible Subordinated Notes in an aggregate
principal amount of approximately $20,000 remain outstanding as of December 31,
1999.
In July 1997, the Company entered into a $2,500 equipment line of
credit with a leasing company. The equipment line carries interest at the rate

convertible preferred stock converted into common stock at the ratio of 04
shares of common stock for each share of preferred stock. All then existing
classes of preferred stock ceased to be authorized, and were replaced by the
preferred stock discussed below.
On April 14, 1997, the Board of Directors authorized the filing of an
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation which became effective upon
the completion of the IPO. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of
up to an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series
and to fix or alter the designations, preferences, rights and any
qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the shares of each such series
thereof, including the dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms
of redemption including sinking fund provisions, redemption price or
prices,liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any series
or designations of such series. The Company has no present plans to issue any
shares of preferred stock.
In March 1997, the Company entered into a five-year agreement with CBS
Inc. CBS. In consideration of the advertising and promotional efforts of CBS
and its license to the Company of the right to use certain CBS logos and
television-related sports content, CBS will receive 3,100,000 shares of common
stock over the term of the agreement 752,273, 735,802, 558,988, 567,579 and
485,358 shares in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. CBS will also
have the right to receive 60% of the Company advertising revenue on
cbs.sportsline.com pages related to certain signature events such as the NCAA
Men Basketball Tournament, the 1998 Winter Olympics, U.S. Open Tennis, PGA
Tour events and the Daytona 500 and 50% of the Company advertising revenue on
other cbs.sportsline.com pages containing CBS television-related sports content.
The CBS agreement also provides that the Company shall issue to CBS on the first
business day of each contract year warrants to purchase 380,000 shares of common
stock at per share exercise prices ranging from $10 in 1997 to $30 in 2001. Such
warrants are exercisable at any time during the contract year in which they are
granted. The value of the advertising and content will be recorded annually in
the consolidated balance sheets as deferred advertising and content costs and
amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over each related contract
year. Amounts amortized to expense in 1999, 1998 and 1997 totaled $14,096 12,002 and $7,835, respectively, consisting of amortization relating to
advertising of $11,000 for both 1999 and 1998 and $7,000 relating to 1997,

related to warrants of $2,578, $484 and $404, respectively, and are included in
depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997.
In February 1999, the Company amended and extended its agreement with
CBS. In consideration of additional promotional and advertising opportunities
the Company agreed to accelerate the issuance of the remaining shares that were
formerly to be issued in 2000 and 2001 567,579 and 485,358 shares,
respectively, issued additional warrants to purchase 1,200,000 shares of common
stock at per share exercise prices ranging from $23 in 1999 to $45 in 2001 and
issue additional shares of common stock valued at $100 million between 2002 and
2006. Additionally, the revenue sharing provisions relating to the 60% share for
signature events and the 50% share for CBS content pages were eliminated and
replaced by a new revenue sharing formula which is calculated on a broader
revenue base and at a lower rate. Total annual amounts to be amortized to

Pro forma information is required by SFAS No. 123 and has been
determined as if the Company had accounted for its stock-based compensation
plans under the fair value method. The fair value of each option grant was
estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively: risk-free interest rates of 46% to 56%, 57% to 67% and
60% to 66%, dividend yield of 0% for all years, expected volatility factor of
100%, 65% and 40% and expected life of 439 years for all years.

On April 14, 1997, the Company adopted the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
the Purchase Plan under which 500,000 shares of common stock are reserved.
The Purchase Plan became effective upon completion of the IPO. The Purchase Plan
provides eligible employees, as defined therein, the right to purchase shares of
common stock. The purchase price per share will be equal to 85% of the fair
market value as of certain measurement dates. Such purchases are limited in any
calendar year to the lower of 25% of the employee total annual compensation or
$25,000. On November 19, 1999, the Purchase Plan was amended to increase the
number of shares reserved for issuance to 1,000,000. Shares of common stock
issued under the plan were 101,561 and 329,085 in 1999 and 1998, respectively.
In January 1996, the Company adopted a retirement plan that qualifies
under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code. Under this plan,
participating employees, as defined, may defer a portion of their pretax
earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limits. There
is currently no matching of employee contributions by the Company.
7 INCOME TAXES     No provision for Federal and state income taxes has been recorded as
the Company has incurred net operating losses through December 31, 1999. At
December 31, 1999, the Company had approximately $97,000 of net operating loss
carryforwards for Federal income tax reporting purposes available to offset
future taxable income; such carryforwards expire beginning in 2009. Under the
Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of and benefits from net operating losses
carried forward may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances. Events
which may cause limitations in the amount of net operating losses that the
Company may utilize in any one year include, but are not limited to, a
cumulative ownership change of more than 50% over a three year period.
Deferred tax assets at December 31, 1999 and 1998 consist primarily of
the tax effect of net operating loss carryforwards which amounted to
approximately $97,000 and $33,000, respectively. Other deferred tax assets and
liabilities are not significant. The Company has provided a full 100% valuation
allowance on the deferred tax assets at December 31, 1999 and 1998 to reduce
such deferred income tax assets to zero as it is management belief that
realization of such amounts do not meet the criteria required by generally
accepted accounting principles. Management will review the valuation allowance
requirement periodically and make adjustments as warranted.
