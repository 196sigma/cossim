ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA  
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  The Board of Directors and Stockholders ONEOK, Inc.:  We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting, that ONEOK, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSO. ONEOK, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.  In our opinion, managements assessment
that ONEOK, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Also, in our opinion, ONEOK, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of ONEOK, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004, and our
report dated March 7, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.  KPMG LLP

58 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders ONEOK, Inc.:  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ONEOK, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity and
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ONEOK, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  As discussed in Notes A and F to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, the recognition and measurement principles of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, and the rescission of the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force 98-10, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities, effective January 1, 2003, and the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective January 1, 2002.  We also audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of ONEOK, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  A
SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Nature of Operations - We are a
diversified energy company. We purchase, gather, process, transport, store, and distribute natural gas. We drill for and produce natural gas and oil; extract, fractionate, store, transport, sell and market natural gas liquids NGLs; and are engaged
in natural gas, crude oil, NGLs and electricity marketing, retail marketing and trading activities. We are the largest natural gas distributor in Oklahoma and Kansas and the third largest gas distributor in Texas, providing service as a regulated
public utility to wholesale and retail customers. Our largest markets are Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma; Kansas City, Wichita, and Topeka, Kansas; and Austin and El Paso, Texas. Our energy services operations provide services to customers in
many states. We acquired Northern Plains Natural Gas Company and its wholly owned subsidiary Pan Border Gas Company collectively, Northern Plains in November 2004. As a result of this acquisition we are the majority general partner of Northern
Border Partners, one of the largest publicly-traded limited partnerships. Northern Border Partners acquires, owns and manages pipelines and other midstream energy assets and is a leading transporter of natural gas imported from Canada into the
United States.  Critical Accounting Policies  The following is a summary of our most critical accounting policies, which are defined as
those policies most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requiring managements most difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, particularly because of the need to make estimates concerning the
impact of inherently uncertain matters. We have discussed the development of and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our Board of Directors.  Derivatives and Risk Management Activities - We engage in wholesale energy marketing,
retail marketing, trading, and risk management activities. We account for derivative instruments utilized in connection with these activities and services under the fair value basis of accounting in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Statement 133, as amended. Many of our purchase and sale agreements that otherwise would be required to
follow derivative accounting qualify as normal purchases and normal sales under Statement 133 and are therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment.  Under Statement 133, entities are required to record derivative instruments at fair value. The fair value of derivative instruments is determined by commodity exchange
prices, over-the-counter quotes, volatility, time value, counterparty credit and the potential impact on market prices of liquidating positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market conditions. The majority of
our portfolios fair values are based on actual market prices. Market value changes result in a change in the fair value of our derivative instruments. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether
it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the reason for holding it. If the derivative instrument does not qualify or is not designated as part of a hedging relationship, we account for changes in fair value
of the derivative in earnings as they occur. Commodity price volatility may have a significant impact on the gain or loss in any given period.  To minimize the risk of fluctuations in natural gas, NGLs and crude oil prices, we periodically enter into futures transactions and swaps in order to hedge anticipated
sales and purchases of natural gas and crude oil production, fuel requirements and NGL inventories. Interest rate swaps are also used to manage interest rate risk. Under certain conditions, we designate these derivative instruments as a hedge of
exposure to changes in fair values or cash flows. For hedges of exposure to changes in fair value, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the
hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. For hedges of exposure to changes in cash flow, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income and is
subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Any ineffectiveness of designated hedges is reported in earnings.  Energy-related contracts that are not derivatives pursuant to Statement 133 are no longer carried at fair value, but are accounted for on an accrual basis as executory
contracts. Changes to the accounting for existing contracts as a result of the rescission of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98-10, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities EITF 98-10 were
reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on January 1, 2003. This resulted in a cumulative effect loss, net of tax, of $1418 million. 
70 Table of Contents See Note D for more discussion of derivatives and risk management activities.  Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets - We assess our goodwill for
impairment at least annually based on Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Statement 142. An initial assessment is made by comparing the fair value of the operations with goodwill,
as determined in accordance with Statement 142, to the book value. If the fair value is less than the book value, an impairment is indicated and we must perform a second test to measure the amount of the impairment. In the second test, we calculate
the implied fair value of the goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the operations with goodwill from the fair value determined in step one of the assessment. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds
this calculated implied fair value of the goodwill, we will record an impairment charge. See Note F for more discussion of goodwill.  We assess our long-lived assets for impairment based on Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets Statement 144. A long-lived asset is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may exceed its fair value. Fair values are based on the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows
expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets.  Examples of long-lived asset impairment indicators include:  a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group,  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition,  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset or asset group, including an adverse action or assessment
by a regulator that would exclude allowable costs from the rate-making process,  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset or asset group,
a current-period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of operating cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the
use of a long-lived asset or asset group, and  a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated
useful life.  Pension and Postretirement Employee Benefits
- - We have a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all full-time employees and a postretirement employee benefits plan covering most employees. Nonbargaining unit employees hired after December 31, 2004 are not eligible for our defined
benefit pension plan; however, they are covered by a profit sharing plan. Our actuarial consultant calculates the expense and liability related to these plans and uses statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events. These
factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, age and employment periods. In determining the projected benefit obligations and the costs, assumptions can change from
period to period and result in material changes in the costs and liabilities we recognize. See Note K for more discussion of pension and postretirement employee benefits.  Contingencies - Our accounting for contingencies covers a variety of business activities including contingencies for legal exposures
and environmental exposures. We accrue these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered and an amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We base our estimates on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution. Actual results may differ from our estimates resulting in
an impact, either positive or negative, on earnings. See Note L for more discussion of contingencies.  Significant Accounting Policies  Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ONEOK, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in
20 percent to 50 percent-owned affiliates are accounted for on the equity method. Investments in less than 20 percent owned affiliates are accounted for on the cost method unless we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating
and financial policies of our investee, in which case we apply the equity method. Our investment in the general and limited partner interests in Northern Border Partners is accounted for by the equity method. 
71 Table of Contents The EITF is currently deliberating EITF Issue No. 04-5, Investors Accounting for an Investment in a Limited
Partnership When the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights EITF 04-5. Since the changes proposed in EITF 04-5 would result in different guidance in accounting for general partners that are in
different industries, the FASB Staff is planning to amend SOP 78-9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures to be consistent with EITF 04-5. SOP 78-9-a, Interaction of AICPA Statement of Position 78-9, Accounting for
Investments in Real Estate Ventures, and EITF Issue No. 04-5, Investors Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership When the Investor Is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights SOP
78-9-a will have the presumption that a general partner controls a limited partnership and therefore should consolidate the partnership. This presumption can be overcome if the limited partners have kick-out or substantive participating rights. We
could be required to consolidate Northern Border Partners; however we will begin to evaluate the impact and transition method if or when SOP 78-9-a and EITF 04-5 are finalized. The anticipated effective date of SOP 78-9-a and EITF 04-5 is January 1,
2006.  Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash equivalents consist of highly
liquid investments, which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less.  Inventories - Materials and supplies are valued at average cost. Noncurrent gas in storage is classified as property and is valued at cost. Cost of current gas in
storage for Oklahoma Natural Gas is determined under the last-in, first-out LIFO methodology. The estimated replacement cost of current gas in storage was $373 million and $283 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, compared to its
value under the LIFO method of $389 million and $326 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Current natural gas and NGLs in storage for all other companies are determined using the weighted average cost of gas method.  Regulated Property - Regulated properties are stated at cost, which includes an
allowance for funds used during construction. The allowance for funds used during construction represents the capitalization of the estimated average cost of borrowed funds 62 percent in 2004 and 64 percent in 2003 used during the construction
of major projects and is recorded as a credit to interest expense.  Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on rates prescribed for ratemaking purposes. The average depreciation rates for Oklahoma Natural Gas and ONEOK Gas Transportation property regulated by the Oklahoma Corporation
Commission OCC, Kansas Gas Service and Mid Continent Market Center property regulated by the Kansas Corporation Commission KCC, and Texas Gas Service and ONEOK WesTex Transmission property regulated by the Texas Railroad Commission RRC and
various municipalities in Texas is set forth in the following table for the periods indicated.  YearsEndedDecember31 Regulated Property

- We acquired Texas Gas Service in January 2003.  Maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense. Generally, the cost of property retired or sold, plus removal costs, less salvage, is charged to accumulated
depreciation. Gains and losses from sales or transfers of operating units or systems are recognized in income.  The following table sets forth the remaining life and service years of our regulated properties.  RemainingLife

72 Table of Contents Production Property - We use the successful-efforts method to account for costs incurred in the acquisition and
development of natural gas and oil reserves. Costs to acquire mineral interests in proved reserves and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized. Geological and geophysical costs and costs to drill exploratory wells which do not find
proved reserves are expensed. Unproved oil and gas properties, which are individually significant, are periodically assessed for impairment. The remaining unproved oil and gas properties are aggregated and amortized based upon remaining lease terms
and exploratory and developmental drilling experience. Depreciation and depletion are calculated using the unit-of-production method based upon periodic estimates of proved gas and oil reserves.  Other Property - Gas processing plants and all other properties are stated at cost.
Gas processing plants are depreciated using various rates based on estimated lives of available gas reserves. All other property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life.  Environmental Expenditures - We accrue for losses associated with environmental
remediation obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study. Such
accruals are adjusted as further information becomes available or circumstances change. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.  Revenue Recognition - Revenues from the Production segment are recognized on the sales
method when gas and oil production volumes are delivered to the purchaser.  Our
remaining segments recognize revenue when services are rendered or product is delivered. Major industrial and commercial gas distribution customers are invoiced as of the end of each month. Certain gas distribution customers, primarily residential
and some commercial are invoiced on a cycle basis throughout the month, and we accrue unbilled revenues at the end of each month. Tariff rates for residential and commercial Oklahoma Natural Gas, Kansas Gas Service and some Texas Gas Service
customers contain a temperature normalization clause that provides for billing adjustments from actual volumes to normalized volumes during the winter heating season. A flat monthly service fee is included in the authorized rate design for Texas Gas
Service in El Paso and Port Arthur to protect customers from abnormal weather.  Income Taxes - Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is deferred and amortized for operations regulated by the OCC, KCC, RRC and various municipalities in Texas. For all other operations the
effect is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We continue to amortize previously deferred investment tax credits for ratemaking purposes over the period prescribed by the OCC, KCC, RRC and various municipalities in
Texas.  Regulation - Our intrastate transmission pipelines and
distribution operations are subject to the rate regulation and accounting requirements of the OCC, KCC, RRC and various municipalities in Texas. Other transportation activities are subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
FERC. Oklahoma Natural Gas, Kansas Gas Service, Texas Gas Service and portions of the Transportation and Storage segment follow the accounting and reporting guidance contained in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting
for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation Statement 71. During the rate-making process, regulatory authorities may require us to defer recognition of certain costs to be recovered through rates over time as opposed to expensing such
costs as incurred. This allows us to stabilize rates over time rather than passing such costs on to the customer for immediate recovery. Accordingly, actions of the regulatory authorities could have an affect on the amount recovered from rate
payers. Any difference in the amount recoverable and the amount deferred would be recorded as income or expense at the time of the regulatory action. If all or a portion of the regulated operations becomes no longer subject to the provisions of
Statement 71, a write-off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. See Note E for more discussion of our regulatory assets.  Asset Retirement Obligations - On January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations Statement 143. Statement 143 applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the asset.  Statement 143 requires that we recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation in the period when it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is
depreciated over the life of the asset. The liability is accreted at 
73 Table of Contents the end of each period through charges to operating expense. If the obligation is settled for an amount other than the
carrying amount of the liability, we will recognize a gain or loss on settlement.  All legal obligations for asset retirement obligations were identified and the fair value of these obligations was determined as of January 1, 2003. The obligations primarily relate to the 300-megawatt power plant and various processing
plants, storage facilities and producing wells. As a result of the adoption of Statement 143, we recorded a long-term liability of approximately $163 million, an increase to property, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, of
approximately $129 million, and a cumulative effect loss of approximately $21 million, net of tax, in the first quarter of 2003. The related depreciation and amortization expense is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. 
In accordance with long-standing regulatory treatment, we collect through rates the
estimated costs of removal on certain regulated properties through depreciation expense, with a corresponding credit to accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization. These removal costs are non-legal obligations as defined by Statement 143.
However, these non-legal asset removal obligations should be accounted for as a regulatory liability under Statement 71. Historically, the regulatory authorities which have jurisdiction over our regulated operations have not required us to track
this amount; rather these costs are addressed prospectively as depreciation rates are set in each general rate order. We have made an estimate of our removal cost liability using current rates since the last general rate order in each of our
jurisdictions. However, significant uncertainty exists regarding the ultimate determination of this liability pending, among other issues, clarification of regulatory intent. Further study is ongoing, and the liability may be adjusted as more
information is obtained. We have reclassified the estimated non-legal asset removal obligation from accumulated deprecation, depletion and amortization to non-current liabilities in other deferred credits on our balance sheets as of December 31,
2004 and 2003. To the extent this estimated liability is adjusted, such amounts will be reclassified between accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization and other deferred credits and thus will not have an impact on earnings.  Common Stock Options and Awards - On January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure Statement 148. Statement 148 was an amendment to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation Statement 123. We elected to begin expensing the fair value of all stock option compensation granted on or after January 1, 2003 under the prospective method allowed by Statement 148. Prior to January 1, 2003, we
accounted for our stock option compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, and related interpretations. The following table sets forth the effect
on net income and earnings per common share EPS as if we had applied the fair-value recognition provisions of Statement 123 to stock-based employee compensation in the periods presented.  Years Ended December 31 2004

In December 2004, the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment Statement 123R. Statement 123R requires companies to expense the fair value of share-based payments. In addition, there are also changes related to the
share-based payment expense calculation. Statement 123R is effective for the interim period 
74 Table of Contents beginning after June 15, 2005. We are currently assessing the impact of adopting Statement 123R, but we do not believe it
will have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as we have been expensing share-based payments since the adoption of Statement 148 on January 1, 2003.  Earnings per Common Share - Basic earnings per share of common stock are calculated based on the daily weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share of common stock are calculated based on the daily weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period plus potentially dilutive components.
The dilutive components are calculated based on the dilutive effect for each quarter. For any fiscal year period consisting of two or more quarters, the dilutive components for each quarter are averaged to arrive at the fiscal year to date dilutive
component.  Labor Force - We employed 4,657 people at December 31, 2004.
Approximately 18 percent of the workforce, all of whom are employed by Kansas Gas Service, is covered by collective bargaining agreements with 8 percent covered by agreements that expire in 2006 and 10 percent covered by agreements that expire in
2009.  Use of Estimates - Certain amounts included in or affecting our
financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated, requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared. Items which may be
estimated include, but are not limited to, the economic useful life of assets, gas and oil reserves, fair value of assets and liabilities, obligations under employee benefit plans, provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable, unbilled revenues
for gas delivered but for which meters have not been read, gas purchased expense for gas received but for which no invoice has been received, provision for income taxes including any deferred tax valuation allowances, the results of litigation and
various other recorded or disclosed amounts. Accordingly, the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures are necessarily affected by these estimates.  We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis using historical experience, consultation
with experts and other methods we consider reasonable based on the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from the estimates. Any effects on our financial position or results of operations from revisions to
these estimates are recorded in the period when the facts that give rise to the revision become known.  Reclassifications - Certain amounts in prior period consolidated financial statements, primarily related to current and noncurrent deferred taxes and assets and liabilities from energy marketing and risk
management activities, have been reclassified to conform to the 2004 presentation. These reclassifications did not impact previously reported net income or shareholders equity.

75 Table of Contents B ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES  In November 2004, we acquired Northern Plains, which owns 825 percent of the general partnership interest and 500,000 limited partnership
units, together representing a 273 percent ownership interest, in Northern Border Partners, from CCE Holdings, LLC for $175 million. Income derived from this investment is included in other income in our Other segment.  In March 2004, we sold certain natural gas transmission and gathering pipelines and
compression facilities for approximately $13 million and recorded a pre-tax gain of $69 million, which is included in other income in the Transportation and Storage segment.  Additionally in 2004, we sold our gas distribution systems in Eagle Pass, Texas and Mexico and our propane operations in separate
transactions. We received a combined $74 million and recognized a net pre-tax gain of approximately $35 million.  In December 2003, we acquired approximately $240 million of Texas gas and oil properties and related flow lines from a partnership owned by Wagner Brown, Ltd. of
Midland, Texas. The results of operations for these assets have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date. The acquisition included approximately 318 wells, 271 of which we operate, and 1772 Bcfe of estimated proved gas
and oil reserves as of the September 1, 2003 effective date, with additional probable and possible gas reserve potential. Net production from these properties is approximately 26,000 Mcfe per day.  In December 2003, we acquired NGL storage and pipeline facilities located in Conway, Kansas
for approximately $137 million from ChevronTexaco. In the prior two years, we had leased and operated these facilities.  In October 2003, we sold certain Texas transmission assets for approximately $31 million. We recorded a charge against accumulated depreciation of approximately $78
million in accordance with Statement 71 and the regulatory accounting requirements of the FERC and RRC.  In January 2003, we sold approximately 70 percent of the natural gas and oil producing properties of our Production segment for a cash sales price of $294 million, including adjustments. See Note C.  In January 2003, we acquired the Texas gas distribution business and other assets from
Southern Union Company Southern Union. The results of operations for these assets have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date. We paid approximately $4366 million for these assets, including $166 million in
working capital adjustments. The primary assets acquired were gas distribution operations that currently serve approximately 557,000 customers in cities located throughout Texas, including the major cities of El Paso and Austin, as well as the
cities of Port Arthur, Galveston, Brownsville and others. Over 90 percent of the customers are residential. The other assets acquired include a 125-mile natural gas transmission system, as well as other energy related domestic assets involved in gas
marketing, retail sales of propane and distribution of propane. The purchase also includes natural gas distribution investments in Mexico. The assets relating to the propane distribution operations were sold in May and July 2004 and the natural gas
distribution investments in Mexico were sold in May 2004. Texas Gas Service operated these assets.  Additionally in 2003, we acquired, in separate transactions, the gas distribution system at the United States Armys Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas and a pipeline system that extends through the Rio Grande Valley
region in Texas for approximately $60 million.  The unaudited pro forma
information in the following table presents a summary of our consolidated results of operations as if the acquisition of the Texas assets from Southern Union had occurred at the beginning of the period presented. The results do not necessarily
reflect the results that would have been obtained if the acquisition had actually occurred on the dates indicated or results that may be expected in the future. The December 2003 acquisition from Wagner Brown, Ltd. is not included in the pro
forma information in the table below since this information is not available and we believe the amount is immaterial.

The addition of the Texas gas
distribution assets fits well with our concentration in the mid-continent region of the United States by adding to our distribution systems in Oklahoma and Kansas. The acquisition also adds a stable revenue source as a majority of the margins are
protected from the impact of weather swings due to rate designs that include a fixed customer charge. The regulatory environment in which municipalities set rates diversifies regulatory risk.  In December 2002, we sold of a portion of our midstream natural gas assets for a cash sales
price of approximately $92 million to an affiliate of Mustang Fuel Corporation, a private, independent oil and gas company. We recorded a loss of approximately $37 million in 2002 related to this sale. The assets that were sold are located in north
central Oklahoma and include three natural gas processing plants and related gathering systems and interest in a fourth natural gas processing plant.  In June 2002, we sold our remaining shares of Magnum Hunter Resources MHR common stock for a pre-tax gain of approximately $76 million, which is included in other
income. We retained approximately 15 million stock purchase warrants with an exercise price of $15 per share, which we exchanged for 15 million shares of MHR common stock in February 2005.  C DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  In January 2003, we sold approximately 70 percent of the natural gas and oil producing
properties of our Production segment the component for an adjusted cash price of $294 million. The component is accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with Statement 144. Accordingly, amounts in our financial statements and
related notes for all periods shown are reflected as discontinued operations. Our decision to sell the component was based on strategic evaluations of the Production segments goals and favorable market conditions. The properties sold were in
Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. We recognized a pretax gain on the sale of the discontinued component of approximately $612 million in 2003. The gain reflects the cash received less adjustments, selling expenses and the net book value of the assets
sold.  The amounts of revenue, costs and income taxes reported in discontinued
operations are as follows.  Years Ended December 31 2004

77 Table of Contents D ENERGY MARKETING AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  Risk Policy and Oversight - Market risks are monitored by a risk control group that
operates independently from the operating segments that create or actively manage these risk exposures. The risk control group ensures compliance with our risk management policies.  We control the scope of risk management, marketing and trading operations through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures involving
senior levels of management. The audit committee of our Board of Directors has oversight responsibilities for our risk management limits and policies. Our risk oversight committee, comprised of corporate and business segment officers, oversees all
activities related to commodity price, credit and interest rate risk management, marketing and trading activities. The committee also proposes risk metrics including value-at-risk VAR and position loss limits. We have a corporate risk control
organization led by the Senior Vice President of Financial Services and Treasurer and the Vice President of Audit and Risk Control, who are assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies, procedures and limits. Key risk control
activities include credit review and approval, credit and performance risk measurement and monitoring, validation of transactions, portfolio valuation, VAR and other risk metrics.  To the extent open commodity positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can impact our financial results and financial position, either
favorably or unfavorably. As a result, we cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business, operating results or financial position.  Accounting Treatment - We account for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accordance with Statement 133. Under Statement
133, entities are required to record all derivative instruments at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if
so, the reason for holding it. If the derivative instrument does not qualify or is not designated as part of a hedging relationship, we account for changes in fair value of the derivative instrument in earnings as they occur. We record these changes
in fair value as energy trading revenues, net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. If certain conditions are met, entities may elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge of exposure to changes in fair values, cash flows or foreign
currencies. For hedges of exposure to changes in fair value, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being
hedged. The difference between the change in fair value of the derivative instrument and the change in fair value of the hedged item represents hedge ineffectiveness. For hedges of exposure to changes in cash flow, the effective portion of the gain
or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Any amounts excluded from the assessment of
hedge effectiveness, as well as the ineffective portion of the hedge, are reported in earnings.  As required by Statement 133, we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions and
methods for assessing and testing correlation and hedge ineffectiveness. We specifically identify the asset, liability, firm commitment or forecasted transaction that has been designated as the hedged item. We assess the effectiveness of hedging
relationships, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis.  In
July 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03-11, Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133 and Not Held for Trading Purposes as Defined in EITF Issue
No. 02-3 EITF 03-11. EITF 03-11 provides that the determination of whether realized gains and losses on physically settled derivative contracts not held for trading purposes should be reported in the income statement on a gross
or net basis is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances. Consideration of the facts and circumstances should be made in the context of the various activities of the entity rather than based solely on the terms of
the individual contracts.  At the beginning of the third quarter of 2004, we
completed a reorganization of our Energy Services segment and renewed our focus on our physical marketing and storage business. We separated the management and operations of our wholesale marketing, retail marketing and trading activities and began
accounting separately for the different types of revenue earned from these activities. Prior to the third quarter, we managed the Energy Services segment on an integrated basis and presented all energy trading activity on a net basis. 
78 Table of Contents Concurrent with this reorganization, we evaluated the accounting treatment related to the presentation of revenues from
the different types of activities to determine which amounts should be reported on a gross or net basis under the guidance in EITF 03-11. For derivative instruments considered held for trading purposes that result in physical delivery, the
indicators in EITF Issue No. 02-3, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities were used to determine the proper treatment.
These activities and all financially settled derivative contracts will continue to be reported on a net basis.  For derivative instruments that are not considered held for trading purposes and that result in physical delivery, the indicators in EITF 03-11 and EITF Issue No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a
Principal versus Net as an Agent EITF 99-19 were used to determine the proper treatment. We began accounting for the realized revenues and purchase costs of these contracts that result in physical delivery on a gross basis beginning with the
third quarter of 2004. We apply the indicators in EITF 99-19 to determine the appropriate accounting treatment for non-derivative contracts that result in physical delivery. Derivatives that qualify for the normal purchase or sale exception as
defined in Statement 133 are also reported on a gross basis. No prior periods have been adjusted for this change; therefore, comparisons to prior periods may not be meaningful. Reporting of these transactions on a gross basis did not impact
operating income but resulted in an increase to revenues and cost of sales and fuel.  In 2002 we accounted for energy marketing and risk management activities for our energy trading contracts in accordance with EITF 98-10. EITF 98-10 required entities involved in energy trading activities to account for energy trading
contracts using mark-to-market accounting. Forwards, swaps, options, and energy transportation and storage contracts utilized for trading activities were reflected at fair value as assets and liabilities from energy marketing and risk management
activities in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value were recognized as energy trading revenues, net, in the consolidated statements of income.  In October 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF of the FASB rescinded EITF 98-10. As a result, energy-related contracts that are not
accounted for pursuant to Statement 133 are no longer carried at fair value, but rather will be accounted for on an accrual basis as executory contracts. As a result of the rescission of EITF 98-10, the Task Force also agreed that energy trading
inventories carried under storage agreements should no longer be carried at fair value, but should be carried at the lower of cost or market. The rescission was effective for all fiscal periods beginning after December 31, 2002 and for all existing
energy trading contracts and inventory as of October 25, 2002. Additionally, the rescission applied immediately to contracts entered into on or after October 25, 2002. Changes to the accounting for existing contracts as a result of the rescission of
EITF 98-10 were reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on January 1, 2003. This resulted in a cumulative effect loss, net of tax, of $1418 million. The impact from this change was non-cash.  Energy Marketing and Risk Management Activities - Our operating results are impacted
by commodity price fluctuations. We routinely enter into derivative financial instruments to minimize the risk of commodity price fluctuations related to anticipated sales of natural gas and crude oil production, purchase and sale commitments, fuel
requirements, transportation and storage contracts, and natural gas and NGL inventories. We are also subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. We manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt,
floating rate debt and, at times, interest rate swaps.  The Energy Services
segment includes our wholesale and retail natural gas marketing and storage, retail and financial trading operations. The Energy Services segment generally attempts to manage the commodity risk of its fixed-price physical purchase and sale
commitments in terms of contract volumes and the timing of performance and delivery obligations through the use of derivative instruments. With respect to the net open positions that exist within our financial trading operations, fluctuating
commodity market prices can impact our financial position and results of operations, either favorably or unfavorably. The net open positions are actively managed and the impact of the changing prices on our financial condition at a point in time is
not necessarily indicative of the impact of price movements throughout the year.  Operating margins associated with the Gathering and Processing segments natural gas gathering, processing and fractionation activities are sensitive to changes in natural gas, condensate and NGL prices, principally as a result of
contractual terms under which natural gas is processed and products are sold. We use physical forward sales and derivative instruments to secure a certain price for natural gas, condensate and NGL products. Our Production segment utilizes derivative
instruments in order to hedge anticipated sales of natural gas and oil production. Our Distribution segment uses derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our natural gas purchases. 
79 Table of Contents Fair Value Hedges - During the first quarter of 2004, we terminated $670 million of our interest rate swap
agreements to lock in savings and received $918 million, which includes $89 million of interest rate savings previously recorded. These interest rate swaps were previously initiated as a strategy to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate, long-term
debt. The net proceeds received upon termination of the interest rate swaps were $819 million, after reduction for ineffectiveness and unpaid interest. Ineffectiveness related to these hedges of approximately $10 million is included in interest
expense. Through December 31, 2004, $81 million in interest expense savings has been recognized and the remaining amount of $738 million will be recognized in the income statement over the remaining term of the debt instruments originally hedged.
Consequently, the remaining savings in interest expense will be recognized over the following periods:  2005 100million
2006 100 million
2007 100 million
2008 100 million
Thereafter 338 million
In the first quarter of 2004, we
entered into new swap agreements to replace the terminated agreements. Currently, $740 million of fixed rate debt is swapped to floating. The floating rate debt is based on both the three and six-month London InterBank Offered Rate LIBOR,
depending upon the swap. At December 31, 2004, we had a net liability of $176 million to reflect the fair value of the current interest rate swaps. Long-term debt reflects the offset to the fair value of the swaps with a decrease in overall debt of
$176 million. See Note J.  The Energy Services segment uses basis swaps to
hedge the fair value of certain firm transportation commitments. Net gains or losses from the fair value hedges are recorded to cost of sales and fuel. The ineffectiveness related to these hedges was not material in 2004, 2003 or 2002. 
Cash Flow Hedges - The Energy Services segment uses futures and basis swaps to
hedge the cash flows associated with its anticipated purchases and sales of natural gas and cost of fuel used in transportation of gas. Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2004, includes net losses of approximately $53 million, net
of tax, related to these hedges that will be realized within the next 49 months, of which $87 million in net losses will be recognized in the next 12 months. The Production and Gathering and Processing segments periodically enter into derivative
instruments to hedge the cash flows associated with their exposure to changes in the price of natural gas and oil. Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2004, includes losses of approximately $25 million, net of tax, for the
production hedges and gains of approximately $22 million, net of tax, for the gathering and processing hedges, both of which will be realized in the income statement within the next 12 months.  Our regulated businesses also use derivative instruments from time to time. Gains or losses
associated with these derivative instruments are included in and recoverable through the monthly purchased gas adjustment. At December 31, 2004, Kansas Gas Service had derivative instruments in place to hedge the cost of natural gas purchases for
44 Bcf, which represents part of their gas purchase requirements for the 2005 winter heating months.  Net gains and losses are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss to operating revenues or cost of sales and fuel when the anticipated purchase or sale occurs. Ineffectiveness related to these cash
flow hedges was approximately $123 million, $77 million and $14 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Additionally, losses of approximately $46 million were recognized from accumulated other comprehensive loss in 2004, due to the
discontinuance of cash flow hedge treatment on certain transactions since it was probable that the forecasted transactions would not occur. There were no losses in 2003 or 2002 due to the discontinuance of cash flow hedge treatment.  Fair Value - The following table represents the fair value of our energy marketing and
risk management assets and liabilities for the periods indicated. Any income statement effect related to hedges in the Distribution segment will be recovered through the cost of gas. The fair value is the carrying value for these instruments at
December 31, 2004 and 2003.

average fair values during 2004 for financial trading and non-trading assets and liabilities was approximately $2927 million and $3243 million, respectively. For 2003, the amounts were $1361 million and $1948 million, respectively. 
Fair value estimates consider the market in which the transactions are executed. We
utilize third party references for pricing points from NYMEX and third party over-the-counter brokers to establish commodity pricing and volatility curves. We believe the reported transactions from these sources are the most reflective of current
market prices. Fair values are subject to change based on valuation factors. The estimate of fair value includes an adjustment for the liquidation of the position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market conditions.
The fair value estimate also considers the risk of nonperformance based on credit considerations of the counterparty.  Credit Risk - We maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe significantly minimize overall credit risk. These policies include an
evaluation of potential counterparties financial condition including credit ratings, collateral requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized agreements which allow for netting of positive and negative exposures
associated with a single counterparty.  Our counterparties consist primarily of
financial institutions, major energy companies and local distribution companies LDCs. This concentration of counterparties may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively in that the counterparties may be similarly
affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions. Based on our policies, exposures, credit and other reserves, we do not anticipate a material adverse effect on financial position or results of operations as a result of counterparty
nonperformance.  Financial Instruments  The following table represents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our
financial instruments, excluding energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities, which are listed in the table above.  Book Value

table presents a summary of regulatory assets, net of amortization, at December 31, 2004 and 2003.  December31, 2004
December31, 2003 Thousands of dollars
Recoupable take-or-pay 58,412 64,171
Pension costs 13,125 18,060
Postretirement costs other than pension 52,477 59,118
Transition costs 16,209 16,691
Reacquired debt costs 19,777 20,635
Deferred taxes 18,471 21,782

Ad valorem tax 5,659 Service lines 1,517 3,250
Other 7,964 9,133 Regulatory assets, net 203,547 213,915  At December 31, 2004, we were not
earning a return on $282 million of these regulatory assets. The remaining recovery period for these assets ranges from one to 33 years.  On January 30, 2004, the OCC approved Oklahoma Natural Gas request that it be allowed to recover costs that it has incurred since 2000 when it assumed
responsibility for its customers service lines and enhanced efforts to protect pipelines from corrosion. The order also allows Oklahoma Natural Gas to recover costs related to its investment in gas in storage and rising levels of fuel-related
bad debts. The OCCs order also approved a modified distribution main extension policy and authorized Oklahoma Natural Gas to defer expected homeland security costs. The order allows rate relief of $177 million annually, with $107 million as
interim and subject to refund until a final determination at the Companys next general rate case, which was filed on January 28, 2005. We believe that any refund obligation is remote and, accordingly, have not recorded a reserve. Approximately
$70 million annually is considered final and not subject to refund. With the approval of Oklahoma Natural Gas request, we began amortizing the deferred costs associated with these OCC directives over an 18 month period. At December 31, 2004,
we had approximately $28 million remaining to be amortized, compared to $60 million at December 31, 2003. These deferred costs are included in the captions Service lines and Other in the regulatory assets table above.
On September 17, 2003, the KCC issued an order approving a $45 million in rate
relief pursuant to a stipulated settlement agreement with Kansas Gas Service. The order primarily authorized the recovery of $264 million of deferred postretirement 
82 Table of Contents and postemployment benefit costs over nine years. The order also made the weather normalization adjustment rider, which
had been renewed annually, a permanent component of customer rates.  Weather normalization represents the revenue over- or under-recovered through the weather normalization adjustment program in Kansas. This amount is deferred as a regulatory asset for a twelve-month period. Kansas Gas Service
then applies an adjustment to the customers bills for twelve months to refund the over-collected revenue or bill the under-collected revenue.  The OCC has authorized Oklahoma Natural Gas recovery of the take-or-pay settlement, pension and postretirement benefit costs over a 10 to 20 year period.
We amortize reacquired debt costs in accordance with the accounting rules
prescribed by the OCC and KCC. These costs were included as a component of interest in the most recent rate filing with the OCC and were included in the rate order issued by the KCC on September 17, 2003.  The $57 million Ad valorem tax represents an increase in Kansas Gas
Services taxes above the amount approved in the September 2003 rate case. Kansas law permits a utility to file a tariff to recover additional ad valorem tax expense incurred above the amount currently recovered in the cost of service rate.
This excess amount is recoverable through a surcharge and can be recovered, provided the utility reports the change in rates to the KCC, on an annual basis. Kansas Gas Service filed the tariff and received approval from the KCC during the third
quarter of 2004.  Recovery through rates resulted in amortization of regulatory
assets of approximately $166 million, $118 million and $119 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  F GOODWILL  We adopted Statement 142 on January 1, 2002. Under Statement 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain indicators arise. Statement 142 prescribes a
two-phase process for testing the impairment of goodwill. The first phase identifies indicators of impairment. If impairment is indicated, the second phase measures the impairment. We performed our annual test of goodwill as of January 1, 2004 and
there was no impairment indicated.  The changes in the carrying amount of
goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows.  Balance December31,2002

resulted from the sale of the gas distribution system in Eagle Pass, Texas by the Distribution segment in December 2004 and from the sale of certain natural gas transmission and gathering pipelines and compression facilities by the Transportation
and Storage segment in March 2004. The 2003 adjustments to goodwill resulted from the preliminary purchase price allocation of our Texas assets acquired in January 2003.

H CAPITAL STOCK  Series A Convertible Preferred Stock - We issued Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Series A, par value $001 per share, at the time of the November 1997 transaction with Westar Energy, Inc. formerly
Western Resources, Inc. On February 5, 2003, we repurchased from Westar Industries, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Westar Energy collectively Westar, approximately 9 million shares approximately 181 million shares of common stock
equivalents of our Series A. We exchanged the remaining shares for 218 million shares of our newly-created Series D Convertible Preferred Stock Series D. See further discussion in the Westar section of this Note. There are no shares of Series A
currently outstanding.  Series B Convertible Preferred Stock - There are
no shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock currently outstanding.  Series C Preferred Stock - Series C Preferred Stock Series C is designed to protect our shareholders from coercive or unfair takeover tactics. Holders of Series C are entitled to receive, in preference to the holders of ONEOK, Inc.
Common Stock, quarterly dividends in an amount per share equal to the greater of $050 or subject to adjustment, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount payable in kind of all
non-cash dividends. No Series C has been issued.  Series D Convertible
Preferred Stock - In February 2003, we exchanged the remaining shares of Series A for 218 million shares of Series D. During 2003, Westar sold all its equity in us, including all of the shares of our common stock and our Series D, which
converted to common stock when sold. See further discussion in the Westar section of this Note. The Series D were retired after Westars sale.  Common Stock - At December 31, 2004, we had approximately 179 million shares of authorized and unreserved common stock available for issuance.  Since September 17, 2004, the Thrift Plan for Employees of ONEOK, Inc. and subsidiaries the
Thrift Plan has from time to time purchased shares of our common stock on the open market to meet the purchase requirements generated by participants in the Thrift Plan. Previously, the Thrift Plan used newly issued shares to meet the
participants purchase requirements. All participant purchases of our common stock under the Thrift Plan are voluntary. We currently use newly issued shares to meet the purchase requirements generated by our Dividend Reinvestment Plan and the
Long-Term Incentive Plan.  The Board of Directors has reserved 120 million
shares of our common stock for the Direct Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan, of which 151,000 shares, 172,000 shares and 188,000 shares were issued in 2004, 2003 and 2002, 
84 Table of Contents respectively. We have reserved approximately 132 million shares for the Thrift Plan, less the number of shares issued to
date under this plan.  In January 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a
stock buy back program to repurchase up to 75 million shares of our common stock currently issued and outstanding. The shares will be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions at our
discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. The program will terminate after two years, unless extended by our Board of Directors.  2004 Common Stock Offering - During the first quarter of 2004, we sold 69 million shares of our common stock to an underwriter at $2193 per share, resulting in
proceeds to us, before expenses, of $1513 million.  2003 Public
Offerings - During the first quarter of 2003, we conducted public offerings of our common stock and equity units. In connection with these offerings, we issued a total of 138 million shares of our common stock at the public offering price of
$1719 per share, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us, after underwriting discounts and commissions, of $16524 per share, or $228 million.  In addition, we issued a total of 161 million equity units at the public offering price of $25 per unit, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us, after underwriting
discounts and commissions, of $2425 per equity unit, or $3904 million. Each equity unit consists of a stock purchase contract for the purchase of our common stock and, initially, a senior note described in Note J. The number of shares that we will
issue for each stock purchase contract issued as part of the equity units will be determined based on our average closing price over the 20-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to February 16, 2006. If this average closing price:
equals or exceeds $2063, we will issue 12119 shares of our common stock for each purchase contract,  equals or is less than $1719, we will issue 14543 shares of our common stock for each purchase contract, or  is less than $2063 but greater than $1719, we will determine the number of shares of our common stock to be issued by multiplying the number of purchase contracts by the ratio of
$25 divided by the average closing price.  Westar - On
January 9, 2003, we entered into an agreement with Westar to repurchase a portion of the shares of our Series A held by Westar and to exchange Westars remaining shares of Series A for newly-created shares of our $0925 Series D. The Series A
were convertible into two shares of common stock for each share of Series A, reflecting our two-for-one stock split in 2001, and the Series D were convertible into one share of common stock for each share of Series D. Some of the differences between
the Series D and the Series A were a the Series D had a fixed quarterly cash dividend of 23125 cents per share, b the Series D was redeemable by us at any time after August 1, 2006, at a per share redemption price of $20, in the event that the
per share closing price of our common stock exceeded, at any time prior to the date the notice of redemption was given, $25 for 30 consecutive trading days, c each share of Series D was convertible into one share of our common stock, and d with
certain exceptions, Westar could not convert any shares of Series D held by it unless the annual per share dividend on our common stock for the previous year was greater than 925 cents and such conversion would not have subjected us to the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.  In connection with that transaction, a
new rights agreement, a new shareholder agreement and a new registration rights agreement between us and Westar became effective. The shareholder agreement restricted Westar from selling five percent or more of our outstanding Series D and common
stock assuming conversion of all shares of Series D to be transferred, in a bona fide public underwritten offering, to any one person or group. The agreement allowed Westar to sell up to five percent of our outstanding Series D and common stock
assuming conversion of all shares of Series D to be transferred to any one person or group who did not own more than five percent of our outstanding common stock assuming conversion of all shares of Series D to be transferred.  The KCC approved our agreement with Westar on January 17, 2003. On February 5, 2003, we
consummated the agreement by purchasing $300 million of our Series A from Westar. We exchanged Westars remaining 109 million Series A for approximately 218 million shares of our newly-created Series D. Upon the cash redemption of the Series
A, the shares were converted to approximately 181 million shares of common stock in accordance with the terms of the Series A and the prior shareholder agreement with Westar. Accordingly, the redemption is reflected as an increase to common
treasury stock. The Series D exchanged for the Series A was recorded at fair value and the premium over the previous carrying value of the Series A is reflected as a decrease in retained earnings. We had registered for resale all of the shares of
our common stock held by Westar, as well as all the shares of our Series D issued to Westar and all of the shares of our common stock that were issuable upon conversion of the Series D. 
85 Table of Contents On August 5, 2003, Westar conducted a secondary offering to the public of 95 million shares of our common stock at a
public offering price of $1900 per share, which resulted in gross offering proceeds to Westar of approximately $1805 million. An over-allotment option for an additional 718,000 shares provided Westar with approximately $136 million. We did not
receive any proceeds from the offering. Since Westar received in excess of $150 million of total proceeds from the offering, we were allowed, under a new transaction agreement related to the offering, to repurchase $50 million, or approximately 26
million shares, of our common stock from Westar at the public offering price of $1900 per share. Our repurchase of those shares occurred immediately following the closing of the Westar offering. Of the shares sold in the Westar public offering,
approximately 84 million shares represented our common stock issued by conversion of our Series D owned by Westar. The remaining shares consisted of approximately 11 million shares of our common stock owned by Westar.  On November 21, 2003, Westar sold its remaining equity in us, which included all the shares
of common stock Westar owned and all of our Series D, which converted to shares of common stock when sold.  I LINES OF CREDIT AND SHORT-TERM NOTES PAYABLE  Commercial paper and short-term notes payable totaling $6440 million and $6000 million were outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The commercial paper and short-term notes payable carried average
interest rates of 177 percent and 124 percent at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We have a $10 billion five-year unsecured credit facility, which provides a back-up line of credit for commercial paper in addition to providing short-term
funds. The principal amount of the credit facility may be increased by $200 million if requested by us and the corresponding incremental commitments are received from new or existing lenders. The interest rate is a floating rate based at our
election on i either the higher of prime or one-half of one percent above the Federal Funds Overnight Rate, which is the rate that banks charge each other for the overnight borrowing of funds, or ii the Eurodollar rate plus a set number of basis
points based on our current long-term unsecured debt ratings by Moodys Investors Service and Standard and Poors Rating Services SP. The credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including covenants
relating to liens, investments, fundamental changes in our business, changes in the nature of our business, transactions with affiliates, the use of proceeds, a limit on our debt to capital ratio, a limit on investments in master limited
partnerships and a covenant that prevents us from restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to ONEOK, Inc. No amounts were outstanding under the line of credit and no compensating balance requirements existed at December 31, 2004.
We entered into an agreement with KBC Bank NV in April 2004. The agreement
gives us access to an uncommitted line of credit for loans and letters of credit up to a maximum principal amount of $10 million. The rate charged on any outstanding amount is the higher of prime or one-half of one percent above the Fed Funds
overnight rate, which is the rate that banks charge each other for the overnight borrowing of funds. This agreement remains in effect until canceled by KBC Bank NV. This agreement does not contain any covenants more restrictive than those in our
$10 billion five-year credit agreement.  Maximum short-term debt from all
sources, as approved by our Board of Directors, is $12 billion.  J
LONG-TERM DEBT  The aggregate maturities of long-term debt outstanding at
December 31, 2004, are $3415 million; $3065 million; $66 million; $4091 million; and $1076 million for 2005 through 2009, respectively, including $60 million, which is callable at option of the holder in each of those years. Additionally 1857 million is callable at par at our option from now until maturity, which is 2019 for $933 million and 2028 for $924 million.  In the first quarter of 2003, we issued long-term debt concurrent with our public equity offering. We issued a total of 161 million equity units at the public offering
price of $25 per unit for a total of $4025 million. Each equity unit consists of a stock purchase contract for the purchase of shares of our common stock and, initially, a senior note due February 16, 2008, issued pursuant to our existing Indenture
with SunTrust Bank, as trustee. The equity units carry a total annual coupon rate of 85 percent 40 percent annual face amount of the senior notes plus 45 percent annual contract adjustment payments. The interest expense associated with the 40
percent senior notes will be recognized in the income statement on an accrual basis over the term of the senior notes. The present value of the contract adjustment payments was accrued as a liability with a charge to equity at the time of the
transactions. Accordingly, there will be no impact on earnings in future periods as this liability is paid, except for the interest recognized as a result of discounting the liability to its present value at the time of the transaction. This
interest expense associated with the discounting will be approximately $35 million over three years. 
86 Table of Contents In June 2002, we issued $35 million of long-term variable rate debt, which is secured by our corporate airplane, at an
interest rate of 125 percent over LIBOR. All remaining long-term notes payable are unsecured. In August 2002, we completed a tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding 844 percent Senior Notes due 2004 and the 832 percent Senior Notes due
2007 for a total purchase price of approximately $65 million. The total purchase price included a premium of approximately $29 million and consent fees of approximately $18 million to purchase the notes, which are reflected in interest expense in
the income statement. In April 2002, we retired $240 million of two-year floating rate notes that were issued in April 2000. The interest rate for these notes reset quarterly at a 065 percent spread over the three-month LIBOR. The proceeds from the
notes were used to fund acquisitions.  We are subject to the risk of
fluctuation in interest rates in the normal course of business. We manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and, at times, interest rate swaps. Currently, $740 million of fixed rate debt is swapped to
floating. The floating rate debt is based on both three and six-month LIBOR. Based on the current LIBOR strip, the weighted average rate on the $740 million will be reduced from 681 percent to 454 percent. At December 31, 2004, we had a net
liability of $176 million recorded in energy marketing and risk management liabilities to reflect the fair value of the current interest rate swaps. Long-term debt reflects the offset to the fair value of the swaps with a decrease in overall debt

covenants that relate to liens and sale/leaseback transactions. On March 1, 2005, we had $335 million of long-term debt mature. We funded this payment with working capital and the issuance of commercial paper in the short-term market.  K EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS  Retirement and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans  Retirement Plans - We have defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans
covering substantially all employees. Nonbargaining unit employees hired after December 31, 2004 are not eligible for our defined benefit pension plan; however, they are covered by a profit sharing plan. Certain officers and key employees are also
eligible to participate in supplemental retirement plans. We generally fund pension costs at a level equal to the minimum amount required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. 
87 Table of Contents We elected to delay recognition of the accumulated benefit obligation and amortize it over 20 years as a component of net
periodic postretirement benefit cost. The accumulated benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension plan was $6813 million and $6259 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Other Postretirement Benefit Plans - We sponsor welfare care plans that provide
postretirement medical benefits and life insurance benefits to substantially all employees who retire under the retirement plans with at least five years of service. The postretirement medical plan is contributory, with retiree contributions
adjusted periodically, and contains other cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance. Nonbargaining unit employees retiring between the ages of 50 and 55 who elect postretirement medical coverage, and all nonbargaining unit employees
hired on or after January 1, 1999, employees who are members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers hired after June 30, 2003 and gas union employees hired after July 1, 2004 who elect postretirement medical coverage, pay 100 percent
of the retiree premium for participation in the plan. Additionally, any employees who came to us through various acquisitions may be further limited in their eligibility to participate or receive any contributions from us for postretirement medical
benefits.  In May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106-2,
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 FSP FAS 106-2 as guidance on how employers should account for provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 Medicare Reform Act. We adopted FSP FAS 106-2 in the second quarter of 2004. FSP FAS 106-2 superseded FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106-1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which we adopted in the first quarter of 2004. The Medicare Reform Act allows employers who sponsor a postretirement health care plan that provides a prescription drug benefit to
receive a subsidy for the cost of providing that drug benefit. In order for employers to receive the subsidy payment under the Medicare Reform Act, the value of the offered prescription drug plan must be at least actuarially equivalent to the
standard prescription drug coverage provided under Medicare Part D. Due to our lower deductibles and better coverage of drug costs, we believe that our plan is of greater value than Medicare Part D and will meet the actuarially equivalent
definitions. The reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation related to benefits attributed to past service was $156 million. The amortization for the actuarial experience gain as a component of the net amortization was $12
million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The reduction in current period service cost due to the subsidy was $05 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. There was a $10 million reduction to the interest cost on the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation for the year ended December 31, 2004. We believe that our plan will continue to provide drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D, that our plan will continue to be the primary plan
for our retirees and that we will receive the subsidy. We do not expect that the Medicare Reform Act will have a significant effect on our retirees participation in our postretirement benefit plan.  Measurement - We use a September 30 measurement date for the majority of our plans.
Our plans were remeasured as of November 30, 2004 due to the Northern Plains acquisition. This remeasurement will affect our pension and postretirement benefit expense beginning March 1, 2005.

91 Table of Contents As part of our risk management for the plans, minimums and maximums have been set for each of the asset classes listed
above. All investment managers for the plan are subject to certain restrictions on the securities they purchase and, with the exception of indexing purposes, are prohibited from owning our stock.  Contributions - For 2004, $68 million and $172 million of contributions were made to
our pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan, respectively. We presently anticipate our total 2005 contributions will be $18 million for the pension plan and $161 million for the other postretirement benefit plan.  Pension Benefit Payments - The benefits expected to be paid in 2005-2009 are $425
million, $437 million, $450 million, $463 million and $482 million, respectively. The aggregate benefits expected to be paid in the five years from 2010-2014 are $2678 million. The expected benefits to be paid are based on the same assumptions
used to measure our benefit obligation at December 31, 2004, and include estimated future employee service.  Regulatory Treatment - The OCC and KCC have approved the recovery of pension costs and other postretirement benefits costs through rates for Oklahoma Natural Gas and Kansas Gas Service, respectively. The costs
recovered through rates are based on current funding requirements and the net periodic postretirement benefits cost for pension and postretirement costs. Differences, if any, between the expense and the amount recovered through rates are charged to
earnings.  Other Employee Benefit Plans  Thrift Plan - We have a Thrift Plan covering substantially all employees. Employee
contributions are discretionary. Subject to certain limits, we match employee contributions. The cost of the plan was $104 million, $96 million and $85 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Profit Sharing Plan - We have a profit sharing plan for all nonbargaining unit
employees hired after December 31, 2004. Nonbargaining unit employees who were employed prior to January 1, 2005, were given a one-time opportunity to make an irrevocable election to participate in the profit sharing plan and not accrue any
additional benefits under our defined benefit pension plan after December 31, 2004. We plan to make a contribution to the profit sharing plan each quarter equal to one percent of each participants compensation during the quarter. Additional
discretionary employer contributions may be made at the end of each year. Employee contributions are not allowed under the plan.  L COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  Leases - The initial lease term of our headquarters building, ONEOK Plaza, is for 25 years, expiring in 2009, with six five-year renewal options. At the end of the
initial term or any renewal period, we can purchase the property at its fair market value. Annual rent expense for the lease will be approximately $68 million until 2009. Rent payments were $93 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002. Estimated future
minimum rental payments for the lease are $93 million for each of the years ending December 31, 2005 through 2009.  We have the right to sublet excess office space in ONEOK Plaza. We received rental revenue of $28 million, $28 million and $32 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Estimated minimum future rental payments to be received under existing contracts for subleases are $27 million in 2005, $25 million in 2006, $12 million in 2007, $12 million in 2008 and $07 million in 2009.  Other operating leases include a gas processing plant, office buildings, and equipment.
Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2004, are $381 million in 2005, $511 million in 2006, $327 million in 2007, $302 million in 2008 and $278 million in 2009. These amounts include the
following minimum lease payments relating to the lease of a gas processing plant for which we have a liability as a result of uneconomic lease terms: $242 million in 2005, $377 million in 2006, $242 million in 2007, $242 million in 2008 and
$240 million in 2009. Accordingly, the liability is amortized to rent expense in the amount of $130 million per year over the term of the lease. The amortization of the liability reduces rent expense; however, the cash outflow under the lease
remains the same.  Environmental - We are subject to multiple
environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid wastes and hazardous material and substance management. These laws and regulations
generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, permits and 
92 Table of Contents licenses may expose us to fines, penalties and/or interruptions in our operations that could be material to the results
of operations. If an accidental leak or spill of hazardous materials occurs from our lines or facilities, in the process of transporting natural gas or NGLs, or at any facility that we own, operate or otherwise use, we could be held jointly and
severally liable for all resulting liabilities, including investigation and clean up costs, which could materially affect our results, operations and cash flow. In addition, emission controls required under the Federal Clean Air Act and other
similar federal and state laws could require unexpected capital expenditures at our facilities. We cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us.
Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.  We own or retain legal responsibility for
the environmental conditions at 12 former manufactured gas sites in Kansas. These sites contain potentially harmful materials that are subject to control or remediation under various environmental laws and regulations. A consent agreement with the
Kansas Department of Health and Environment KDHE presently governs all work at these sites. The terms of the consent agreement allow us to investigate these sites and set remediation activities based upon the results of the investigations and risk
analysis. We have commenced active remediation on six sites with regulatory closure achieved at two of these locations, and have begun assessments at the remaining sites. The site situations are not similar and we have no previous experience with
similar remediation efforts. We have completed some analysis of the remaining six sites, but are unable to accurately estimate individual or aggregate costs that may be required to satisfy the remedial obligations.  Our preliminary review of similar cleanup efforts at former manufactured gas sites reveals
that costs can range from $100,000 to $10 million per site. These estimates do not give effect to potential insurance recoveries, recoveries through rates or from unaffiliated parties, to which we may be entitled. At this time, we have not recorded
any amounts for potential insurance recoveries or recoveries from unaffiliated parties, and we are not recovering any environmental amounts in rates. Total costs to remediate the two sites, which have achieved regulatory closure, was approximately
$700,000. Total remedial costs for each of the remaining sites are expected to exceed $500,000 per site, but there is no assurance that costs to investigate and remediate the remaining sites will not be significantly higher. As more information
related to the site investigations and remediation activities becomes available, and to the extent such amounts are expected to exceed our current estimates, additional expenses could be recorded. Such amounts could be material to our results of
operations and cash flows depending on the remediation done and number of years over which the remediation is completed.  Our expenditures for environmental evaluation and remediation to date have not been significant in relation to the results of operations and there were no material
effects upon earnings during 2004 related to compliance with environmental regulations.  Yaggy Facility - In January 2001, our Yaggy gas storage facilitys operating parameters were changed as mandated by the KDHE following natural gas explosions and eruptions of natural gas geysers in or near Hutchison, Kansas. In
July 2002, the KDHE issued an administrative order that assessed a civil penalty against us, based on alleged violations of several KDHE regulations. On April 5, 2004, we entered into a Consent Order with the KDHE in which we paid a civil penalty in
the amount of $180,000 and reimbursed the KDHE for its costs related to the investigation of the incident in the amount of approximately $79,000. In addition, the Consent Order requires us to conduct an environmental remediation and a geoengineering
study. Based on information currently available to us, we do not believe there are any material adverse effects resulting from the Consent Order.  In February 2004, a jury awarded the plaintiffs in a lawsuit involving property damage alleged to relate to the gas explosions and eruptions, $17 million in actual
damages. In April 2004, the judge in this case awarded punitive damages in the amount of $525 million. We have filed an appeal of the jury verdict and the punitive damage award. Based on information currently available to us, we believe our legal
reserves and insurance coverage is adequate and that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on us.  The two class action lawsuits filed against us in connection with the natural gas explosions and eruptions of natural gas geysers that occurred at, and in the vicinity
of, our Yaggy facility in January 2001 resulted in jury verdicts in September 2004. The jury awarded the plaintiffs in the residential class $5 million in actual damages, which is covered by insurance. In the other class action relating to business
claims, the jury awarded no actual damages. The jury rejected claims for punitive damages in both cases. We are reviewing our options for appealing the verdict rendered in the residential claimants class action. 
93 Table of Contents With the exception of appeals, all litigation regarding our Yaggy facility has been resolved.  Enron - We have repurchased a portion of the Enron Corp. guaranty claim that Enron
Corp. and Enron North American Corp. ENA sought to avoid in the adversary proceeding. We are now providing the defense of the adversary proceeding for both the portion of the guaranty claim constituting the repurchased claim and also the portion
of the guaranty claim previously sold. Based on information currently available to us, we do not expect the adversary proceeding to have a material adverse effect on us.  In addition to the adversary proceeding, Enron Corp. and ENA have filed a new objection to portions of the guaranty claim and to portions of
the underlying claim against ENA, creating a new contested matter in the Enron Corp. and ENA bankruptcy cases which involve different legal and factual issues than those raised in the adversary proceeding. Enron Corp. and ENA allege in this matter
that the guaranty claim and underlying claim against ENA are overstated. The filing of this matter may trigger additional obligations for us to repurchase some of the claims previously sold. Based on the information currently available to us, we do
not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on us.  Other -
The OCC staff filed an application on February 1, 2001, to review the gas procurement practices of Oklahoma Natural Gas in acquiring its gas supply for the 2000/2001 heating season and to determine if these practices were consistent with least cost
procurement practices and whether our procurement decisions resulted in fair, just and reasonable costs being borne by Oklahoma Natural Gas customers. In May 2002, we, along with the staff of the Public Utility Division and the Consumer Services
Division of the OCC, the Oklahoma Attorney General, and other stipulating parties, entered into a joint settlement agreement resolving this gas cost issue and ongoing litigation related to a contract with Dynamic Energy Resources, Inc. 
The settlement agreement will be realized over a three-year period. In July
2002, immediate cash savings were provided to all Oklahoma Natural Gas customers in the form of billing credits with $10 million available for former customers returning to the Oklahoma Natural Gas system. If the additional $10 million is not
fully refunded to customers returning to the Oklahoma Natural Gas system by December 2005, the remainder will be included in the final billing credit. Oklahoma Natural Gas replaced certain gas contracts, which is expected to reduce gas costs by
approximately $138 million, due to avoided reservation fees between April 2003 and October 2005. Additional savings of approximately $80 million from the use of storage service in lieu of those contracts are expected to occur between November 2003
and March 2005. Any expected savings from the use of storage that are not achieved, any remaining billing credits not issued to returning customers and an additional $18 million credit will be added to the final billing credit scheduled to be
provided to customers in December 2005.  We are a party to other litigation
matters and claims, which are normal in the course of our operations. While the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately $1570 million, which will expire, unless utilized, at various dates through 2023. The valuation allowance attributable to our state net operating losses was $605 million, $34 million
tax effected, at December 31, 2004. The valuation allowance reflects managements uncertainty as to the realization of a portion of our state net operating losses before they expire. All federal net operating loss carryforwards have been
utilized.  At December 31, 2004, we had $55 million in deferred investment tax
credits related to regulated operations recorded in other deferred credits, which will be amortized over the next 11 years.  We had accrued income taxes of approximately $05 million and $710 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  N SEGMENT INFORMATION  We have divided our operations into six reportable segments based on similarities in economic characteristics, products and services, types
of customers, methods of distribution and regulatory environment. These segments are as follows: 1 the Production segment develops and produces natural gas and oil; 2 the Gathering and Processing segment gathers and processes natural gas and
fractionates, stores and markets NGLs; 3 the Transportation and Storage segment gathers, transports and stores natural gas for others and buys and sells natural gas; 4 the Distribution segment distributes natural gas to residential, commercial
and industrial customers, and transports gas; 5 the Energy Services segment markets natural gas and oil to wholesale and retail customers and markets electricity to wholesale customers; and 6 the Other segment, which acquired Northern Plains in
November 2004, primarily consists of Northern Plains and the operating and leasing operations of our headquarters building and a related parking facility.  The Production segment primarily sells to gatherers and processors in the natural gas industry. The main customers for the Gathering and Processing segment are
petrochemical and refining companies along with propane wholesalers and natural gas marketing companies. Companies serviced by the Transportation and Storage segment include LDCs, power generators, natural gas marketing companies and petrochemical
companies. The Distribution segment provides natural gas to residential, commercial, industrial, wholesale, public authority and transportation customers. The Energy Services segment buys and 
96 Table of Contents sells natural gas and power to LDCs, municipalities, producers, large industrials, power generators, retail aggregators
and other marketing companies as well as residential and small commercial/industrial companies.  As discussed in Note D, at the beginning of the third quarter of 2004 we completed a reorganization of our Energy Services segment and separated the management and operations of our physical marketing, retail
marketing and trading activities. We began accounting separately for the different types of revenue earned from these activities with certain revenues accounted for on a gross rather than a net basis.  The accounting policies of the segments are described in Note A. Intersegment gross sales are
recorded on the same basis as sales to unaffiliated customers. Corporate overhead costs relating to a reportable segment have been allocated for the purpose of calculating operating income. Our equity method investments do not represent operating
segments.  In 2004, we had one customer, BP PLC BP, from which we received
$7451 million, or approximately 12 percent of consolidated revenues. The Energy Services segment received $6644 million of the total revenues received million from BP, or approximately 11 percent, of consolidated revenues. We have no other single
external customer from which we received ten percent or more of our consolidated gross revenues for the periods covered by this report.  The following tables set forth certain selected financial information for our six operating segments for the periods indicated.  Regulated

Q STOCK BASED COMPENSATION  Deferred Compensation Plans  Employee Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan - The ONEOK, Inc. Employee Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan the Prior Deferred Comp Plan provides
select employees, as approved by the Board of Directors, with the option to defer portions of their compensation and provides non-qualified deferred compensation benefits which are not available due to limitations on employer and employee
contributions to qualified defined contribution plans under the federal tax laws. Under the plan, participants have the option to defer a portion of their salary and/or bonus compensation to a short-term deferral account, which pays out a minimum of
five years from commencement, or a long-term deferral account, which pays out at retirement or termination of the participants employment. Participants are immediately 100 percent vested. Short-term deferral accounts are credited with a deemed
investment return based on the five year treasury bond fund. Long-term deferral accounts are credited with a deemed investment return based on various investment options, which, beginning in May 2004, do not include an option to invest in our common
stock. At the distribution date, cash is distributed to participants based on the fair market value of the deemed investment of the participant account at that date.  On December 16, 2004, our Board of Directors approved certain amendments to our Prior Deferred Comp Plan, including amendments providing
that the Prior Deferred Comp Plan would terminate and be frozen effective December 31, 2004, as to eligibility of any new participants and the deferral of any compensation by a participant under the Prior Deferred Comp Plan after that date.
Participants in the Prior Deferred Comp Plan will be paid compensation they had deferred under the Prior Deferred Comp Plan on or before December 31, 2004, in accordance with the terms of the Prior Deferred Comp Plan.  Also, on December 16, 2004, our Board of Directors adopted the 2005 Employee Deferred
Compensation Plan the 2005 Deferred Comp Plan, which became effective January 1, 2005. The 2005 Deferred Comp Plan provides for deferral of compensation and payment of benefits in substantially the same manner as provided under the Prior Deferred
Comp Plan. However, the 2005 Deferred Comp Plan contains certain different provisions intended to comply with the requirements of the newly enacted Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Those provisions relate to participant elections to defer
compensation, the timing of payments and distributions under the 2005 Deferred Comp Plan, prohibition of any foreign trust for the 2005 Deferred Comp Plan, new defined terms, and certain other conforming provisions and features.  Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors - The ONEOK, Inc. Deferred
Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors provides our directors, who are not our employees, the option to defer all or a portion of their compensation for their service on our Board of Directors. Under the plan, directors may elect either a cash
deferral option or a phantom stock option. Under the cash deferral option, directors may defer the receipt of all or a portion of their annual retainer and/or meeting fees, plus accrued interest. Under the phantom stock option, directors may defer
all or a portion of 
100 Table of Contents their annual retainer and/or meeting fees and receive such fees on a deferred basis in the form of shares of common stock
under our Long-Term Incentive Plan. Shares are distributed to non-employee directors at the fair market value of our common stock at the date of distribution. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan  General - The ONEOK, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan the LTIP provides for the granting of stock-based compensation, including incentive stock options,
non-statutory stock options, stock bonus awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards to key employees and the granting of stock awards to non-employee directors. We have reserved a total of approximately
78 million shares of common stock for issuance under the plan. The maximum number of shares for which options or other awards may be granted to any employee during any year is 300,000. The number of shares of stock to be paid and distributed to
non-employee directors is determined by dividing the dollar amount of the director fees that are to be paid in common stock on any payment date by the fair market value of a share of common stock on that date.  In February 2005, our Board of Directors approved the ONEOK, Inc. Equity Compensation Plan,
which will replace the LTIP. Subject to shareholder approval, 30 million shares of our common stock will be available for issuance.  Options - Under the LTIP, stock options may be granted to key employees. The LTIP is administered by the Executive Compensation Committee the Committee. Stock
options and awards may be granted at any time until all shares authorized are transferred, except that no incentive stock option may be granted under the plan after August 17, 2005. Options may be granted which are not exercisable until a fixed
future date or in installments. Prior to 2002, our stock option agreements provided for restored options to be granted. A restored option is granted in the event an optionee surrenders shares of common stock that the optionee already owns in full or
partial payment of the option price of an option being exercised and/or surrenders shares of common stock to satisfy withholding tax obligations incident to the exercise of an option. A restored option is for the number of shares surrendered by the
optionee and has an option price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date on which the exercise of an option resulted in the grant of the restored option.  Options issued to date become void upon voluntary termination of employment other than retirement. In the event of retirement or involuntary
termination, the optionee may exercise the option within a period determined by the Committee and stated in the option. In the event of death, the option may be exercised by the personal representative of the optionee within a period to be
determined by the Committee and stated in the option. A portion of the options issued to date can be exercised after one year from grant date and an option must be exercised no later than ten years after grant date. Restored options are exercisable
at any time after six months following the grant date and expire on the expiration of the original grant.  Restricted Stock Awards - Under the LTIP, restricted stock awards may be granted to key employees with ownership of the common stock vesting over a period determined by the Committee and stated in the award.
Those granted to date vest over a three-year period. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of the award. Shares awarded may not be sold during the vesting period. Dividends on restricted stock awards are
reinvested in common stock.  Restricted Stock Incentive Units - Under
the LTIP, restricted stock incentive units may be granted to key employees with ownership of the incentive unit vesting over a period determined by the Committee and stated in the award. Those granted to date vest over a three-year period at which
time the grantee is entitled to receive two-thirds of the grant in shares of our common stock and one-third of the grant in cash. No dividends are paid on the restricted stock incentive units. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the period of the award.  Performance Unit Awards - Under the
LTIP, performance unit awards may be granted to key employees. The performance units vest at the expiration of a period determined by the Committee and stated in the award if certain performance criteria are met by the company. Those granted to date
vest at the expiration of a three-year period. Upon vesting, a holder of performance shares is entitled to receive a number of shares of our common stock equal to a percentage 0 percent to 200 percent of the performance shares granted based on our
total shareholder return over vesting period, compared to the total shareholder return of a peer group of 20 other companies over the same period. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of the award with
adjustments as needed based on company performance. Awards granted in 2004 entitle the grantee to receive two-thirds of the grant in shares of our common stock and one-third of the grant in cash, while awards granted in 2003 were common stock only.
101 Table of Contents Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors  General - The ONEOK, Inc. Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors the DSCP provides for the granting of stock bonus
awards, including performance unit awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards and options. Under the DSCP, these awards may be granted by the Committee at any time on or before January 18, 2011. We have reserved a total of 700,000
shares of common stock for issuance under the DSCP. The maximum number of shares of common stock which can be issued to a participant under the DSCP during any year is 20,000.  Options - Options may be exercisable in full at the time of grant or may become exercisable in one or more installments. The plan
also provides for restored options consistent with the plan for employees. Options must be exercised no later than ten years after the date of grant of the option. In the event of retirement or termination, the optionee may exercise the option
within a period determined by the Committee. In the event of death, the option may be exercised by the personal representative of the optionee over a period of time determined by the Committee.  Performance Unit Awards and Restricted Stock Awards - Under the DSCP, performance unit
awards and restricted stock awards may be granted at the discretion of the Committee under terms set by the Committee. These awards may be settled in cash or unrestricted shares of common stock. No performance unit awards or restricted stock awards
have been made to non-employee directors under the DSCP.  Stock Option

307,074 1836  Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The ONEOK, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP currently has 28
million shares reserved for issuance. Subject to certain exclusions, all full-time employees are eligible to participate. Under the terms of the plan, employees can choose to have up to ten percent of their annual base pay withheld to purchase our
common stock. The Committee may allow contributions to be made by other means, provided that in no event will contributions from all means exceed ten percent of the employees annual base pay. The purchase price of the stock is 85 percent of
the lower of its grant date or exercise date market price. Approximately 54 percent, 58 percent and 61 percent of employees participated in the plan in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Under the plan, we sold 449,090 shares at $1884 per share in
2004, 296,125 shares at $1623 per share in 2003, and 285,200 shares at $1506 per share in 2002.  In February 2005, our Board of Directors approved the ONEOK, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended. Upon shareholder approval, our common stock available for issuance under this plan will be increased to 38
million shares.  Accounting Treatment  We applied APB 25 in accounting for our equity benefit plans through 2002. Accordingly, no
compensation expense was recognized in the consolidated financial statements for our stock options and our ESPP. We adopted Statement 148 on January 1, 2003, and began expensing the fair value of all stock options granted on or after January 1,
2003. See Note A for disclosure of our pro forma net income and EPS information had we applied the provisions of Statement 123 to determine the compensation cost under these plans for stock options granted prior to January 1, 2003 for the periods
presented.  The fair market value of each option granted was estimated on the
date of grant based on the Black-Scholes model using the following assumptions: volatility of 213 percent for 2004, 303 percent for 2003, and 221 percent for 2002; dividend yield of 39 percent for 2004, 35 percent for 2003, and 36 percent for
2002; and risk-free interest rate of 34 percent for 2004, 40 percent for 2003, and 51 percent for 2002.  The expected life ranged from one to 10 years based upon experience to date and the make-up of the optionees. The fair value of options granted at fair market value under the Plan were $353, $467 and $388 for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  R EARNINGS
PER SHARE INFORMATION  Through February 5, 2003, we computed our EPS in
accordance with EITF Topic No. D-95 Topic D-95, which was subsequently superceded by EITF Issue No. 03-6, Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128. The dilutive effect of our Series A was
considered in the computation of basic EPS utilizing the if-converted method. Under the if-converted method, the dilutive effect of our Series A on EPS could not be less than the amount that would have resulted from the
application of the two-class method of computing EPS. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determined EPS for our common stock and our participating Series A according to dividends declared and
participating rights in the undistributed earnings. Our Series A was a participating instrument with our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2002 and the period from January 1, 2003 to February 5,
2003, the two-class method resulted in additional dilution. Accordingly, EPS for this period 
104 Table of Contents 
reflects this further dilution. As a result of our repurchase and exchange of our Series A in February 2003, we no longer applied the provisions of Topic
D-95 to our EPS computations beginning in February 2003.  The following table
sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS from continuing operations for the periods indicated.  Year Ended December 31, 2004 Income

option shares excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, since their inclusion would be antidilutive.  The repurchase and exchange of our Series A from Westar in February 2003 was recorded at fair value. In accordance with Topic No. D-42, the
premium, or the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred to Westar over the carrying value of the Series A, was considered a preferred dividend. The premium recorded on the repurchase and exchange of the Series A was approximately
$442 million and $534 million, respectively, for a total premium of $976 million. As a result of our adoption of Topic D-95, we recognized additional dilution of approximately $945 million through the application of the two-class
method of computing EPS. This additional dilution offsets the total premium recorded, resulting in a net premium of $31 million, which is reflected as a dividend on the Series A in the EPS calculation above for the year ended December 31, 2003.

107 Table of Contents T OIL AND GAS RESERVES UNAUDITED  The volumes of reserves shown are estimates, which, by their nature, are subject to later revision. We estimate the reserves utilizing all
available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually both internally and by an independent reserve engineer, Ralph E. Davis and Associates, and revised, either upward or downward, as
warranted by additional performance data.  The following table sets forth
estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves, net of royalty interests and changes herein, for the periods indicated.  ContinuingOperations DiscontinuedComponent Oil MBbls Gas MMcf Oil MBbls Gas MMcf December 31, 2001

108 Table of Contents Future cash inflows are computed by applying year-end prices averaging $4263 per barrel of oil, adjusted for
transportation and other charges, and $575 per Mcf of gas at December 31, 2004 to the year-end quantities of proved reserves. As of December 31, 2004, a portion of 2005 proved developed gas production has been hedged. The effects of these hedges
are not reflected in the computation of future cash flows above. If the effects of the hedges had been included, the future cash inflows would have decreased by approximately $41 million.  These estimated future cash flows are reduced by estimated future development and production
costs based on year-end cost levels, assuming continuation of existing economic conditions, and by estimated future income tax expense. The tax expense is calculated by applying the current year-end statutory tax rates to pretax net cash flows net
of tax depreciation, depletion and lease amortization allowances applicable to oil and gas production.  The following table sets forth the changes in standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow relating to proved oil and gas reserves for the periods indicated.
