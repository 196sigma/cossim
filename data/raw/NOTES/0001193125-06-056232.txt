REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders Tumbleweed Communications Corp.: We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tumbleweed Communications Corp. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive loss, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Tumbleweed Communications Corp. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Tumbleweed Communications Corp.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March16, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of, and the effective
operation of, internal control over financial reporting. /s/KPMG LLP Mountain View, California March16, 2006

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders Tumbleweed Communications Corp.: We have audited managements assessment, included in
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A, that Tumbleweed Communications Corp. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria
established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Management of Tumbleweed Communications Corp. is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting of Tumbleweed Communications Corp. based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Tumbleweed Communications Corp. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, Tumbleweed Communications Corp. maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets
of Tumbleweed Communications Corp. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive loss, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2005, and our report dated March16, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. /s/KPMG LLP Mountain View, California March16, 2006

TUMBLEWEED COMMUNICATIONS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 1Organization Tumbleweed Communications Corp. Tumbleweed is a recognized leader in
providing secure Internet communication solutions for enterprise and government customers of all sizes. With Tumbleweed products, organizations can block security threats, protect information, safely conduct business online, and reduce their cost of
doing business. 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Consolidation Policy The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tumbleweed and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations of
Tumbleweeds wholly-owned subsidiaries, Valicert, Inc. Valicert, Incubator, Limited Incubator, and Corvigo, Inc. Corvigo, have been included commencing June23, 2003,March15, 2004, and
March18, 2004, the effective dates of those acquisitions, respectively. Cash and Cash Equivalents Tumbleweed considers all highly liquid investments purchased with remaining maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments, which potentially subject Tumbleweed to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Tumbleweeds cash equivalents generally consist of money market mutual funds
with qualified financial institutions. To reduce credit risk with accounts receivable, Tumbleweed performs periodic evaluations of its customers financial condition and, when necessary, records an allowance for credit losses. No single
customer comprised 10% or more of Tumbleweed accounts receivable balance at December31, 2005. One customer comprised 14% of Tumbleweeds accounts receivable balance, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, at December31, 2004. This
balance was collected in full in the first quarter of 2005. For 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, no single customer comprised 10% or more of Tumbleweeds revenue. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, generally 2 to 5 years for computers, software, furniture, and equipment; and the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term for
leasehold improvements. Tumbleweed recorded depreciation expense of $11 million, $15 million, and $14million, for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Maintenance and repairs are recorded as expenses as incurred. Renewals and betterments that materially extend the lives of assets are capitalized and depreciated. Upon disposal, the assets cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and any resulting gain or loss is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. Capitalized Software Development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements
to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility in the form of a working model 
46 Table of Contents TUMBLEWEED COMMUNICATIONS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
has been established. To date, capitalized costs for software development have not been material. The period between the achievement of technological
feasibility and the general release of Tumbleweeds products has typically been of short duration. Letters of Credit
As of December31, 2005, Tumbleweed included restricted cash in the amount of $24,000 as a part of Other current assets on its
consolidated balance sheet. Tumbleweed had restricted cash in the amounts of $541,000 and $500,000 included as a part of Other assets on its consolidated balance sheets as of December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The restricted cash
primarily relates to letters of credit held by the lessors of Tumbleweeds Redwood City, California, Palo Alto, California, and Sofia, Bulgaria office operating leases. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Tumbleweed assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that are considered important, which
could trigger an impairment review, include the following:  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;  significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business;  significant negative industry or economic trends;  significant decline in Tumbleweeds stock price for a sustained period; and  Tumbleweeds market capitalization relative to its net book value. Recoverability of intangible assets held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are
considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets, generally using discounted net cash flows. Assets to be disposed of are reported at
the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. In connection with the acquisitions of Corvigo, Incubator, and
Valicert on March18, 2004,March15, 2004, and June23, 2003, respectively, Tumbleweed recognized $334 million, $14 million, and $133 million of goodwill, respectively, representing the excess of the respective purchase
prices over the fair values of the acquired net tangible and identified intangible assets. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
SFAS 142, the goodwill acquired in the Corvigo, Incubator, and Valicert acquisitions will not be amortized, but instead, the goodwill balances will be tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently if certain impairment
conditions exist. Any future impairment loss related to the goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisitions of Corvigo, Incubator, and Valicert will not be deductible by Tumbleweed for federal income tax purposes. Revenue Recognition Tumbleweed
derives its revenue from three sources: iproduct revenue, which includes license fees for products sold as software or on appliances, subscription-based license fees, and transaction-based license fees; iiservice revenue, which
includes support and maintenance fees, consulting fees, and training fees; and iiiintellectual property and other revenue which includes patent license agreement fees and the sale of distribution rights. As described below, significant
management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period. Material differences may result in the 
47 Table of Contents TUMBLEWEED COMMUNICATIONS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates. Tumbleweed recognizes revenue in accordance with Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition SOP
97-2, as amended by SOP 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition With Respect to Certain Transactions SOP 98-9, and generally recognizes revenue when all of the following
criteria are met as set forth in paragraph 8 of SOP 97-2: 1persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, 2delivery has occurred; 3the fee is fixed or determinable; and 4collectibility is probable. Tumbleweed allocates
revenue on software transactions referred to as an arrangement in the accounting literature involving multiple elements to each undelivered element based on their respective fair values. The residual is allocated to the product
license. Tumbleweeds determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE. Tumbleweed limits its assessment of VSOE of fair value for each element to the
price charged when the same element is sold separately. Tumbleweeds recognition of revenue is based on its assessment of the
probability of collecting the accounts receivable balance on a customer-by-customer basis. As a result, the timing or amount of revenue recognition is dependent on the assessment of collectibility made at the time of transaction. Tumbleweed assesses
collectibility based on a number of factors, including transaction history and the creditworthiness of the customer. Tumbleweed does not request collateral from its customers. If Tumbleweed determined that collection of a fee is not probable, it
defers the fee and recognizes revenue upon receipt of payment. Tumbleweed considers payment terms where fees are due within ninety days to
be normal. Payment terms beyond ninety days are considered extended and not fixed or determinable. For contracts with extended payment terms, revenues are recognized when fees become due and payable. Arrangements that include consulting services are evaluated to determine whether those services are essential to the functionality of other elements of
the arrangement. When services are not considered essential, the revenue allocable to the services is recognized separately from the software, provided VSOE of fair value exists. If Tumbleweed provided consulting services that are considered
essential to the functionality of the software products, both the product revenue and service revenue are recognized under contract accounting in accordance with the provisions of SOP 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and
Certain Production-Type Contracts. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized under the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of direct labor hours incurred to date to total projected labor costs except in limited circumstances
where completion status cannot be reasonably estimated, in which case the completed contract method is used. Tumbleweeds software
products are typically fully functional upon delivery and do not require significant modification or alteration. For arrangements where services are not essential to the functionality of the software, customers typically purchase consulting services
to facilitate the adoption of Tumbleweeds technology, but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other professional service organizations to perform these services. Software products are generally billed separately and
independently from professional services, which are generally billed on a time-and-materials basis. For time-and-materials contracts, Tumbleweed recognizes revenue as the services are performed. Tumbleweed occasionally offers fixed fee professional
services engagements. For fixed dollar consulting contracts with milestones or acceptance provisions, revenue is recognized upon completion of a milestone or acceptance, if applicable. Tumbleweed recognizes revenue from patent license agreements and from the sale of distribution rights when ithe patent license or distribution
agreement is executed, iithe amounts due are fixed, determinable, and billable, and iiicollection of the resulting receivable is probable. 
48 Table of Contents TUMBLEWEED COMMUNICATIONS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Tumbleweed typically grants its customers a warranty which guarantees that its products will
substantially conform to its current specifications for 60 days from the delivery date. Services to be provided under a warranty are consistent with the services performed under support and maintenance purchased by almost all of Tumbleweeds
customers. Tumbleweed provides for the estimated cost of product and service warranties based on specific warranty claims received, provided that it is probable that a liability exists, and provided the cost to repair or otherwise satisfy the claim
can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the reserve recorded is equal to the costs to repair or otherwise satisfy the claim. Historically, costs related to warranty claims not covered by a support and maintenance agreement have not been
significant. Advertising Tumbleweed expenses advertising costs as incurred. Total advertising expense was $111,000, $179,000, and $100,000 for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit
carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded
to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount whose realization is more likely than not. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Stock-Based Compensation Tumbleweeds stock-based compensation program is a broad-based, long-term retention program that is intended to attract and retain employees and align stockholder and employee interests. Tumbleweed accounts for its stock-based
compensation arrangements for employees using the intrinsic-value method pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25. As such, stock-based compensation expense is recorded
for fixed plan stock options on the date of grant when the fair value of the underlying common stock exceeds the exercise price for stock options or the purchase price for issuance or sales of common stock. Expense associated with stock-based
compensation is amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the individual award consistent with the method described in FASB Interpretation 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award
Plans. During 2005, Tumbleweed recorded deferred stock-based compensation of $178,000 to recognize the fair value of stock options
granted to certain non-employees for professional services. The assumptions used to value the option grants were a contractual term of 10 years, volatility of 100%, risk-free interest rate of 415%, and dividend yield of 0%. This deferred
stock-based compensation is amortized over twelve month periods, which are the expected periods over which the related services will occur. Stock-based compensation expense recognized during 2005 also included expense resulting from a separation
agreement with a former employee. The separation agreement modified the former employees existing stock options by extending the vesting period beyond the original terms of the stock option grants. During 2004, Tumbleweed recorded deferred stock-based compensation of $351,000 to recognize the fair value of stock options granted to certain
non-employees for professional services. The assumptions used to value 
49 Table of Contents TUMBLEWEED COMMUNICATIONS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
the option grants were a contractual term of 10 years, volatility of 100%, risk-free interest rates ranging from 258% to 327% depending on the date of the
grant, and dividend yield of 0%. This deferred stock-based compensation was amortized over twelve month periods, which are the expected periods over which the related services were expected to occur. During, 2004, Tumbleweed recorded deferred stock-based compensation of $1,397,000 for the difference at the effective date of the acquisition of Corvigo
between the exercise price and the fair value of the common stock underlying the unvested options assumed upon the acquisition, multiplied by the ratio representing the remaining vesting period of the options assumed. During 2003, Tumbleweed
recorded deferred stock compensation of $528,000 for the difference at the effective date of the acquisition of Valicert between the exercise price and the fair value of the common stock underlying the unvested options assumed upon the acquisition.
Amortization of deferred stock compensation expense of approximately $510,000, $640,000, and $166,000 was recognized in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Had stock-based compensation expense for Tumbleweeds stock-based compensation plans been determined consistent with the fair value approach set forth in SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS 123, Tumbleweeds net losses for 2005, 2004, and 2003, would have been as follows in thousands, except per share amounts:  2005 2004 2003 Net loss as reported 3,909 7,497 9,187 Add: Stock-based compensation expense included in net loss 510 640 166 Less: Total stock-based compensation determined under fair value based method for all awards 10,650 8,812 5,216 Net loss pro forma 14,049 15,669 14,237 Basic and diluted net loss per share as reported 008 016 026 Basic and diluted net loss per share pro forma 029 033 040 For purposes of computing pro forma net loss, the fair value of each option grant was estimated on

pursuant to SFAS 123. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R, which
revises SFAS 123 and supersedes APB 25. SFAS 123R requires Tumbleweed to recognize in its financial statements the fair value of all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, 
50 Table of Contents TUMBLEWEED COMMUNICATIONS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
effective at the beginning of the next fiscal year that starts after June15, 2005. Tumbleweed will adopt SFAS123R in the first quarter of 2006,
beginning January1, 2006. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition. Under SFAS123R, Tumbleweed must determine the appropriate fair value model to be
used for valuing share-based payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption. The transition methods include modified prospective and modified retroactive adoption options. Under the
modified retroactive options, prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented. The modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock
options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of SFAS 123R, while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period
restated. Tumbleweed is evaluating the requirements of SFAS 123R and expects that the adoption of SFAS 123R will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results of operations and earnings per share. Tumbleweed has not yet determined the
method of adoption or the effect of adopting SFAS 123R, and has not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123. On July19, 2005, Tumbleweeds Board of Directors approved the acceleration of vesting of certain unvested stock options with exercise prices
equal to or greater than $382 per share previously awarded to its employees including its executive officers and its directors under its stock option plans. The acceleration of vesting was effective for stock options outstanding as of
July19, 2005. Options to purchase approximately 17million shares of common stock were accelerated. All of the options accelerated had exercise prices greater than Tumbleweeds common stock price of $324 on the date of
acceleration. The weighted average exercise price of the options accelerated was $500. Since the exercise price of all of the accelerated options exceeded Tumbleweeds common stock price on the date of acceleration, no stock-based compensation
expense was recognized as a result of the acceleration. The purpose of the acceleration was to enable Tumbleweed to avoid recognizing compensation expense associated with these options in future periods in its consolidated statement of operations
upon adoption of SFAS 123R. Net Loss Per Share Basic net loss per common share has been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less shares subject to repurchase. The following table presents the calculation of basic and
diluted net loss per share in thousands, except per share amounts:  Years Ended December31 2005 2004 2003 Net loss 3,909 7,497 9,187 Weighted average shares used in computing basic and diluted net loss per common share 48,627 46,777 36,007 Net loss per sharebasic and diluted 008 016 026

5,990 Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair values of Tumbleweeds cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values due to the short
maturity or variable-rate structure of those instruments. Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable Tumbleweed records as deferred revenue any billed amounts due from customers in excess of revenues recognized. Advance payments are also recorded as
deferred revenue until the products are shipped, services are delivered, or obligations are met. Accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers for which revenue has been recognized or amounts are legally due. Tumbleweed evaluates the
collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In cases where Tumbleweed is aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customers ability to meet its financial obligations, Tumbleweed records a specific
allowance against amounts owed to it by that customer, and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected. If all collection efforts have been exhausted, Tumbleweed writes off the receivable
against the allowance. In addition, Tumbleweed analyzes its accounts receivable balance in total, including review of historical bad debts, current economic trends, aging of the balances and estimated collectibility percentages for different aging
ranges, and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Specifically, there are significant judgments related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, the valuation of long-term assets, accrued liabilities, accrued merger-related and other
costs, and revenue recognition. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Foreign Currency The functional currency for each foreign subsidiary is its respective local currency. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities related to these operations
are translated at the current exchange rates at the end of each period. The resulting cumulative translation adjustments are recorded directly to the accumulated other comprehensive 
52 Table of Contents TUMBLEWEED COMMUNICATIONS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
loss account in stockholders equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect during the period. Foreign currency
transaction gains and losses are included in the results of operations. At December31, 2005 and 2004, no foreign currency transactions were hedged. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS 154, Accounting Changes and
Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion No20 and FASB Statement No3 SFAS 154. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle,
unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the
change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in nondiscretionary profit-sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that
a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long-lived, nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and
corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this Statement is issued. Tumbleweed will
adopt the provisions of SFAS 154 in the first quarter of 2006, beginning January1, 2006. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin 107, Share-Based Payment SAB 107 regarding the SECs interpretation of SFAS 123R. This interpretation expresses the views of the SEC regarding the interaction between SFAS 123R and certain SEC rules and
regulations and provides the SECs views regarding the valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public companies. In particular, SAB 107 provides guidance related to share-based payment transactions with non-employees, the transition
from nonpublic to public entity status, valuation methods, the accounting for certain redeemable financial instruments issued under share-based payment arrangements, the classification of compensation expense, non generally accepted accounting
principles financial measures, first-time adoption of SFAS 123R in an interim period, capitalization of compensation cost related to share-based payment arrangements, the accounting for income tax effects of share-based payment arrangements upon
adoption of SFAS 123R, the modification of employee share options prior to adoption of Statement123R and disclosures in Managements Discussion and Analysis subsequent to adoption of SFAS123R. Tumbleweed will adopt SAB 107 in
connection with its adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006, beginning January1, 2006, which is expected to have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results of operations and earnings per share. FASB Staff Position 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004 FSP109-2, provides guidance under SFAS109, Accounting for Income Taxes, with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Jobs
Act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability. The Jobs Act was enacted in October 2004. FSP 109-2 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of
the Jobs Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS 109. Tumbleweed has adopted FSP109-2 and the adoption did not have any impact on its financial position or results of operations as it
did not apply. 3Business Combinations On March18, 2004, Tumbleweed completed the acquisition of Corvigo, an anti-spam appliance vendor. The acquisition was entered into to strengthen Tumbleweeds position in the anti-spam and email security
markets and to accelerate Tumbleweeds distribution plans through the addition of resellers already selling the Corvigo 
53 Table of Contents TUMBLEWEED COMMUNICATIONS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
appliance. The purchase price of $409 million consisted of an exchange of 4,732,284 shares of Tumbleweeds common stock with a fair value of $328
million based on the fair value of Tumbleweeds common stock on the date of the acquisition, cash paid of $60 million, assumed stock options with a fair value of $13 million, severances for former Corvigo employees of $97,000, and other
acquisition-related costs of $727,000, consisting primarily of legal fees, banking fees, and accounting fees. The following is a summary

Goodwill 33,356 Total 40,947 On March15, 2004, Tumbleweed completed the acquisition of Incubator, a reseller of
Tumbleweeds products. The acquisition was entered into to expand Tumbleweeds sales in Europe. The purchase price of $17 million consisted of an exchange of 224,278 shares of Tumbleweeds common stock with a fair value of $16
million based on the fair value of Tumbleweeds common stock on the date of the acquisition and other acquisition-related costs of $119,000, consisting of legal and accounting fees. The following is a summary of the allocation of the purchase price in the acquisition of Incubator in thousands:  Net tangible liabilities 493 Maintenance agreements 350 Customer base and reseller agreements 450 Goodwill 1,410 Total 1,717 As part of the acquisition of Incubator, Tumbleweed agreed that in the event that a certain sales
goal was met in Tumbleweeds European sales region in the year ending December31, 2004, Tumbleweeds purchase price for Incubator would increase by the exchange of additional shares of Tumbleweeds common stock. During the three
months ended September30, 2004, the purchase agreement was amended to issue 62,509 shares to the former owners of Incubator worth $183,000 based on the fair value of Tumbleweeds stock on the date of issuance as consideration for progress
towards the European sales goal in the first six months of 2004. In addition, in the event that specified sales goals were met in Tumbleweeds European sales region for the two-year period ending December31, 2005, Tumbleweeds
purchase price for Incubator would increase by the exchange of additional shares of Tumbleweeds common stock worth $1,000,000 plus 10% of the amount of Tumbleweeds European sales in excess of the sales goal for the year ending
December31, 2005. The sales goals for the European sales region for the year ending December31, 2004 and the two-year period ending December31, 2005 were not met. As a result of these sales goals not being met, there is no further
contingent purchase price related to the acquisition of Incubator. 
54 Table of Contents TUMBLEWEED COMMUNICATIONS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
On June23, 2003, Tumbleweed acquired Valicert, which develops and licenses secure Internet
communications and identity validation software for file transfer, financial messaging, and business process integration. The merger was entered into to combine the two companies into a single, more competitive industry participant. The acquisition
was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The purchase price of $170
million consisted of an exchange of 9,713,634 shares of Tumbleweeds common stock with a fair value of $130 million based on the average fair value of Tumbleweeds stock two days before and two days after the announcement date of
February18, 2003, assumed stock options with a fair value of $17 million, severances for former Valicert employees of $276,000, and other acquisition-related costs of $20 million, consisting primarily of payments for legal fees, investment
banking fees, financial printing fees, accounting fees, and proxy mailing fees. The following is a summary of the allocation of the
purchase price in the acquisition of Valicert in thousands:  Net tangible liabilities 1,647 Core/developed technology 2,600 Maintenance agreements 700 Customer base and reseller agreements 1,400 Trademarks and tradenames 200 In-process research and development 100 Purchases orders license 300 Goodwill 13,308 Total 16,961 Purchases orders license intangible assets and in-process research and development were written
off in full during 2003. The remaining intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of three to five years. As
of December31, 2005, in connection with the acquisitions of Corvigo, Incubator, and Valicert on March18, 2004,March15, 2004, and June23, 2003, respectively, Tumbleweed has $334 million, $14 million, and $133 million
of goodwill, respectively, representing the excess of the respective purchase prices over the fair values of the acquired net tangible and identified intangible assets. During the last three quarters of 2004, Tumbleweed reduced its goodwill balance
related to the Corvigo acquisition by $14 million to reduce to fair value unvested stock options assumed in the acquisition and increased its goodwill balance related to the Corvigo acquisition by $93,000 due to actual expenditures for accounting
and legal acquisition-related costs being higher than previously estimated. During the second quarter of 2004, Tumbleweed increased its goodwill balance related to the Incubator acquisition by $15,000 due to actual expenditures for accounting and
legal acquisition-related costs being higher than previously estimated. During the last two quarters of 2003, Tumbleweed reduced its goodwill balance related to the Valicert acquisition by $50,000 due to actual expenditures for severance costs for
former Valicert employees and other acquisition-related costs being less than previously estimated. Merger-related and Other Costs
Merger-related and other costs of a net credit of $96,000 for 2005 consist of a $296,000 credit related to the termination of an
operating lease in Slough, United Kingdom partially offset by a $200,000 severance cost associated with the resignation of our former Chief Executive Officer. The combined cost of the final lease settlement payments, commissions, brokerage fees, and
legal fees related to the termination of the Slough lease 
55 Table of Contents TUMBLEWEED COMMUNICATIONS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
was less than the existing accrual for the loss on the lease, resulting in the expense credit. The Slough lease was assumed during the acquisition of
Interface, Inc. in 2000 and covered approximately 13,000 square feet of office space. The lease was for a term ending in 2020 with quarterly rent payments of approximately $65,000. The final lease settlement payment for the Slough lease of
approximately $113,000 was made in July 2005. Merger-related and other costs of $11 million for 2004 consist of $703,000 of severance
costs for Tumbleweed employees terminated in connection with the Corvigo acquisition and the sale of Tumbleweeds offshore development subsidiary in India to a third party in June of 2004, $183,000 related to anticipated losses on an operating
lease in Palo Alto, California, $168,000 related to anticipated losses on an operating lease in Slough, United Kingdom, a credit of $44,000 for a gain on the sale of Tumbleweeds offshore development center subsidiary in India, and $68,000 of
other merger-related costs. The operating lease in Palo Alto was assumed during the acquisition of Corvigo and covers approximately 12,000 square feet of office space. The lease is for a term ending in 2007 with current monthly rent payments of
approximately $22,000. Subsequent to the acquisition of Corvigo, Tumbleweed decided to vacate the Palo Alto facility. The $183,000 charge was recorded due to a revised estimate of the period required to locate and contract with a sublessee and
sublease rates. As a result of the new estimate, the existing accrual for the loss on the lease was found to be insufficient and the remaining balance for that liability was reclassified on the consolidated balance sheet from Accrued liabilities to
Accrued merger-related and other costs to be tracked along with the liability resulting from the revised estimate recorded in the three months ending September30, 2004. This office space was subleased in December 2004 for the remainder of the
lease term with sublease rental income less than Tumbleweeds rent payments due to a weak office rental market in and around Palo Alto. The operating lease in Slough was assumed during the acquisition of Interface, Inc. in 2000 and covered
approximately 13,000 square feet of office space. The lease was for a term ending in 2020 with quarterly rent payments of approximately $65,000. The $168,000 charge was recorded due to a revised estimate of the term of expected subleases on the
building. Tumbleweeds offshore development center subsidiary in India was acquired in the acquisition of Valicert and supported Tumbleweeds engineering, customer support, and consulting functions. This subsidiary was sold to consolidate
Tumbleweeds offshore development in its existing Bulgaria location. The following table describes merger-related and other costs

4Acquired Workforce In September 2003, Tumbleweed issued 86,538 shares of stock to a company to convert certain former contract engineers to employees in its offshore
development center in Bulgaria. Since this acquisition was not considered to be an acquisition of a business, Tumbleweed recorded an acquired workforce intangible asset of $476,000 to recognize the fair value of the stock issued. Tumbleweed
amortized this intangible asset over its estimated useful life of one year. During 2004 and 2003, respectively, Tumbleweed recognized amortization expense of $337,000 and $139,000, respectively relating to the acquired workforce intangible asset.
This intangible asset was amortized in full as of December31, 2004. 5Financial Statement Components A summary of cash and cash equivalents as of December31, 2005 and 2004 is as follows in thousands:  2005

At December31, 2005, Tumbleweed had a loan outstanding with a combined principal and accrued interest balance of approximately
$58,000 to Mr.Cassidy, Tumbleweeds Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Corporate Secretary. The loan was entered into on April2, 2001, and is evidenced by a promissory note with the full principal amount and all accrued
interest due in four years. The loan was made in order to help retain Mr.Cassidy, and was used for purposes other than to purchase Tumbleweed stock. Interest on the loan is at a rate of 7%per annum which Tumbleweed believes to be the
market rate at the time of the loan. In March2006, Mr. Cassidy made a payment to Tumbleweed of approximately $45,000 which was applied against the combined principal and accrued interest balance. Tumbleweed expects the residual combined
principal and accrued interest balance to be paid in full during 2006. Loan to Jeffrey C. Smith At December31, 2005, Tumbleweed had a loan outstanding with a combined principal and accrued interest balance of approximately $7,000 to
Mr.Smith, Tumbleweeds former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The loan was entered into on June7, 2001, and is evidenced by a full recourse promissory note with the full principal amount and all accrued interest due in five
years. The loan was made in order to help retain Mr.Smith, and was used for purposes other than to purchase Tumbleweed stock. The promissory note is secured by shares of Tumbleweeds common stock and stock options to purchase shares of
Tumbleweeds common stock that Tumbleweed issues to Mr.Smith, as well as the proceeds associated with such securities. Interest on the loan is at 
59 Table of Contents TUMBLEWEED COMMUNICATIONS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
a rate of 7%per annum which Tumbleweed believes to be the market rate at the time of the loan. Principal and interest obligations under this loan will
be forgiven ratably over a period of five years beginning on the effective date of the loan. Mr.Smith resigned as a Chief Executive Officer on June30, 2005 and entered into a transition agreement with Tumbleweed. During the transition
term that is equal to two years from the Mr.Smiths resignation date, Mr.Smith continues to participate in the outstanding loan forgiveness program that will terminate with complete forgiveness of the loan during 2006. 
Legal Counsel Gregory C. Smith, a
brother of Jeffrey C. Smith, Tumbleweeds former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is a partner of the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher Flom LLP Skadden Arps, which began providing legal services to
Tumbleweed in July 1998. Total fees paid to Skadden Arps were approximately $315,000, $802,000, and $979,000 in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, for matters relating to Tumbleweeds intellectual property, Tumbleweeds acquisitions of
Corvigo, Incubator, and Valicert, and ongoing general and other litigation matters. Financial Advisement Curtis H. Smith, a brother of Jeffrey C. Smith, is a principal at First Albany Capital First Albany, which provided financial advisement
services to Tumbleweed in 2004 related to the acquisition of Corvigo. Total fees paid to First Albany were approximately $185,000 in 2004. No fees were paid to First Albany during 2005 or 2003. 7Debt Debt at

A valuation allowance against Tumbleweeds net deferred tax assets has been established since it
cannot be concluded that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities will be realized. The valuation allowance of $1178 million at December31, 2004, increased by $27 million to $1205 million at
December31, 2005. Included in the December31, 2005 valuation allowance is approximately $205 million related to the exercise of stock options, which will be credited to stockholders equity when realized for tax purposes.
In connection with the acquisitions of Corvigo in 2004 and Valicert in 2003, deferred tax assets of approximately $16 million and $335
million, respectively, were recorded. When recognized, the tax benefits of such deferred tax assets will be applied, first, to reduce to zero any goodwill related to this acquisition; second, to reduce to zero other non-current intangible assets
related to this acquisition; and third, to reduce income tax expense. As of December31, 2005, Tumbleweed had net operating loss
carryforwards for Federal and California income tax purposes of approximately $2991 million and $897 million, respectively, available to reduce future income subject to income taxes. The federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire in the
years 2007 through 2025 and the California net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2006 through 2015. As of December31,
2005, Tumbleweed also had research and development tax credit carryforwards for Federal and California income tax return purposes of approximately $49 million and $46 million, respectively, available to reduce future income taxes. Tumbleweed also
has California Manufacturing Credit carryforwards of $262,000. The Federal research and development tax credit will expire in years 2007 through 2025. The California research and development tax credit carries forward indefinitely. Tumbleweeds ability to utilize the net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in the future may be subject to substantial restriction in the
event of past or future ownership changes as defined in Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state tax law. 9Stockholders Equity Under Tumbleweeds certificate of incorporation, Tumbleweed is

shares of common stock is reserved for issuance under the Valicert stock option plans. Valicert stock option plans assumed by Tumbleweed

2001 Non-Statutory Stock Plan, the 1998 Stock Option Plan and the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan, were amended, including the forms of option agreements under each such plan, to conform the terms and conditions applicable to options granted under such
plans to the terms and conditions applicable to options granted under Tumbleweeds 1999 Omnibus Incentive Plan, including the form of option agreement under such plan. In addition to conforming the terms of the Valicert stock option plans assumed by Tumbleweed to Tumbleweeds stock option plan, the 1998 Stock

shares of Valicert common stock; and  the provision of the 1998 Stock Option Plan that provides for a 5% annual increase in the number of stock options available for grant under such plan shall be calculated as a
percentage of the number of Tumbleweed shares issued and outstanding rather than the number of Valicert shares issued and outstanding. Corvigo Stock Option Plan On March18, 2004, Tumbleweed assumed the Corvigo 2002 Stock Option

Repurchase Program In August 2002, Tumbleweeds Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase up to $100 million of its
common stock. During the year ended December31, 2002, Tumbleweed repurchased 717,500 shares of its common stock for $796,000. Tumbleweed did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during 2003. The repurchase program was terminated in
August 2003. 10Employee Benefit Plan Tumbleweed has a 401k plan that allows eligible employees to contribute a percentage of their compensation, limited to $14,000 $18,000 for employees over age 50, $13,000 $16,000 for employees over age50,
and $12,000 in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Tumbleweed did not match contributions to employees 401k plans in 2005, 2004, or 2003. 11Commitments and Contingencies Lease Commitments Tumbleweed leases its facilities and certain equipment under operating lease agreements. The facilities leases expire at various dates through 2008. In
June 1999, Tumbleweed entered into an operating lease covering approximately 40,000 square feet of office space in Redwood City, California and renewed that lease in 2003. The renewed lease expires in July 2008 with current monthly rent payments of
approximately $73,000. As a result of the Corvigo acquisition, Tumbleweed assumed an operating lease in Palo Alto, California. Subsequent
to the acquisition of Corvigo, Tumbleweed decided to vacate the Palo Alto facility. The lease is for a term ending in 2007 with current monthly rent payments of approximately $22,000. Anticipated future sublease rental income is expected to be less
than the rent expense due to a weak office rental market in and around Palo Alto. In 2004 Tumbleweed recognized a charge of $183,000 related to anticipated losses on this lease that was included in the consolidated statement of operations as
Merger-related and other costs. The $183,000 charge was recorded due to a revised estimate of the period required to locate and contract with a sublessee and sublease rates. As a result of the new estimate, the existing accrual for the loss on the
lease was found to be insufficient and the remaining balance for that liability was reclassified on the consolidated balance sheet from Accrued liabilities to Accrued merger-related and other costs to be tracked along with the liability resulting
from the 
66 Table of Contents TUMBLEWEED COMMUNICATIONS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
revised estimate recorded in the three months ending September30, 2004. This office space was subleased in December 2004 for the remainder of the lease
term with sublease rental income less than Tumbleweeds rent payments due to a weak office rental market in and around Palo Alto. Future minimum lease payments for operating leases as of December31, 2005, are as follows in thousands:  Year Ending December31 OperatingLeases
2006 1,715
2007 1,258
2008 523 Future minimum lease payments 3,496 The amounts above will be offset by sublease receipts of $244,000 in 2006 and $20,000 in 2007.
Total rent expense under operating leases for 2005, 2004, and 2003, was $15 million, $14 million, and $18million, respectively.
Contingencies In
December 2001, certain plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of purchasers of the common stock of Valicert, alleging violations of federal securities laws. In
re Valicert, Inc. Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation, No01-CV-10889 SAS S.D.N.Y., related to In re Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation, No21 MC 92 SAS. The operative amended complaint is brought on
purported behalf of all persons who purchased Valicert common stock from the date of its July27, 2000 initial public offering IPO through December6, 2000. It names as defendants Valicert, its former Chief Executive Officer,
its Chief Financial Officer the Valicert Defendants, as well as an investment banking firm that served as an underwriter for the IPO. The complaint alleges liability under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections
10b and 20a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on the grounds that the registration statement for the IPO did not disclose that: 1the underwriter agreed to allow certain customers to purchase shares in the IPO in exchange for excess
commissions to be paid to the underwriter; and 2the underwriter arranged for certain customers to purchase additional shares in the aftermarket at predetermined prices. The complaint also appears to allege that false or misleading analyst
reports were issued. The complaint does not claim any specific amount of damages. Similar allegations have been made in lawsuits relating to more than 300 other initial public offerings conducted in 1999 and 2000, all of which have been consolidated
for pretrial purposes. In February 2003, the Court issued a ruling on all defendants motions to dismiss, denying Valicerts motion to dismiss the claims under the Securities Act of 1933, but granting Valicerts motion to dismiss the
claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In June 2003, Valicert accepted a settlement proposal presented to all issuer defendants
in this case. Under the proposed settlement, the plaintiffs will dismiss and release all claims against the Valicert Defendants in exchange for a contingent payment guaranty by the insurance companies collectively responsible for insuring the
issuers in all the consolidated cases, and the assignment or surrender of control to the plaintiffs of certain claims the issuer defendants may have against the underwriters. Under the guaranty, the insurers will be required to pay the amount, if
any, by which $1 billion exceeds the aggregate amount ultimately collected by the plaintiffs from the underwriter defendants in all of the cases. If the plaintiffs fail to recover $1 billion and payment is required under the guaranty, Valicert would
be responsible to pay its pro rata portion of the shortfall, up to the amount of the deductible retention under its insurance policy, which is $500,000. The timing and amount of payments that Valicert could be required to make under the proposed
settlement will depend on several factors, principally the 
67 Table of Contents TUMBLEWEED COMMUNICATIONS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
timing and amount of any payment required by the insurers pursuant to the $1 billion guaranty. The proposed settlement is subject to approval of the Court,
which cannot be assured. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include a reserve for any potential loss, as Tumbleweed does not consider a loss to be probable at this time. In June 2003, Tumbleweed was served with a summons and first amended complaint, captioned Liu v. Credit Suisse First Boston, et alia, alleging the
violation of federal and state securities laws, purportedly on behalf of persons who acquired the common stock of Tumbleweed other than purchasers of Tumbleweeds IPO from August6, 1999 to October18, 2000. The case was transferred
to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, where in March 2005, the Court dismissed the case with prejudice. In June 2005 plaintiffs filed an appeal of the dismissal with the United States Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit, which remains pending. An adverse outcome in this case could harm Tumbleweeds business and operating results. Moreover, the costs in defending this lawsuit could harm future operating results. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements do not include a reserve for any potential loss, as Tumbleweed does not consider a loss to be probable at this time. All costs incurred as a result of these legal proceedings and claims are charged to expense as incurred. Tumbleweed indemnifies its customers from third party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to the use of its products.
Historically, costs related to these guarantees have not been significant. Tumbleweed is unable to estimate the potential impact of these guarantees on its future results of operations. 12Segment Information As defined by SFAS 131, Disclosure About Segments

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period,
our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act and are effective in
ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  b
Changes in internal controls over financial reporting. During 2005, we transitioned to a new financial system to be used for our general ledger accounting. This system is designed to enhance our financial reporting by providing more timely and accurate financial and accounting information, and
by eliminating the need to transfer financial data from one financial system to another. Other than the change mentioned above, no other
changes in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act occurred during 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not
expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all
control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Tumbleweed have been detected. Our controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of
achieving their objectives and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level.  c
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission, or COSO, in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Our management has concluded that, as of December31, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria. Our independent registered
public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, have issued an audit report on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
