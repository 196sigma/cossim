Management Report on Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control    
The management of CovanceInc. Covance has prepared, and is responsible for, Covance consolidated financial statements
and related footnotes. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
Covance
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. The purpose of this system of internal accounting controls over financial reporting is to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that transactions are executed
in accordance with management authorization and are properly recorded, and that accounting records may be relied upon for the preparation of accurate and complete consolidated financial statements.
The design, monitoring and revision of internal accounting control systems involve, among other things, management judgment with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of specific
control measures. Covance also maintains an internal audit function that evaluates and reports on the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls, policies and procedures. 
Covance
management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013 was effective and adequate to accomplish the objectives described above.
Management assessment was based upon the criteria in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 1992
framework. Covance consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of control over financial reporting have been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst
YoungLLP, as stated in their reports which are included elsewhere herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    
The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
CovanceInc. 
We
have audited CovanceInc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 1992 framework the COSO criteria. CovanceInc. and subsidiaries'
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the
accompanying report on consolidated financial statements and internal control.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In
our opinion, CovanceInc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013, based on
the COSO criteria. 
We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of CovanceInc. and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December31, 2013 and our report dated February27, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    
The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
CovanceInc. 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CovanceInc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of
income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of CovanceInc. and subsidiaries at
December31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2013 in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, CovanceInc. and subsidiaries' internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission 1992 framework, and our report dated February27, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

COVANCEINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012 AND 2011 Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise indicated   1.Organization  CovanceInc. and its subsidiaries Covance or the Company is a leading drug development services company providing a wide range of early-stage
and late-stage product
development services on a worldwide basis primarily to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Covance also provides services such as laboratory testing to the chemical, agrochemical and food
industries. Covance operations constitute two segments for financial reporting purposes. The first segment, early development services, includes discovery support services, preclinical and clinical
pharmacology service offerings. The second segment, late-stage development services, includes central laboratory, PhaseII-IV clinical development and market access services. Operations are
principally focused in the United States and Europe. 
2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Principles of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities controlled by Covance. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions are eliminated. The equity method of accounting is used for investments in affiliates in which Covance owns between 20 and 50percent and does not have the ability to
exercise control. For investments in which Covance owns less than 20percent and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating or financial decisions of the
investee, the cost method of accounting is applied. Where the fair value of the shares of the cost method investee is based on quoted prices in active markets, Covance accounts for such investment as
available-for-sale securities. See Note5.  Use of Estimates  These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP,
which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from these estimates.  Foreign Currencies  For subsidiaries outside of the United States that operate in a local currency environment, income and expense items are translated to
United States dollars at the monthly average rates of exchange prevailing during the year, assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates and equity accounts are translated at
historical exchange rates. Translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets and are included in the determination of
comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of stockholders' equity. Transaction gains and losses are included in the determination of net
income in the consolidated statements of income.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at date of purchase
and consist principally of amounts invested in money market funds and bank deposits.  Short-Term Investments  Short-term investments consist of bank term deposits, denominated in Swiss Francs, which mature in August 2014. 44

2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued  Financial Instruments  The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses
approximate their carrying amounts as reported at December31, 2013 and 2012. 
Accounts
receivable and unbilled services represent amounts due from Covance customers who are concentrated primarily in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Covance
endeavors to monitor the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the ordinary course of business. Although Covance customers are concentrated primarily within these two
industries, management considers the likelihood of material credit risk as remote. In addition, in some cases Covance requires advance payment for a portion of the contract price from its customers
upon the signing of a contract for services. These amounts are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are performed. Historically, bad debts have been immaterial. The allowance for doubtful
accounts is $61million and $62million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  Inventory  Inventories, which consist principally of finished goods and supplies, are valued at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or
market. Finished goods accounted for $303million and $327million and supplies accounted for $180million and $166million of total inventory at December31,
2013 and 2012, respectively.  Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets  In connection with the management of multi-site clinical trials, Covance pays on behalf of its customers fees to investigators,
volunteers and other out-of-pocket costs such as travel, printing, meetings, couriers, etc., for which the Company is reimbursed at cost, without mark-up or profit. Amounts receivable from customers
in connection with billed and unbilled investigator fees, volunteer payments and other out-of-pocket pass-through costs are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets and totaled $889million and $820million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. See Note2 Reimbursable Out-of-Pocket Expenses. 
Also
included in prepaid expenses and other current assets are assets held for sale. Covance records long-lived assets as held for sale when a plan to sell the asset has been initiated
and all other held for sale criteria have been satisfied. Assets classified as held for sale are recorded in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of their carrying value
or fair value less cost to sell. During the fourth quarter of 2013, Covance entered into negotiations to sell certain assets of its Genomics Laboratory located in Seattle, Washington. As a result 67million of associated net assets were reclassified to assets held for sale as of December31, 2013. During the first quarter of 2013, Covance completed the closure of its clinical
pharmacology facility in Basel, Switzerland and initiated actions to sell that property. As a result, the $83million carrying value of the property was reclassified from property and
equipment to assets held for sale as of March31, 2013. During the fourth quarter of 2013, Covance recorded an impairment charge of $23million to reduce the carrying value of the Basel
property to its estimated fair market value less cost to sell as of December31, 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2011, Covance completed the wind-down and transition of services at its
toxicology facility in Vienna, Virginia and initiated actions to sell that property. As a result, the related carrying value of $270million was reclassified from property and equipment to
assets held for sale as of December31, 2011. See Note12.

2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method at rates adequate
to allocate the cost of the applicable assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from ten to forty years for buildings and improvements, three to ten years for equipment,
furniture and fixtures and three to five years for computer hardware and software, except for certain large enterprise-wide software applications which are depreciated over periods of up to ten years.
Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the associated remaining lease term. The cost of
computer software developed or obtained for internal use is capitalized and amortized on the straight-line
method over the estimated useful life. Costs incurred during the development phase are capitalized, while all other costs are expensed as incurred. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Covance reviews its long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based upon Covance judgment of its ability to
recover the value of the asset from the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related operations or the sale of the asset. Actual future cash flows may be greater or less than estimated.
During the fourth quarter of 2013, Covance determined that the carrying value of its Manassas, Virginia and Basel, Switzerland properties, both included in the early development segment, was no longer
fully recoverable from the cash flows expected from their sale, based upon changes in the respective real estate markets, coupled with changes in the respective marketing plans. As such, Covance
recorded an asset impairment charge of $26million and $23million, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair values as of December31,
2013. See Note3 and Note12, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2011, Covance determined that the carrying value of its equity method investment in a supplier of research
products was no longer fully recoverable based upon changes in the research product market. The impairment was determined to be other-than-temporary and Covance recorded a charge of
$121million to reduce the carrying value of the equity investment to its estimated fair value as of December31, 2011. Further, during the second quarter of 2012, the equity investment
was determined to have experienced an additional impairment in value due to a further decline in demand for the research products from this supplier. As a result, Covance recorded a
$74million impairment charge to write off the remaining carrying value of the equity investment as of June30, 2012. See Note5.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Impairment  Goodwill represents costs in excess of the fair value of net tangible and identifiable net intangible assets acquired in business
combinations. Covance performs an annual test for impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter. Covance tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting
unit level only when, after completing a qualitative analysis, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. This test is
performed by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value. Covance assesses fair value based upon its estimate of the present value of the future cash flows that it expects to
be generated by the reporting unit. In the second quarter of 2012, Covance commenced actions to close its clinical pharmacology operations located in Basel,

Switzerland
and as a result determined the goodwill associated with the acquisition of the Basel clinic was impaired and recorded a charge of $180million to write off the carrying value of
the goodwill as of June30, 2012. The Basel clinic is part of Covance early development segment and clinical pharmacology reporting unit, however, because the clinic was operated on a
standalone basis and was not integrated into the reporting unit after its acquisition, the related goodwill was evaluated for impairment at the site level and not the reporting unit level. The annual
test for impairment performed for 2013, 2012 and 2011 indicated that no reporting units were at significant risk for impairment. See Note4. 
Intangible
assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range in term from one to ten years. Land use rights are amortized on
a straight-line basis over their contractual life of fifty years. The Company periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the estimated useful lives of these intangible assets. See Note4.  Revenue Recognition  Covance recognizes revenue either as services are performed or products are delivered, depending on the nature of the work contracted.
Historically, a majority of Covance net revenues have been earned under contracts which range in duration from a few months to two years, but can extend in duration up to five years or longer.
Covance also has committed minimum volume arrangements with certain clients with initial terms that generally range in duration from three to ten years. Underlying these arrangements are individual
project contracts for the specific services to be provided. These arrangements enable our clients to secure our services in exchange for which they commit to purchase an annual minimum dollar value
volume of services. Under these types of arrangements, if the annual minimum volume commitment is not reached, the client is required to pay Covance for the shortfall. Progress towards the
achievement of annual minimum volume commitments is monitored throughout the year. Annual minimum commitment shortfalls are not included in net revenues until the amount has been determined and agreed
to by the client. 
Service
contracts generally take the form of fee-for-service or fixed-price arrangements. In cases where performance spans multiple accounting periods, revenue is recognized as services
are performed, measured on a proportional-performance basis, generally using output measures that are specific to the service provided. Examples of output measures in our early development segment
include the number of slides read, dosings performed, or specimens prepared for preclinical laboratory services, or number of dosings or number of volunteers enrolled for clinical pharmacology.
Examples of output measures in our late-stage development segment PhaseII-IV clinical development service offering include among others, number of investigators enrolled, number of sites
initiated, number of patients enrolled and number of monitoring visits completed. Revenue is determined by dividing the actual units of work completed by the total units of work required under the
contract and multiplying that percentage by the total contract value. The total contract value, or total contractual payments, represents the aggregate contracted price for each of the agreed upon
services to be provided. Covance does not have any contractual arrangements spanning
multiple accounting periods where revenue is recognized on a proportional-performance basis under which the Company has earned more than an immaterial amount of performance-based revenue
i.e.,potential additional revenue tied to specific deliverables or performance. Changes in the scope of work are common, especially under long-term contracts, and generally result in a
change in contract value. Once the client has agreed to the changes in scope and renegotiated pricing terms, the contract value is amended and revenue is recognized, as described above. Estimates of
costs to complete are made to provide, where appropriate, for losses expected on contracts. Costs are not deferred in anticipation of contracts being awarded, but instead are expensed as incurred.

2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
Billing
schedules and payment terms are generally negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. In some cases, Covance bills the client for the total contract value in progress-based
installments as certain non-contingent billing milestones are reached over the contract duration, such as, but not limited to, contract signing, initial dosing, investigator site initiation, patient
enrollment or database lock. The term billing milestone relates only to a billing trigger in a contract whereby amounts become billable and payable in accordance with a negotiated predetermined
billing schedule throughout the term of a project. These billing milestones are not performance-based i.e.,potential additional arrangement consideration tied to specific deliverables or
performance. In other cases, billing and payment terms are tied to the passage of time e.g.,monthly billings. In either case, the total contract value and aggregate amounts billed to the
client would be the same at the end of the project. While Covance attempts to negotiate terms that provide for billing and payment of services prior or within close proximity to the provision of
services, this is not always the case, as evidenced by fluctuations in the levels of unbilled services and unearned revenue from period to period. While a project is ongoing, cash payments are not
necessarily representative of aggregate revenue earned at any particular point in time, as revenues are recognized when services are provided, while amounts billed and paid are in accordance with the
negotiated billing and payment terms. 
In
some cases, payments received are in excess of revenue recognized. For example, a contract invoicing schedule may provide for an upfront payment of 10% of the full contract value
upon contract signing, but at the time of signing, performance of services has not yet begun, and therefore, no revenue has yet been recognized. Payments received in advance of services being
provided, such as in this example, are deferred as unearned revenue on the balance sheet. As the contracted services are subsequently performed and the associated revenue is recognized, the unearned
revenue balance is reduced by the amount of revenue recognized during the period. 
In
other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the client is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed, and the difference,
representing an unbilled receivable, is recorded for this amount which is currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms. Once the client is invoiced, the unbilled services are
reduced for the amount billed, and a corresponding account receivable is recorded. All unbilled services are billable to customers within one year from the respective balance sheet date. 
Most
contracts are terminable by the client, either immediately or upon notice. These contracts often require payment to Covance of expenses to wind down the study or project, fees
earned to date and, in some cases, a termination fee or a payment to Covance of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned by Covance under the contract if it had not been
terminated early. Termination fees are included in net revenues when realization is assured. In connection with the management of multi-site clinical trials, Covance pays on behalf of its customers
fees to investigators, volunteers and other out-of-pocket costs such as for travel, printing, meetings, couriers, etc., for which it is reimbursed at cost, without mark-up or profit. Investigator
fees are not reflected in total revenues or expenses where Covance acts in the capacity of an agent on behalf of the pharmaceutical company sponsor, passing through these costs without risk or reward
to Covance. All other out-of-pocket costs are included in total revenues and expenses.

2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued  Costs and Expenses  Cost of revenue includes direct labor and related benefit charges, other direct costs, shipping and handling fees, and an allocation
of facility charges and information technology costs and excludes depreciation and amortization. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of administrative payroll and related
benefit charges, advertising and promotional expenses, administrative travel and an allocation of facility charges and information technology costs and excludes depreciation and amortization. Cost of
advertising is expensed as incurred.  Taxes  Covance uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year
in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in enacted tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is effective. See
Note6. 
The
Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if the Company believes it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical
merits of the position. The amount of the accrual for which an exposure exists is measured as the largest amount of benefit determined on a cumulative probability basis that the Company believes is
more likely than not to be realized upon
ultimate settlement of the position. Components of the reserve are classified as either a current or long-term liability in the consolidated balance sheet based on when the Company expects each of the
items to be settled. Covance accrues interest and penalties in relation to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The
Company also maintains a tax reserve related to exposures for non-income tax matters, including value-added tax, state sales and use and other taxes. The balance of this reserve was
$11million at both December31, 2013 and 2012, and is recorded as a current liability in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. 
While
Covance believes it has identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and the reserve it has established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstances, it
is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures may be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved. It is also possible that changes in facts and circumstances could cause
Covance to either materially increase or reduce the carrying amount of its tax reserve. 
Covance
historical policy has been to leave its unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the United States. Covance intends to continue to leave its unremitted
foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the United States. As a result, taxes have not been provided on any of the remaining accumulated foreign unremitted earnings as of December31,
2013. See Note6.

2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company sponsors several stock-based compensation plans pursuant to which non-qualified stock options and restricted stock awards
are granted to eligible employees. These plans are described more fully in Note9. The grant-date fair value of awards expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period of the related awards.  Defined Benefit Pension Plans  Covance sponsors various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans which are more fully described in Note8. The
measurement of the related benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs recorded each year are based upon actuarial computations, which require
management judgment as to certain assumptions. These assumptions include the discount rates to use in computing the present value of the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs, the
expected future rate of salary increases for pay-related plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for funded plans. The discount rates are derived based on a hypothetical
yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on the target asset allocation and the average expected rate
of growth for the asset classes invested. The average expected rate of growth is derived from a combination of historic returns, current market indicators, the expected risk premium for each asset
class and the opinion of professional advisors. Liabilities related to all of Covance pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are measured as of December31. In
the third quarter of 2012, the Company remeasured its German defined benefit pension plan liability due to a reduction in plan participants resulting from cost reduction actions
taken at its Muenster, Germany toxicology facility. The measurement resulted in a $54million net increase to the liability, which reflects a $61million actuarial loss, partially
offset by a curtailment gain of $07million. These adjustments were recognized in the 2012 period as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax of $19million
and $02million, respectively. See Note8.  Earnings Per Share EPS  Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the period. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have
been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued; computed under the treasury stock method. 
In
computing diluted EPS for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the denominator was increased by 2,250,480 shares, 1,445,369 shares and 1,461,566 shares,
respectively, representing the dilutive effect of all unvested restricted shares as well as those stock options outstanding at December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, with exercise prices less than
the average market price of Covance common stock during each respective period. Excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for the year ended December31, 2013 were options to purchase
205,001 shares of common stock at prices ranging from $7790 to $9434 per share because the exercise prices of such options were greater than the average market price of Covance common stock during
2013. Excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for the year ended December31, 2012 were options to purchase 2,337,264 shares of common stock at prices ranging from $4920 to $9434 per
share

investigators, volunteers and other out-of-pocket costs for which the Company is reimbursed at cost, without mark-up or profit. Amounts paid to volunteers and other out-of-pocket costs are reflected
in operating expenses, while the reimbursements received are reflected in revenues in the consolidated statements of income. Covance excludes from revenue and expense in the consolidated statements of
income fees paid to investigators and the associated reimbursement since Covance acts as an agent on behalf of the pharmaceutical company sponsors with regard to investigator payments.  Supplemental Cash Flow Information  Cash paid for interest for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 totaled $46million, $46million
and $38million, respectively. Cash paid for income taxes for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 totaled $193million, $298million and
$582million, respectively. The change in income taxes payable in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 includes as an operating
cash outflow the excess tax benefit received from the exercise of non-qualified stock options of $61million, $11million and $09million, respectively a corresponding cash
inflow of $61million, $11million and $09million, respectively, has been included in financing cash flows.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  In March 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2013-05, Foreign Currency Matters Topic 830: Parent Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a
Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity ASU 2013-05. ASU 2013-05 clarifies the applicable guidance under current U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles for the release of the cumulative translation adjustment upon a reporting entity derecognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity or part or all of its investment
in a foreign entity. The ASU requires a reporting entity, which either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or
group of assets within a foreign entity, to release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income. ASU 2013-05 is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2013. Covance will be required to adopt ASU 2013-05 no later than the quarter beginning
January1, 2014. Although Covance does not expect the adoption of the ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial position, the actual impact will be
dependent upon the nature and significance of future events that would be subject to the ASU.

During
the fourth quarter of 2013, Covance determined that the carrying value of its Manassas, Virginia land, which is included in the early development segment, was no longer fully
recoverable from the sale of the property based upon changes in the local real estate market and the related marketing plan for the property. Covance recorded an asset impairment charge of
$26million to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value less cost to sell as of December31, 2013. 
During
the fourth quarter of 2013, Covance entered into negotiations to sell certain assets of its Genomics Laboratory located in Seattle, Washington. As a result, $44million
was reclassified from property and equipment to assets held for sale in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2013. See Note12. During
the first quarter of 2013, Covance completed the closure of its clinical pharmacology site in Basel, Switzerland and initiated actions to sell that property. As a result, the
$83million carrying value of the property was reclassified from property and equipment to assets held for sale in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of March31,

5.Equity Investments  In March 2013, Covance sold its entire investment in BioClinica,Inc. BIOC for cash proceeds of $171million. The cost basis in the
investment was
$14million, resulting in a realized gain on the sale of approximately $157million. The carrying value of Covance investment in BIOC as of December31, 2012 was
$135million, as determined based on quoted prices in an active market. The investment was reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The $36million increase in the
carrying value prior to the date of sale resulted in a $28million increase in the unrealized gain on investment, net of tax. The
unrealized gain on the investment at December31, 2012 was $121million, or $74million, net of tax, and was included within accumulated other comprehensive income on the
consolidated balance sheet. 
On
January31, 2013, Covance terminated its long-standing inventory supply agreement with Noveprim Limited Noveprim and surrendered its entire 47% minority equity position in
Noveprim. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the investment was determined to have experienced an other-than-temporary impairment in value due to a decline in demand for the research products supplied
by Noveprim. As a result, Covance recorded a $121million impairment charge against the goodwill recognized upon the initial investment in Noveprim, to reduce the carrying value of the
investment to its estimated fair value. Further, during the second quarter of 2012, the investment was determined to have experienced an additional impairment in value due to a further decline in
demand for the research products supplied by Noveprim. As a result, Covance recorded a $74million impairment charge to write off the remaining carrying value of the investment as of
June30, 2012, and suspended equity accounting for this investment as the carrying value was zero. The fair value in both of the above instances was measured with an income approach using
internally developed estimates of future cash flows, which are Level3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy. During the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, Covance recognized income
of $17thousand and $05million, respectively, representing its share of Noveprim earnings. 
In
July 2012, Covance sold 100% of its investment in Caprion Proteomics Caprion, a privately held company headquartered in Montreal, Canada, for cash proceeds of approximately
$47million and recognized a gain on the sale of approximately $15million. In June 2013, Covance received an additional $07million in contingent consideration in connection
with the Caprion sale, upon the release of funds held in escrow, which was recorded as an additional gain on the sale.

The
effective tax rate for the year ended December31, 2013, includes a benefit of $30million relating to UK RD tax credits during the first three months of 2013,
whereas the effective tax rate for the year ended December31, 2012 includes a benefit of $100million. The decrease in the benefit results from the shift of UK RD tax credits to above
margin treatment, as reflected primarily within the impact of international operations line above. Previously
unrecognized tax benefits consist primarily of tax benefits recorded in connection with the favorable resolution of income tax audits and tax benefits resulting from tax
positions taken in returns filed in each respective year.

As
of December31, 2013, Covance has United States and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $1054million. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of
$1045million have no expiration, while the United States net operating loss carryforwards of $09million will expire in the year 2032. As of December31, 2013, the Company also
has United States foreign tax credit carryforwards of $21million, of which approximately $08million will expire in 2022 with the remaining $13million expiring in 2023. It is
expected that all net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards will be realized, accordingly, no valuation allowance has been provided. 
Covance
currently provides income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries to the extent those earnings are taxable or are expected to be remitted. Covance historical policy has
been to leave its unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the United States. Covance intends to continue to leave its unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the
United States. It is not practical to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable if such accumulated earnings were remitted. Additionally, if such accumulated earnings were remitted,
certain countries impose withholding taxes that, subject to certain limitations, are available for use as a tax credit against any Federal income tax liability arising from such remittance. As a
result, taxes have not been provided on accumulated foreign unremitted earnings totaling approximately $926million at December31, 2013.

6.Taxes on Income Continued 
The
Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if the Company believes it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical
merits of the position. The amount of the accrual for which an exposure exists is measured as the largest amount of benefit determined on a cumulative probability basis that the Company believes is
more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the position. Components of the reserve are classified as either a current or long-term liability in the consolidated balance sheet
based on when the Company expects each of the items to be settled. Covance accrues interest and penalties in relation to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. 
As
of December31, 2013 and 2012, the balance of the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits was $90million and $94million, respectively, which is recorded as a
long-term liability in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Included in the balance of the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits at both December31, 2013 and 2012 is accrued
interest of $06million. This reserve relates to exposures for income
tax matters such as transfer pricing, nexus and deemed income. During the year ended December31, 2013, the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $04million, as the
release of reserves primarily associated with the settlement of income tax audits and the lapsing of the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions more than offset the accrual of additional
reserves relating primarily to transfer pricing and the accrual of interest on existing reserves. Following
is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding accrued interest, for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011: 
dollars in millions Unrecognized tax benefits as of December31, 2010 140 Additions related to tax positions in the current year 30 Reductions due to settlements and payments 19 Reductions due to statute expiration 03  Unrecognized tax benefits as of December31, 2011 148 Additions related to tax positions in the current year 22 Reductions due to settlements and payments 79 Reductions due to statute expiration 03  Unrecognized tax benefits as of December31, 2012 88 Additions related to tax positions in the current year 20 Reductions due to settlements and payments 13 Reductions due to statute expiration 11  Unrecognized tax benefits as of December31, 2013 84   
Any
future changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, resulting from the recognition of tax benefits, would impact the effective tax rate. Over the next twelve months, it
is reasonably possible that the uncertainty surrounding up to $03million, including accrued interest, of the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing will be resolved
as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations or the conclusion of various federal, state and foreign tax audits.

amount of $250million pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement the Note Purchase Agreement dated October2, 2013. The Senior Notes were issued in four series and are reflected in
long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2013:

Interest
on the Senior Notes is payable semiannually on May15thand November15thof each year. The Senior Notes rank equally
with all outstanding indebtedness. Costs associated with the Note Purchase Agreement, which consisted primarily of bank and legal fees totaling $09million, are being amortized ratably over
the terms of the Senior Notes. The proceeds were used to pay down existing indebtedness. The
Note Purchase Agreement contains various financial and other covenants and is guaranteed by certain of Covance domestic subsidiaries and secured by a pledge of 65percent
of the capital stock of certain of
Covance foreign subsidiaries. At December31, 2013, Covance was in compliance with the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement.  Credit Facilities  On March7, 2012, Covance amended its credit facility, which was not due to expire until October 2015, in order to, in part,
provide sufficient liquidity to finance purchases under its 2012 authorized share repurchase program 2012 Repurchase Program. The amended credit agreement the Credit Agreement provides for a
revolving credit facility of up to $500million. At December31, 2013, there were no outstanding borrowings and $29million of outstanding letters of credit under the Credit
Agreement. The proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes were used to pay down outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Agreement. At December31, 2012, there were $3200million
of outstanding borrowings and $29million of outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Agreement. Interest on all outstanding borrowings under the Credit

varies in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and is presently based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin of 125 basis points. Interest on all outstanding
borrowings under the previous credit agreement was based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin of 200 basis points. Interest on outstanding borrowings approximated 146% per annum
during 2013 and 156% per annum during 2012. Costs associated with the Credit Agreement, which expires in March 2017, consisted primarily of bank and legal fees totaling $19million and are
being amortized over the five-year term. 
The
Company pays a commitment fee of 175 basis points on the undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement, and had paid a commitment fee of 30 basis
points on the undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility under the previous credit agreement. Commitment fees totaled approximately $03million and $04million during the years
ended December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Credit Agreement contains various financial and other covenants and is collateralized by guarantees of certain of Covance domestic
subsidiaries and a pledge of 65percent of the capital stock of certain of Covance foreign subsidiaries. At December31, 2013, Covance was in compliance with the terms of the Credit
Agreement. 
8.Employee Benefit Plans  Covance sponsors various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. All plans have a measurement date of December31.  Defined Benefit Pension Plans  Covance sponsors two defined benefit pension plans for the benefit of its employees at two United Kingdom subsidiaries and one defined
benefit pension plan for the benefit of its employees at a German subsidiary, all of which are legacy plans of previously acquired companies. Benefit amounts for all three plans are based upon years
of service and compensation. The German plan is unfunded while the United Kingdom pension plans are funded. Covance funding policy has been to contribute annually a fixed percentage of the eligible
employee salary at least equal to the local statutory funding requirements. The
components of net periodic pension cost for these plans for 2013, 2012 and 2011 are as follows:

The
accumulated benefit obligation for the United Kingdom pension plans was $1729million and $1564million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The
accumulated benefit obligation for the German plan was $173million and $152million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The

The
net actuarial loss for the United Kingdom and German pension plans required to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost in 2014 is
expected to be $14million and $02million, respectively. 
The
investment policies for the United Kingdom pension plans are set by the plan trustees, based upon the guidance of professional advisors and after consultation with the Company,
taking into consideration the plans' liabilities and future funding levels. The trustees have set the long-term investment policy largely in accordance with the asset allocation of a broadly
diversified investment portfolio. Assets are generally invested within the target ranges as follows:

Investments
are made in pooled investment funds. Pooled investment fund managers are regulated by the Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom and operate under terms which
contain restrictions on the way in which the portfolios are managed and require the managers to ensure that suitable internal operating procedures are in place. The trustees have set performance
objectives for each fund manager and routinely monitor and assess the managers' performance against such objectives. Annuities represent annuity buy-in insurance policies purchased by the plan
trustees from large, financially sound insurers. The cash flows from the annuities are intended to match the plan obligations to specific groups of participants, typically those participants
currently receiving benefits.

funds represent pooled investment vehicles offered by investment managers, which are generally comprised of investments in equities, bonds, property
and cash. The plans' trustees hold units in these funds, the value of which is determined by the number of units held multiplied by the unit price calculated by the investment managers. That unit
price is derived based on the market value of the securities that comprise the fund, which are determined by quoted prices in active markets. No element of the valuation is based on inputs made by the
plans' trustees.
bAnnuities
represent annuity buy-in insurance policies, whereby the insurer pays the pension payments for the lifetime of the members covered. The annuities
are assets of the plan and payments from the insurer are made to the plans' trustees, who than use those proceeds to pay the pensioners. The cash flows from the annuities are intended to effectively
match the payments to the pensioners covered by the policy. As such, these assets are valued actuarially based upon the value of the liabilities with which they are associated. As the valuation of
these assets is judgmental, and there are no observable inputs associated with the valuation, these assets are classified as Level3 in the fair value hierarchy.

Series Preferred Stock. The Covance Board of Directors has the authority to issue such shares from time to time, without stockholder approval, and to determine the designations, preferences, rights,
including voting rights, and restrictions of such shares, subject to the Delaware General Corporate Laws. Pursuant to this authority, the Covance Board of Directors has designated 10million
shares of the Covance Series Preferred Stock as Covance SeriesA Preferred Stock. No other class of Covance Series Preferred Stock has been designated by the Board. As of December31,
2013, no Covance Series Preferred Stock has been issued or is outstanding.  DividendsCommon Stock  Covance Board of Directors may declare dividends on the shares of Covance common stock out of legally available funds subject to
any preferential rights of any outstanding Covance Series Preferred Stock. However, Covance has no present intention to declare dividends, but instead intends to retain earnings to provide funds for
the operation and expansion of its business.  Treasury Stock  The Board of Directors has, from time to time, approved stock repurchase programs enabling Covance to repurchase shares of its common
stock. In December 2013, the Covance Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100million of the Company outstanding common stock the 2013 Repurchase Program. As of
December31, 2013, no shares have been repurchased under the 2013 Repurchase Program. In January 2012, the Covance Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300million of
the Company outstanding common stock the 2012 Repurchase Program. This was in addition to 08million shares remaining under a 30million share buyback authorization approved by

under the 2010 EEPP are available for grant under the 2013 EEPP. The 2013 EEPP became effective on May7, 2013 and will expire on May6, 2023. The 2013 EEPP authorizes the Compensation
and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors the Compensation Committee, or such committee as is appointed by the Covance Board of Directors, to administer the 2013 EEPP and to grant
awards to employees of Covance. The 2013 EEPP authorizes the Compensation Committee to grant the following awards: options to purchase common stock; stock appreciation rights; and other stock awards
either singly or in combination. Shares granted, other than options or SARs, shall be counted against the shares available for grant based upon the ratio of 209 for every one share granted. The
exercise period for stock options granted under the 2013 EEPP is determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant, and is generally ten years from the date of grant. The vesting period
for stock options and stock awards granted under the 2013 EEPP is determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant. Beginning in 2012, options and restricted stock awards are generally
granted with a pro rata four year vesting period, whereas previously, they were generally granted with a pro rata three year vesting period. Performance-based restricted stock awards generally vest
over a three year period. The number of shares of Covance common stock initially available for grant under the 2013 EEPP totaled 28million plus approximately 08million shares
remaining available under the 2010 EEPP at the time the 2013 EEPP was approved. All grants and awards under the 2010 EEPP remaining outstanding are administered in accordance with the provisions of
the 2010 EEPP out of shares issuable under the 2013 EEPP. The Company may issue authorized but previously unissued shares or treasury shares when options are exercised or for stock awards. There have
been no grants of stock appreciation rights under the 2010 EEPP or the 2013 EEPP. At December31, 2013 there were approximately 36million shares remaining available for grants under
the 2013 EEPP. 
The
Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the related awards based upon the grant-date fair value of awards expected to
vest. Results of operations for the year ended December31, 2013 include $415million $285million net of tax benefit of $130million of total stock-based compensation
expense, $182million of which has been included in cost of revenue and $233million of which has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Results of operations
for the year ended December31, 2012 include $408million $279million net of tax benefit of $129million of total stock-based compensation expense 208million of which has been included in cost of revenue and $200million of which has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Results of operations for the
year ended December31, 2011 include $401million $274million net of tax benefit of $127million of total stock-based compensation expense, $200million of
which has been included in cost of revenue and $201million of which has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses. OptionsThe grant-date fair value of stock option awards is estimated using an option pricing model. The
Company uses the Lattice-Binomial option
pricing formula to estimate the grant-date fair value of stock option awards. In order to estimate the grant-date fair value, option pricing models require the use of estimates and assumptions as to
athe expected term of the option, bthe expected volatility of the price of the underlying stock, cthe risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option and
dpre-vesting forfeiture rates. The expected term of the option is based upon the contractual term, taking into account
expected employee exercise and expected post-vesting employment termination behavior. The expected volatility of the

price
of the underlying stock is based upon the volatility of the Company stock computed over a period of time equal to the expected term of the option. The risk free interest rate is based upon the
implied yields currently available from the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve for issues with a remaining duration equal to the expected term of the option. Pre-vesting forfeiture rates are
estimated based upon past voluntary termination behavior and past option forfeitures. The
following table sets forth the weighted average assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011:

Cash
proceeds from stock options exercised during the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 totaled $651million, $127million and $68million,
respectively. The cash flows resulting from tax benefits realized on tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recognized for stock options exercised in the period are classified as a
financing cash flow. The excess tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow during the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $61million, $11million and
$09million, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized on stock options exercised during the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $61million 17million and $17million, respectively. The difference between the actual tax benefit received and the excess tax benefit for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, of
$06million and $08million, respectively, is classified as an operating cash inflow.

12.Assets Held for Sale  Covance records long-lived assets as held for sale when a plan to sell the asset has been initiated and all other held for sale criteria have been
satisfied. Assets classified as held
for sale are recorded in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. It is the intention of Covance to complete the
sale of each of these assets within the upcoming year. During
the fourth quarter of 2013, Covance entered into negotiations to sell certain assets of its Genomics Laboratory located in Seattle, Washington, which is part of the early
development segment. As a result, $44million of property and equipment and $23million of inventory were reclassified to assets held for sale as of December31, 2013. 
During
the first quarter of 2013, Covance completed the closure of its clinical pharmacology site in Basel, Switzerland, which is part of the early development segment, and initiated
actions to sell that property. As a result, the $83million carrying value of the property was reclassified from property and equipment to assets held for sale as of March31, 2013.
During the fourth quarter of 2013, Covance recorded an impairment charge of $23million to reduce the carrying value of the Basel property to its estimated fair market value less cost to sell
as of December31, 2013. 
In
the fourth quarter of 2011, Covance completed the wind-down and transition of services at its toxicology facility in Vienna, Virginia, which is part of the early development segment,
and initiated actions to sell that property. As a result, the related carrying value of $270million was reclassified from property and equipment to assets held for sale. 
13.Segment Information  Covance has two reportable segments: early development and late-stage development. Early development services, which includes Covance discovery support
services, preclinical and
clinical pharmacology service capabilities, involve evaluating a new compound for safety and early effectiveness as well as evaluating the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the
compound in the human body. It is at this stage that a pharmaceutical company, based on available data, will generally decide whether to continue further development of a drug. Late-stage development
services, which includes Covance central laboratory, PhaseII-IV clinical development and market access services, are geared toward demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of a compound in
treating certain diseases or conditions, obtaining regulatory approval and maximizing the drug commercial potential. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those
described in Note2.

14.Quarterly Results Unaudited  Covance
quarterly operating results are subject to variation, and are expected to continue to be subject to variation, as a result of factors such as 1delays in initiating
or completing significant drug development trials, 2termination or reduction in size of drug development trials, 3acquisitions and divestitures, 4changes in the mix of
our services, and 5exchange rate fluctuations. Delays and terminations of trials are often the result of actions taken by Covance customers or regulatory authorities and are not typically
controllable by Covance. Since a large amount of Covance operating costs are relatively fixed while revenue is subject to fluctuation, moderate variations in the commencement, progress or completion
of drug development trials may cause significant variations in quarterly results.
