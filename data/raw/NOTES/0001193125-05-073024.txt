Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  
MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f
and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: i pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of
the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework.  A material weakness is a
control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Management identified the
following material weaknesses in its assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting:  As of December 31, 2004, the Company did not maintain effective controls over the valuation of its property and equipment accounts, including the related restructuring provision.
Specifically, the Companys impairment analysis of its property and equipment accounts related to its decision to vacate a facility failed to identify and include all applicable assets. This control deficiency resulted in a restatement of the
Companys financial statements for the quarters ended June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004 and an adjustment to the fourth quarter 2004 financial statements. Additionally, this control deficiency could result in a misstatement to the property
and equipment accounts and related restructuring provision that would result in a material misstatement to annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, management has determined that this condition
constitutes a material weakness.  As of December 31, 2004, the Company did not maintain effective controls over the accounting for income taxes, including the determination of income taxes payable,
deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the related income tax provision. Specifically, the Company did not have controls to identify that deferred income tax assets and related deferred income tax valuation allowances had been
inappropriately recorded. Further, the Company did not have controls in place to include all state income tax liabilities in its income taxes payable account. These control deficiencies resulted in a restatement of the Companys financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2003, the quarters ended March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004, and an adjustment to the fourth quarter 2004 financial statements. Additionally, these control deficiencies could result in a
misstatement to the income taxes payable, deferred income tax asset and liabilities, and income tax provision accounts that 
53 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements 
would result in a material misstatement to annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, management has
determined that these conditions constitute material weaknesses.  Because of these material weaknesses, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2004 based on the criteria set forth in the COSO
Internal Control-Integrated Framework.  Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included herein.  Remediation Steps to
Address Material Weaknesses  The Companys management
has identified the steps necessary to address the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described above. Our remediation plan is:  To document the standards established by our principal financial and accounting officer and other senior accounting personnel for the review, analysis, verification and final
determination of the proper accounting treatment for all charges associated with the termination or abandonment of building leases, including establishing a checklist of items to be reviewed in connection with such transactions;
To improve the skills, knowledge and experience available to the Company for the preparation and review of our tax provision calculations, through potentially hiring additional tax
accounting personnel and by utilizing outside tax consultants;  To improve the process, procedures and documentation standards relating to the preparation of the income tax provision calculations; and  To increase the level of review of the preparation of the quarterly and annual income tax provision calculations.  The Company has begun executing on a remediation plan and expects to have
implemented the new control procedures and to have hired additional tax accounting personnel by the end of the second quarter of 2005.  /s/STEPHANIE G.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Advent Software, Inc:  We have completed an integrated audit of Advent Software, Inc.s 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.  Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
listed in the index appearing under a1 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Advent Software, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the index
appearing under a2 present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  Internal control over financial reporting  Also, we have audited managements assessment, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item
8, that Advent Software, Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, because the Company did not maintain effective controls over: i the valuation of its property and equipment accounts,
including the related restructuring provision, and ii the accounting for income taxes, including the determination of income taxes payable, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the related income tax provision based on criteria
established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our
audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions.  A companys internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A companys internal control over financial reporting

includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control
deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in
managements assessment: the Company did not maintain effective controls over: i the valuation of its property and equipment accounts, including a related restructuring provision, and ii the accounting for income taxes, including the
determination of income taxes payable, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the related income tax provision.  These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2004 consolidated
financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements.  In our opinion, managements assessment that Advent Software, Inc. did
not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Also, in our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Advent Software, Inc. has not maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
As discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated
financial statements, the Company has restated its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2003.  /S/PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose, California April 8, 2005

ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Note 1Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies  Business description: Advent
Software, Inc. Advent or the Company provides stand-alone and client/server software products, data and data interfaces and related maintenance and services that automate, integrate and support certain mission-critical
functions of the front, middle and back offices of investment management organizations. Advents clients vary significantly in size and assets under management and include investment advisors, brokerage firms, banks, hedge funds, corporations,
public funds, foundations, universities and non-profit organizations.  Basis of presentation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Advent and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and amounts have been eliminated.  Year End: Advents fiscal year ends on December 31. 
Foreign currency translation: The functional currency of the
Companys foreign subsidiaries is their local currencies. All assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues, costs and expenses are translated at
the average rate of exchange during the period.  Use of
estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based on information available as of the date
of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Fair value of financial instruments: The amounts reported for cash equivalents, marketable securities, receivables, and accounts payable are considered to approximate their market values based on comparable
market information available at the respective balance sheet dates and their short-term nature.  Cash and cash equivalents: Cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of 90 days
or less at the date of purchase. These securities are maintained with major financial institutions.  Marketable securities: All of Advents marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. The
unrealized gains and losses, net of any related tax effect, are reported in accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, with the exception of Advents broker/dealer
subsidiary, which reports unrealized gains and losses in interest income and other expense, net. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income and
other expense, net.  Investments: Investments are
included in other assets and consist of non-marketable investments in privately held companies, most of which can be considered in the start-up or development stages. The Companys investments in privately held companies are assessed for
impairment when a review of the investees operations indicates that the decline in value of the investment is other than temporary. Such indicators include, but are not limited to, limited capital resources, limited prospects of receiving
additional financing, and prospects for liquidity of the related securities. Impaired investments in privately held companies are written down to estimated fair value. The Company estimates fair value using a variety of valuation methodologies. Such
methodologies include comparing the private company with publicly traded companies in similar lines of 
61 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
business, applying revenue multiples to estimated future operating results for the private company and estimating discounted cash flows for that company.
Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on investments are included in interest income and other expense, net.  Product development: Product development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits for the Companys development and technical support
staff, contractors fees and other costs associated with the enhancements of existing products and services and development of new products and services. Costs incurred for software development prior to technological feasibility are expensed as
product development costs in the period incurred. Once the point of technological feasibility is reached, which is generally the completion of a working prototype that has been certified as having no critical bugs and is a release candidate or has
alternative future uses, development costs are capitalized until the product is ready for general release. To date, software development costs incurred between completion of a working prototype and general availability of the related product have
not been significant and have not been capitalized.  Capitalization of internal use software: Certain costs related to computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position
No. 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. The Company amortizes internal use software costs over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to five years. Costs of $403,000 734,000 and $414,000 related to the development of internal use software were capitalized in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively and classified as property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets.  Additionally, Advent capitalizes certain costs incurred for web site design
and development in accordance with Emerging Issue Task Force No. 00-2, Accounting for Web Site Development costs. These costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to five years. Web site design and
development costs of $108,000 were capitalized in 2004. No costs were capitalized in 2003 or 2002.  Property and equipment: Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Advent calculates depreciation
and amortization using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful lives. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the assets or the
remaining lease term. The cost and related accumulated depreciation applicable to property and equipment sold or no longer in service are eliminated from the accounts and any gains or losses are generally included in operating expenses. Useful lives
by principal classifications are as follows:  Computer equipment and software
1to6years
Leasehold improvements
2 to 5 years
Furniture and fixtures
3 to 5 years
Telephone system
1to10years
Repairs and
maintenance expenditures, which are not considered improvements and do not extend the useful life of the property and equipment, are expensed as incurred.  Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired enterprise or assets over the fair values of the identifiable assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be
recoverable. Advent completes the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter as of November 1 of each year. During 2004, Advent determined that its operations were organized into five reporting units as of November 1, 2004. 
62 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
These tests are performed at the reporting unit level using a two-step, fair-value based approach.
The first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its respective carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and
the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. The second step, used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount
of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires judgment at
many points during the test including future revenue forecasts, discount rates and various reporting unit allocations. During the fourth quarter of 2004, as part of the Companys annual impairment test, Advent completed the first step which did
not indicate impairment. Therefore, the second step of the impairment test was not necessary.  Accounting for long-lived assets: Advent reviews property and equipment and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include the following: 1 significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; 2 significant
changes in the manner of Advents use of the acquired assets or the strategy for Advents overall business; 3 significant negative industry or economic trends; 4 significant decline in the Companys stock price for a sustained
period; and 5 significant decline in Advents market capitalization relative to net book value. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows. If such assets
are considered to be impaired, the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value which is based on estimated cash flows from these assets.  Other intangibles assets mainly represent completed technology, distributor
licenses, customer lists and trade names acquired in business combinations. Identifiable intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:  Purchased technology
3to7years
Customer relationships
4 to 7 years
Other
3 years
Revenue
recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from software licenses, development fees, maintenance, other recurring revenues, professional services and other revenues. In addition, Advent earns commissions from customers who use the
Companys broker/dealer, Second Street Securities, to soft dollar the purchase of non-Advent product and services. Soft dollaring enables the customers to use the commissions earned on trades to pay all or part of the
fees owed to the Company for non-Advent products or services, which are initially paid for by Second Street Securities. The commission revenues earned from soft dollaring non-Advent products or services are recorded as other revenues in
professional services and other revenues.  Advent offers a wide
variety of products and services to a large number of financially sophisticated customers. While many of the Companys lower-priced license transactions, maintenance contracts, subscription-based transactions and professional services projects
conform to a standard structure, many of the Companys larger transactions are complex and may require significant review and judgment in the application of generally accepted accounting principles.  Software license and development fees: Advent recognizes revenue from
the licensing of software when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable and

collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Advent generally uses a signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement. Sales through
its distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding order forms and signed contracts from the distributors customers. Revenue is recognized upon shipment to the distributors customer and
when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Delivery occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier F.O.B shipping point. While many of the Companys arrangements generally do not include acceptance provisions, certain
complex deals may involve acceptance criteria. If acceptance provisions are provided, delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance. The Company assesses whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the
transaction. The Company assesses whether the collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured based on a number of factors, including the credit worthiness of the customer determined through review of credit reports, Advents
transaction history with the customer, and other available information and pertinent country risk if the customer is located outside the United States. Advents standard payment terms are due on receipt; however, terms may vary
based on the country in which the agreement is executed. Software licenses are sold with maintenance and, frequently, professional services. Advent allocates revenue to delivered components, normally the license component of the arrangement, using
the residual method, based on vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered elements generally the maintenance and professional services components, which is specific to Advent. Advent determines fair value of the
undelivered elements based on the historical evidence of the Companys stand-alone sales of these elements to third parties. When VSOE does not exist for undelivered elements, then the entire arrangement fee is deferred until delivery has
occurred. Advent offers term licenses as an alternative to perpetual licenses and recognizes revenue for term licenses ratably over the period of the contract term. Advent has begun a transition from selling mostly perpetual licenses to selling a
mix of term and perpetual contracts. Including our entry level product, Advent Office Essentials, we recognized approximately 10%, 4% and 1% of license revenue from term licenses in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Development fees are derived from contracts that the Company has entered into
with other companies, including customers and development partners. Agreements for which Advent receives development fees generally provide for the development of technologies and products that are expected to become part of the Companys
product offerings in the future. Revenues for license development projects are recognized primarily using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, based on costs incurred to date compared with the estimated cost of completion, or using the
completed contract method, when the development project is finished.  If a customer buys Advent software and chooses to enter into a soft dollar arrangement through the Companys in-house broker/dealer subsidiary, Second Street Securities, the soft dollar arrangement does not
change or modify the original fixed or determinable fee in the written contract. The customer is required to pay the original fee for Advent software within one year. If insufficient trading volume is generated to pay the entire original fee within
one year, the customer is still required to render payment within one year. If the customer chooses to use a third-party broker/dealer, the original payment terms apply, regardless of the arrangement with the third-party broker/dealer. The option to
soft dollar a transaction does not alter the underlying revenue recognition for the transaction; all the revenue recognition criteria listed in the Software license and development fees section above must be assessed in
determining how the revenue will be recognized.  Advents
standard practice is to enforce contract terms and not allow customers to return software. Advent has, however, on limited occasions allowed customers to return software and have recorded sales returns reserves as offsets to revenue in the period
the sales return becomes probable, in accordance with FASB Statement No. 48, Revenue Recognition when Right of Return Exists. The estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns and other related
factors.

Advent does have three situations where it provides a contractual limited right of return to end-user
customers only: in shrink-wrap license agreements for Advent, and its MicroEdge and NPO products. The shrink-wrap license agreement for Advent product provides for a right of return within seven days of delivery of the software. The MicroEdge
software license agreement allows for a thirty-day money back guarantee. The NPO license agreement allows for a seven-day right of return. The Company recognizes revenue on delivery since the fee is fixed or determinable, the buyer is obligated to
pay, the risk of loss passes to the customer, and the Company has the ability to estimate returns. The Companys ability to estimate returns is based on a long history of experience with relatively homogenous transactions and the fact that the
return period is short. The Company has recorded a sales returns reserve contra revenue account to account for these situations based on Advents historical experience of $03 million, $13 million and $35 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.  Maintenance and other recurring
revenues: Advent offers annual maintenance programs that provide for technical support and updates to its software products. Maintenance fees are charged in the initial licensing year and for renewals of annual maintenance in subsequent years.
Advent offers other recurring revenue services that are either subscription-based or transaction-based, and primarily include the provision of software interfaces with, and the capability to download securities information from, third party data
providers. Fair value for maintenance is based upon renewal rates stated in the contracts or, in limited cases, separate sales of renewals to other customers. Advent recognizes revenue for maintenance ratably over the contract term. Advent
recognizes revenue from recurring revenue transactions either ratably over the subscription period or as the transactions occur.  Subscription-based revenues and any related set-up fees are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.  Professional services and other revenues: The Company offers a variety
of professional services that include project management, implementation, data conversion, integration, custom report writing and training. Fair value for professional services is based upon separate sales of these services by Advent to other
customers. The Companys professional services are generally billed based on hourly rates together with reimbursement for travel and accommodation expenses. Advents professional services and other revenues also include revenue from its
annual user conferences. The Company generally recognizes revenues as these professional services are performed. Certain professional services arrangements involve acceptance criteria. In these cases, revenue and related expenses are recognized upon
acceptance.  Effective January 1, 2004, commission revenues
received from soft dollar transactions for products and services not related to Advent products and services, are recorded as other revenues on a net basis as Advent is not the primary obligor in these transactions. Revenues from these
soft dollar transactions are recognized on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur.  Allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns: Advent analyzes specific accounts receivable, historical bad debts, customer concentrations,
customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Advent also analyzes customer demand and acceptance of product and historical returns
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns, which are not generally provided to customers. Allowances for sales returns are accounted for as deductions to net revenues and increases to reserves within deferred revenues.
Advertising costs: The Company expenses advertising
costs as incurred and classify these costs under sales and marketing expense. Total advertising expenses were $215,000, $78,000 and $85,000 for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Stock-based compensation: Advent uses the intrinsic value method to account for all
stock-based employee compensation plans and has adopted the disclosure-only alternative of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Advent is required to disclose the pro forma effects on operating results as if it had elected to use the fair value approach to account for all its stock-based employee compensation plans.
Stock-based compensation for non-employees is based on the fair value of the related stock or options.  The fair value of warrants, options or stock exchanged for services is expensed over the period benefited. The warrants and options are valued using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model.  If compensation had been
determined based on the fair value at the grant date for awards in 2004, 2003 and 2002, consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Advents net loss and net loss per share for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, would have been as

Assumes an effective tax rate of 0% for fiscal 2004 and 2003 due to the full valuation allowance established against the Companys deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter
of 2003, and 34% for fiscal 2002.  Such pro forma
disclosures may not be representative of future compensation costs because options vest over several years and additional grants are made each year.  The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted were $1049, $1786 and $3985 per option for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
weighted-average grant-date fair value of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan rights was $453, $1375 and $1573 per option for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The fair value of each option grant and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan rights were estimated on the

future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities be recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities. Generally accepted accounting principles require the Company to evaluate the realizability of
net deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized. Significant factors considered by management in assessing the need for a
valuation allowance include the Companys historical operating results, the length of time over which the differences will be realized, tax planning opportunities and expectations for future earnings. In considering whether or not the Company
will realize a future benefit from net deferred tax assets, recent losses must be given substantially more weight than any projections of future profitability. 
Net income loss per share: Basic net income loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for that period. Diluted net income per share is computed giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential shares consist of incremental common shares
issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants and conversion of preferred stock none outstanding for all periods.  Comprehensive income loss: Comprehensive income loss consists of net income loss, net unrealized foreign currency translation adjustment and
net unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale marketable securities and is presented in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity.  Segment information: The Company has determined that it has the following two reportable segments: 1 Advent Investment Management, and 2
MicroEdge. Advent Investment Management derives revenues from the development, marketing and sale of stand-alone and client/server software products, data interfaces and related maintenance and services that automate, integrate and support certain
mission critical functions of investment management organizations. MicroEdge derives revenues from the sale of software and services for grant management, matching gifts and volunteer tracking for the grantmaking community worldwide.  International sales, which are based on the location to which the product is
shipped or services are delivered, represented 9%, 7% and 5% of the Companys net revenues for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues for fiscal 2004, 2003 or 2002. 
67 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Certain risks and concentrations: Product revenues are concentrated in the computer software
industry, which is highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant technological changes in the industry or customer requirements, or the emergence of competitive products with new capabilities or technologies could adversely affect operating
results. Additionally, Advent derives a significant portion of its revenues from licensing its Axys application and its ancillary products and services, and therefore its market acceptance is essential to the Companys success.  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risks comprise, principally, cash, short-term marketable securities, and trade accounts receivable. Advent invests excess cash through banks, mutual funds, and brokerage houses primarily in highly liquid securities and has investment
policies and procedures that are reviewed periodically to minimize credit risk. Advents marketable securities consist of diversified investment grade securities traded in the United States of America. The Company believes no significant
concentration of credit risk exists with respect to these securities.  With respect to accounts receivable, Advent performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses on customer accounts when deemed
necessary. At December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable.  Reclassifications: Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications had no
effect on results of operations or stockholders equity.  Common Stock Repurchases: The number of shares repurchased by Advent and the timing of repurchases are based on several factors, including the price of Advents stock, general market conditions, and alternative investment
opportunities. The purchases are funded from available working capital.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements: In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS 123R which requires the measurement of all employee share-based payments to employees, including grants of
employee stock options, using a fair-value-based method and the recording of such expense in Advents consolidated statements of operations. The accounting provisions of SFAS 123R are effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15,
2005. Advent is required to adopt SFAS 123R in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. See Stock-Based
Compensation above for the pro forma net loss and net loss per share amounts, for fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2004, as if Advent had used a fair-value-based method similar to the methods required under SFAS 123R to measure compensation expense
for employee stock incentive awards. Although the Company has not yet determined whether the adoption of SFAS 123R will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123, Advent is evaluating the requirements
under SFAS 123R and expects the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on Advents consolidated results of operations and net income loss per share.  In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109-1 FAS 109-1, Application of FASB
Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 AJCA. The AJCA introduces a special 9% tax deduction on
qualified production activities. FAS 109-1 clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special tax deduction in accordance with Statement 109. Advent does not expect the adoption of these new tax provisions to have a material
impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109-2 FAS 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creations
Act of

2004. The AJCA introduces a limited time 85% dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer
repatriation provision, provided certain criteria are met. FAS 109-2 provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision. Because Advent has a policy of permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings, there is no tax benefit
included in the current years provision for income tax. Advent does not expect the adoption of FAS 109-2 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of
Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment to APB Opinion No. 29 APB No. 29. SFAS No. 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transaction that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets
exchanged. SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005 and is required to be adopted by the Company in third quarter of 2005. Advent does not expect the adoption of SFAS No.
153 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In November 2004, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 03-13 EITF 03-13, Applying the Conditions in Paragraph 42 of
FASB Statement No. 144 SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, in Determining Whether to Report Discontinued Operations. EITF 03-13 clarifies the approach for assessing whether
the conditions in paragraph 42 of SFAS No. 144 for reporting results of a disposed component as discontinued operations have been met. EITF 03-13 should be applied to a component of an enterprise that is either disposed of or classified as held for
sale in fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2004. Previously reported operating results related to transactions initiated within an enterprises fiscal year that includes the date that this consensus is ratified may be reclassified to
reflect the consensus. EITF 03-13 did not, and is not expected to, have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In June 2004, the FASB issued EITF 02-14, Whether an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to
Investments Other Than Common Stock. EITF 02-14 addresses whether the equity method of accounting applies when an investor does not have an investment in voting common stock of an investee but exercises significant influence through other
means. EITF 02-14 states that an investor should only apply the equity method of accounting when it has investments in either common stock or in-substance common stock of a corporation, provided that the investor has the ability to exercise
significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The accounting provisions of EITF 02-14 are effective for reporting periods beginning after September 15, 2004. The adoption of EITF 02-14 did not have a material
impact on Advents consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In March 2004, the FASB issued EITF issue No. 03-1 EITF 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, as amended, which provides new
guidance assessing impairment losses on investments. Additionally, EITF 03-1 includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB delayed the accounting provisions of EITF 03-1;
however the disclosure requirements are effective for this annual report for fiscal 2004. Advent will evaluate the impact of the accounting provisions of EITF 03-1 once final guidance is issued.  In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 SAB
104, Revenue Recognition, which revises or rescinds portions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. The primary purpose of SAB 104 is to rescind
accounting guidance contained in SAB 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements, which was superceded as a result of the issuance of Emerging Issues Task Force 00-21 EITF 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables. SAB 104 also incorporated certain sections of the SECs Revenue Recognition in

Financial StatementsFrequently Asked Questions and Answers document. While the wording of SAB 104 has changed to reflect the issuance of EITF
00-21, the revenue recognition principles of SAB 101 remain largely unchanged by the issuance of SAB 104. The adoption of SAB 104 did not have a material impact on Advents consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Note 2Restatement of Financial Statements  In connection with its preparation of the consolidated financial statements
for the fiscal year ended December31, 2004, management of the Company determined that the previously issued financial statements contained in the Companys Annual Report on Form10-K/A for the year ended December31, 2003 and
the Quarterly Reports on Form10-Q for the quarters ended March31, 2004, June30, 2004 and September30, 2004 should be restated to correct errors in those financial statements. The decision to restate these financial statements
was made after managements discovery of the following errors:  Included in the Companys balance for income taxes payable at December 31, 2003 was a tax contingency reserve of $58 million. This reserve had been specifically established
for certain tax deductions that were included in the deferred tax asset balance at that date. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. The establishment of this full valuation
allowance against the Companys deferred tax assets is described in Note8, Income Taxes, to these consolidated financial statements. Advent believes that the tax contingency reserve, which was established for the probable
disallowance of certain tax deductions, should have been classified as a reduction of the related deferred tax assets and not as a separate liability at December 31, 2003. As a result, the valuation allowance that was recorded in that year should be
reduced by $58million;  Estimated state income tax liabilities of $12 million had not been accrued in the year ended December31, 2003. This error was not detected in the review process for the
Companys tax provision;  During the quarter ended June 30, 2004, the Company vacated a facility in San Francisco, California and should have recognized additional non-cash restructuring charges related to
abandoned property and equipment. As a result, the Company has recognized additional non-cash impairment charges of $09million for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 to reduce impaired property and equipment assets, and reduced depreciation
expense by $36,000 and $35,000 for the quarters ended September 30, 2004 and December31, 2004, respectively; and  Effective January 1, 2004, Advent corrected the classification of revenue from its subsidiary, Second Street Securities, when it engages in soft dollaring of third party products or
services. Under such arrangements, Second Street Securities returns a portion of its commission revenues received from its customers in the form of third party products or services. As a result, revenues and cost of revenues for the three quarterly
periods ending March 31, June 30 and September30, 2004 have been restated to reflect revenue recognition on a net basis from these transactions as Second Street Securities is not the primary obligor. This change does not affect gross margin,
operating loss, or net loss for any periods presented. Advent has not changed revenues and cost of revenues in periods prior to fiscal 2004 as the amounts were not material.  These corrections had no significant impact on the Companys financial statements in periods prior to the quarter ended
December31, 2003.

Note 3Marketable Securities
Based upon the Companys re-evaluation of the
maturity dates associated with auction rate securities, these instruments have been reclassified from cash and cash equivalents to short-term marketable securities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2003. Auction rate
securities are variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates with maturities on the face of the securities in excess of 90 days. Although these securities are issued and rated as long term bonds, they are priced and traded as short term
instruments because of the liquidity provided through interest rate resets which occur every 7, 28 or 35 days. In addition, Purchases of marketable securities and Sales and maturities of marketable securities, included on the
accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows, have been revised to reflect the purchase and sale of auction rate securities during the periods presented. These reclassifications had no impact on Advents results of operations or operating
cash flows for the periods presented.

losses related to investments are primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of debt securities as a result of an increase in interest rates during fiscal 2004. Advent has determined that the gross unrealized losses on its investments at December
31, 2004 are temporary in nature. Advent regularly reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length
of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition, credit quality and near-term prospects of the investee, and Advents ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for
any anticipated recovery in market value.

consisted of $57 million in cash, $242,000 of assumed liabilities and $83,000 of closing costs. A total of $55 million of the cash consideration was paid
at closing and the remaining $02 million was retained by the Company for possible breach of general representations and warranties. The Company will pay this amount to Advent Europe approximately one year after the closing date in the event no such
breach of general representations or warranties exists. In addition, the Company paid an earn-out distribution of approximately $18 million under a formula based on revenue bookings, which was recorded as additional goodwill in the second quarter
of 2004. No further earn-out distributions were earned or paid.  The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired on the basis of their
respective fair values on the acquisition date. The amounts allocated to identifiable intangibles were determined based upon managements estimates using established valuation techniques. The results of operations of Advent United Kingdom and
Advent Switzerland are included in the consolidated statement of operations subsequent to the acquisition date.  The allocation of the purchase price for Advent United Kingdom, Advent Switzerland and certain assets of Advent Europe at the date of purchase was as
follows in thousands, except estimated remaining useful life:

4 913 Employment agreements
3 232 Developed technology
3 710 Tangible assets 2,754 Current liabilities 2,387 Deferred tax liabilities 337 Total purchase price 5,976  Residual goodwill has
been recorded based on the purchase price remaining after allocating the purchase price to the fair market value of assets purchased less liabilities assumed and to identifiable intangible assets. Residual goodwill arises as a result of, among other
factors, new customers as well as the implicit value of future cost savings as a result of the combining of entities. Goodwill resulting from this acquisition was assigned to the Advent Investment Management segment and was expected to be
non-deductible for tax purposes under Internal Revenue Code 197.  Advent Netherlands BV  In May 2003, Advent
purchased all of the common stock of Advent Netherlands BV from its independent European distributor for a total purchase price of $96 million, which includes repayment of a loan and is net of approximately $180,000 cash acquired. In addition,
there was a potential earn-out distribution to the selling stockholders of up to $16 million through December 31, 2003 under a formula based on revenue results for the eight months ended December 31, 2003, plus 50% of any operating margins which
exceed 20% for the year ending December 31, 2004. The right to receive this earn-out was effectively terminated with the purchase of certain assets of Advent Europe on May 3, 2004. Through this date, no additional consideration had been earned or
paid.

Advent Outsource Data Management, LLC.  In November 2002, the Company purchased all of the outstanding membership interests of Advent Outsource Data Management, LLC
Advent Outsource, formerly Outsource Data Management, LLC for $947,000, including $184,000 in acquisition costs. Advent Outsource is an outsource solution provider of portfolio reconciliation and reporting services via the internet.
This acquisition was consistent with the Companys strategy to add products and services that meet the needs of a wide variety of sectors in the financial services industry by adding outsourcing capabilities to the solutions Advent offers
clients, particularly in the financial planning and independent broker/dealer areas.  In addition to the initial cash consideration, there is a potential earn-out distribution to the selling members of up to $5 million through December 31, 2004 under a formula based on revenue bookings. Through
December 31, 2004, the Company accrued earn-out distributions of approximately $39 million, of which $31 million was paid in 2004 and $08 million will be paid in the first quarter of 2005. The contingent consideration was recorded as additional
goodwill.  The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase
transaction and accordingly, the tangible assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at their fair value at the date of the acquisition. The amounts allocated to identifiable intangibles were determined based upon managements estimates
using established valuation techniques. The results of operations of Advent Outsource were included in Advents consolidated financial statements subsequent to the acquisition date.

Advent Hellas  In September 2002, Advent acquired all of the common stock of its Greek distributor, Advent Hellas, for a total purchase price of $66 million in cash.
Advent acquired its Greek distributors operations to expand its direct ownership of European channels for Advents products and services. In connection with this acquisition, Advent was required to pay 50% of Advent Hellas operating
margins that exceed 20% for the two years after the acquisition. This earn-out was effectively terminated with the purchase of certain assets of Advent Europe on May 3, 2004. Through this date, no additional consideration had been earned or paid.
The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction
and accordingly, the tangible assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at their fair value at the date of the acquisition. The amounts allocated to identifiable intangibles were determined based upon managements estimates using
established valuation techniques. The results of operations of Advent Hellas were included in Advents consolidated financial statements subsequent to the acquisition date. Advent has not presented the pro forma results of operations of Advent
Hellas as the results are not material to Advents results of operations.  In the quarter ended December 31, 2002, Advent adjusted its initial allocation of the purchase price for a re-evaluation of the intangibles and an adjustment to deferred tax liabilities resulting in an increase to
goodwill of $379,000.  The final allocation of the Advent
Hellas purchase price was as follows in thousands, except estimated remaining useful life:

Goodwill resulting from the acquisition was assigned to the Advent Investment Management segment and
was determined to be non-deductible for tax purposes under Internal Revenue Code 197.  During 2004, Advent recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $14 million to write off the carrying value of intangible assets related to Advent Hellas. See Note 5, Balance Sheet Detail for additional
information.  Techfi Corporation  In July 2002, Advent acquired Techfi Corporation, a privately held company.
Techfi provides software, technology and services to the financial intermediary market. This acquisition was consistent with Advents strategy to add products and services for meeting the needs of a wide variety of sectors in the financial
services industry, particularly in the financial planning and independent broker/dealer areas of Techfis strengths.  The total purchase price of $228 million included cash of $202 million, acquisition related expenses of approximately $800,000 and options to purchase
70,000 shares of Advent common stock valued at $18 million. The options were valued using the Black-Scholes method to determine fair value, have an exercise price of $1739 per share, vest over five years, and expire in August 2012.  The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction and accordingly,
the tangible assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at their fair value at the date of the acquisition. The amounts allocated to identifiable intangibles were determined based upon managements estimates using established valuation
techniques. The results of operations of Techfi Corporation were included in Advents consolidated financial statements subsequent to the acquisition date. 
At the time of the acquisition, there was $23 million of additional contingent consideration held in escrow for 14 months for protection against
undisclosed liabilities. In 2003 and 2004, Advent paid $20 million and $03million, respectively, of the contingent consideration held in escrow and recorded increases to goodwill.  At the acquisition date, Techfis primary purchased in-process research and development IPRD
projects involved the development of a web-enabled system for portfolio management, performance reporting and contact management; distributable macro language to automate operational tasks such as downloading, importing and report printing; and
enhancements to their currently offered AdvisorMart service.  Purchased IPRD for Techfi represents the present value of the estimated after-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased technology, which, at the acquisition date, had not yet reached technological feasibility. The cash
flow projections for revenues were based on estimated projected revenue and expenses beyond 2003 and expected industry benchmarks. Revenue estimates also include an estimated annual attrition percentage to account for the fact that, as time passes,
the portion of projected revenue attributable to purchased IPRD technologies will become less as newer technology replaces the capabilities and functionality of the purchased IPRD technologies. Estimated operating expenses and income taxes
were deducted from estimated revenue projections to arrive at after-tax cash flows. Projected operating expenses included costs of goods sold, research and development, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses, including
estimated costs to maintain the products once they have been introduced into the market and are generating revenue. The rates utilized to discount projected cash flows were 20% to 35% for in-process technologies and were based primarily on rates of
return and the overall level of market acceptance and the amount of time each respective technology has been in the marketplace. The projects were completed in 2002 within budgeted guidelines.

Index to Financial Statements ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
As of the date of acquisition, Advent concluded that the purchased in-process technology had no
alternative future use after taking into consideration the potential use of the technology in different products, the stage of development and life cycle of each project and resale of the software. Therefore, Advent immediately expensed the value of
the purchased IPRD of $15 million upon acquisition.  In
the fourth quarter of 2002, Advent updated the initial allocation of the Techfi purchase price for adjustments related to intangibles, assumed liabilities and deferred tax liabilities resulting in a net increase to goodwill of $300,000. 
The final allocation of the Techfi purchase price was as follows in
thousands, except estimated remaining useful life:

from the acquisition was assigned to the Advent Investment Management segment and was determined to be non-deductible for tax purposes under Internal Revenue Code 197.  During 2004, Advent recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $34 million to write off the carrying value of intangible
assets related to the Techfi product line. See Note 5, Balance Sheet Detail for additional information.  Kinexus Corporation  In February 2002, Advent acquired Kinexus Corporation, a privately held company located in New York. Kinexus provides internal account aggregation and
manual data management services. The purchase provided core technologies for use in Advent Wealth Services.  The total purchase price of $455 million included cash of $34 million, closing costs of $3 million and a warrant to purchase 165,176 shares of Advent
common stock valued at $85 million. The fair value of the warrant was calculated using the Black-Scholes method using the following assumptions: fair value of common stock of $5134 per share, interest rate of 3%, volatility of 659% and a dividend
rate of zero. The warrant had an exercise price of $001 per share and was exercised in February 2002.  The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction and accordingly, the tangible assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at their fair
value at the date of the acquisition. The amounts allocated to

identifiable intangibles were determined based upon managements estimates using established valuation techniques. The results of operations of Kinexus
Corporation were included in Advents consolidated financial statements subsequent to the acquisition date.  During 2002, Advent adjusted Kinexus goodwill and liabilities assumed, decreasing both by $49 million. The adjustment primarily related to a reduction of
the estimated liability assumed in connection with a vacant Kinexus facility located in downtown Manhattan within a few blocks of the World Trade Center site and was based on additional analysis of the local commercial rental market.

Note 5Balance Sheet Detail
Effective April 1, 2004, Advent changed its methodology
for recording accounts receivable and deferred revenues. In prior periods, Advent netted down amounts in deferred revenues that were still outstanding as a receivable. Beginning on April 1, 2004, accounts receivable and deferred revenues except for
future maintenance and contract deliverables not yet earned are presented gross instead of net, as no offset entry is made. This has the effect of increasing accounts receivable and deferred revenues by equal amounts. There is no impact on the
consolidated statements of operations.  Supplemental

and impairment of developed technology within cost of revenues as it relates to existing and core technology and the remaining $24 million was included in
operating expenses. In September 2004, the Company decided to discontinue certain products within the Techfi product line, which was acquired in July 2002, as demand for the Techfi product line has been significantly lower than expected. As a result
of this triggering event, the Company began a review of the recoverability of its Techfi-related intangible assets. Recoverability was measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows.
The Company determined that these intangible assets had no remaining value and wrote off the remaining carrying value in 2004.  During 2004, Advent recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $681,000 to write off the carrying value of intangible assets related to Advent Wealth
Services AWS. Of this amount, $255,000 was included in amortization and impairment of developed technology within cost of revenues as it relates to existing and core technology and the remaining $426,000 was included in operating
expenses. During the fourth quarter of 2004, as a result of the combined triggering events of significant underperformance by AWS relative to historical and projected future operating results, as well as Advents decision to re-focus the
Companys direction on its core businesses, the Company began a review of the recoverability of its AWS-related intangible assets. Recoverability was measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future
undiscounted net cash flows. The Company determined that these intangible assets had no remaining value and wrote off the remaining carrying value in 2004.  During 2004, Advent recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $14 million, included in operating expenses, to write off the carrying value of intangible
assets related to Advent Hellas. During the fourth quarter of 2004, as a result of the triggering event of significant underperformance by Advent Hellas relative to historical and projected future operating results, the Company began a review of the
recoverability of its Advent Hellas intangible assets. Recoverability was measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows. The Company determined that these intangible assets had no
remaining value and wrote off the remaining carrying value in 2004.  During 2003, Advent recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $887,000, included in cost of revenues, to write off the carrying value of intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of ManagerLink in November 2001. When Advent
acquired Kinexus in February 2002, some redundancy existed between the technology acquired from ManagerLink and the technology acquired from Kinexus. The Company transitioned business operations off the ManagerLink platform and abandoned the
technology as of September 2003. As a result, the Company began a review of the recoverability of its ManagerLink-related intangible assets. Recoverability was measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future
undiscounted net cash flows. The Company determined that these intangible assets had no remaining value and wrote off the remaining carrying value in 2003.

include equity investments in several privately held companies, most of which can still be considered in the start-up or development stages. In 2002, Advent acquired approximately 15% of the outstanding stock of LatentZero Limited
LatentZero, a privately-held company located in the United Kingdom, for $7 million. Through December 28, 2004, LatentZero was accounted for under the equity method of accounting as Advents Chief Executive Officer was a member of
LatentZeros board of directors and Advent accordingly considered itself to have significant influence over this company. The Companys portion of net loss from this investee was $257,000, $104,000 and $58,000 for fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. Effective December 28, 2004, Advents Chief Executive Officer resigned her seat on the investees board of directors and as a result, Advent no longer believes it has significant influence over LatentZero. Therefore,
this investment is carried at the lower of cost or fair value at December 31, 2004, similar to the Companys other investments.  Advent recorded write-downs of $20 million and $135 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, on various long-term equity investments, as a result of
other-than-temporary declines in the estimated fair market value of such investments. Advent did not record any write-downs in fiscal 2004.  The following is a summary of accrued liabilities in thousands:  December 31 2004

In response to the downturn in the financial services
industry, the decline in information technology spending and duplicative efforts in parts of Advents Investment Management reporting segment as a result of various acquisitions, Advent implemented several phases of restructuring beginning in
2003. These plans were implemented to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies by better aligning the Companys resources to its near-term revenue opportunities.  For fiscal 2004, Advent recorded total restructuring charges of $51 million consisting of $50 million to exit leased
facilities, $09 million for the write-off of property and equipment, $136,000 for severance and benefits associated with the termination of nine employees, and net benefits of $893,000 to adjust original estimates for vacated facilities and
severance charges.  Advent continued to consolidate office
space during 2004 and incurred charges of $49 million for facility and exit costs and $09 million of property and equipment impairment charges related to vacating a facility in San Francisco, California, and $78,000 to vacate a portion of a
facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Advent estimated the cost of exiting and terminating the facility leases based on the contractual terms of the agreements and real estate market conditions. During the year, Advent entered into sub-lease
agreements on vacated facilities in San Francisco and New York and recognized accretion expense to adjust the present value of lease obligations on vacated facilities at December 31, 2004, resulting in a net adjustment to our original estimates of
$794,000. During the year, Advent also incurred charges of $136,000 for severance and benefits related to the termination of nine employees located primarily in New York, and reversed $99,000 of severance and benefits primarily related to employees
terminated in 2003, as costs were lower than previously anticipated.  For fiscal 2003, Advent recorded total restructuring charges of $91 million consisting of $5 million for severance and benefits associated with a workforce reduction of 176 employees, $32 million for costs to exit leased facilities, and
$09 million for the write-off of property and equipment.  The
workforce reduction of 176 employees consisted of 39 employees in client services and support, 25 employees in professional services, 46 employees in product development, 42 employees in sales and marketing and 24 employees in general and
administrative functions. These employees were located in San Francisco, California; New York, New York; Denver, Colorado; Concord, California; and Melbourne, Australia. Included in the charge is $90,000 for non-cash severance associated with
modification to a former employees stock options. The Company also incurred charges associated with consolidating office space in the New York City area and vacating facilities in Melbourne, Australia; Concord, California; and Denver,
Colorado. The Company estimated the cost of exiting and terminating the facility leases based on the contractual terms of the agreements and real estate market conditions. The write-off of property and equipment consisted primarily of leasehold
improvements, computer equipment and related software, and office equipment, furniture and fixtures which were abandoned as a result of vacating various facilities.

At December 31, 2004, Advent had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $110
million. Utilization of these loss carryforwards is subject to certain limitations under the federal income tax laws. These net operating loss carryforwards expire between 2010 and 2024.  Advent also had federal research credits of $97 million which expire between 2019 and 2024 and California research credits
of $73 million which do not expire.  Note 9Commitments and
Contingencies  Advent leases office space and equipment
under non-cancelable operating lease agreements, which expire at various dates through May 2012. Some operating leases contain escalation provisions for adjustments in the consumer price index. Advent is responsible for maintenance, insurance, and
property taxes. Future minimum payments and receipts under the non-cancelable operating leases consisted of the following at December 31, 2004 in thousands:  FutureLeasePayments

Outsource Data Management and the remaining independent distributor businesses of Advent Europe in the United Kingdom and Switzerland in the form of potential earn-out distributions up to $86 million under a formula based on revenue results through
December 31, 2004. Through December 31, 2004, $57 million was earned and recorded as additional goodwill under this provision, of which approximately $08 million will be paid in the first quarter of 2005. Advent does not anticipate any further
earn-outs related to these acquisitions.  As permitted or
required under Delaware law and to the maximum extent allowable under that law, Advent has certain obligations to indemnify its current and former officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was
serving, at Advents request in such capacity. These indemnification obligations are valid as long as the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of
the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The maximum potential amount of future payments Advent could be required to make under these indemnification
obligations is unlimited; however, Advent has a director and officer insurance policy that mitigates Advents exposure and enables Advent to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of Advents insurance policy coverage,
the Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal.  From time to time, Advent is involved in claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Based on currently available information, management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of
88 Table of Contents

these unresolved matters, individually and in the aggregate, are likely to have a material adverse effect on Advents financial position or results of
operations. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and Advents view of these matters may change in the future. Were an unfavorable outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on Advents
financial position and results of operations for the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs, and potentially in future periods.  On March 8, 2005, certain of the former shareholders and the shareholders representative of Kinexus filed suit against Advent in the Delaware
Chancery Court. See Note 15, Subsequent Events, for further discussion.  Note 10Employee Benefit Plans  401k
Plan  Advent sponsors a 401k Plan to provide retirement
benefits for its U.S. employees. This Plan provides for tax-deferred salary deductions for eligible employees. Employees may contribute between 1% and 15% of their annual compensation to this Plan, limited by an annual maximum amount as determined
by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company also makes a 50% matching contribution of up to 6% of employee compensation. The Companys matching contributions to this plan totaled $14 million, $10 million and $13 million for fiscal 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition to the employer matching contribution, Advent may make profit sharing contributions at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Advent did not make any profit sharing contributions in fiscal 2004, 2003 or
2002.  1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan  All individuals employed by Advent are eligible to participate in the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan Purchase Plan if Advent employs them for at least 20 hours per week and at least five months per year. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase Advent common stock through payroll deductions at a price
equal to 85% of the lower of the closing sale price for the Companys common stock reported on the NASDAQ National Market at the beginning or the end of each six-month offering period. In any calendar year, eligible employees can withhold up to
10% of their salary and certain variable compensation. In the second quarter of 2003, Advents shareholders approved an amendment to the Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance by 600,000. As of
December 31, 2004, approximately 1,169,000 shares have been issued out of a total of 1,500,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the Purchase Plan. The Company issued approximately 162,000, 211,000, and 164,000 shares under the
Purchase Plan at weighted average prices of $1569, $1375, and $2011 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

As the Company incurred net losses in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, options and warrants to purchase an
aggregate 57 million, 52 million and 43 million shares, respectively, of the Companys common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share, as the effect would have been antidilutive.  Note 12Stockholders Equity  Common Stock Repurchase  During 2001 and 2002, the Board of Directors the Board
authorized the repurchase of up to 40 million shares of outstanding common stock. Through May 2004 when this program was terminated, Advent had repurchased and retired 38 million shares of common stock since inception of this stock repurchase plan
for a total cost of $788 million and an average price of $2082 per share.  In May 2004, the Board approved a plan to repurchase up to 12 million shares of Advents common stock in the open market. In September 2004, the Board authorized an extension of this stock repurchase program to
cover the repurchase of an additional 08 million shares of outstanding common stock. Through December 2004, Advent had repurchased 07 million shares under this plan for a total cost of $119 million and an average price of $1599 per share. As of
December 31, 2004, approximately 13 million additional shares were available to be repurchased under this share repurchase plan.  On February 22, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved an extension of the Companys stock repurchase program to authorize the
repurchase of an additional 18 million shares of common stock. From January 1, 2005 through March 10, 2005, Advent repurchased 21 million shares under its current common stock repurchase plan for a total cost of $38 million and an average price of
$1787 per share.  Warrants  In March 2001, the Company issued a fully vested non-forfeitable stock
purchase warrant to purchase a total of 191,644 shares of Advent common stock to a customer from whom Advent had revenue of approximately $580,000 $56,000 and $34 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The warrant was issued for cash
consideration of $5 million, which was the estimated Black-Scholes fair value. The warrant has an exercise price of $45375 per share, is immediately exercisable, and expires in March 2006.  In February 2002, Advent acquired Kinexus Corporation, a privately held
company located in New York. The total purchase price of $455 million included cash of $34 million, closing costs of $3 million and a warrant to purchase 165,176 shares of Advent common stock valued at $85 million. The fair value of the warrant
was calculated using the Black-Scholes method using the following assumptions: fair value of common stock of $5134 per share, interest rate of 3%, volatility of 659% and a dividend rate of zero. The warrant had an exercise price of $001 per share
and was exercised in February 2002.  Stock Option Exchange
In November 2002, the Company commenced a voluntary stock
option exchange program made available to certain eligible employees of the Company. The Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer and Executive Vice President of Corporate Development were
specifically excluded from participating in the exchange program. Under the program, eligible employees were given the option to cancel each outstanding stock option granted to them at an exercise price greater than or equal to $20 per share, in
exchange for a new option to buy 08 shares of the Companys common stock to be granted on June 5, 2003, six months and one day from December 4, 2002, the expiration date of the offer, and the date the old 
90 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
options of participating employees were cancelled. Additionally, options granted in the six months prior to this exchange offer, irrespective of their
exercise prices, were cancelled for all employees that elected to participate in this exchange program. There was no credit given for option vesting during the period between cancellation of the outstanding option and the grant of the new option.
The exercise price of the new option is equal to the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. In total, 3,336,504 option shares were eligible to participate in this program and 2,462,102 options were surrendered for
cancellation ranging in exercise price from $1739 to $60375 with a weighted average exercise price of $4733 per share. In the second quarter of 2003, in connection with this voluntary stock option exchange program, Advent granted 1,770,786
replacement options to employees at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant, which was $1888 per share. The exchange program did not result in additional compensation charges or variable option plan
accounting.  Stock Options  Advent has three stock option plans, the 2002 Stock Plan Plan, 1998
Non-statutory Stock Option Plan Non-statutory Plan and 1995 Director Option Plan Director Plan.  The PlanIn February and May 2002, the Board of Directors and the stockholders, respectively, approved the 2002 Stock Plan.
Under the 2002 Stock Plan, the Company may grant options to purchase common stock to employees and consultants. Options granted may be incentive stock options or non-statutory stock options and shall be granted at a price not less than fair market
value on the date of grant. Fair market value as defined in the Plan and the vesting of these options shall be determined by the Board of Directors. The options generally vest over 5 years and expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant.
Unvested options on termination of employment are canceled and returned to the Plan. The 2002 Stock Plan has an evergreen provision which adds an annual increase to the plan on the last day of the Companys fiscal year beginning in
2002 equal to the lesser of: i 1,000,000 shares, ii 2% of the Companys outstanding shares on such date, or iii a lesser number of shares determined by the Board of Directors. All remaining options from the expired 1992 Stock Plan were
rolled over to the 2002 Stock Plan. The terms of the 1992 Stock Plan were substantively the same as the terms of the new 2002 Stock Plan.  In 2001, Advent granted 25,000 stock options to certain employees of its independent European distributor that have an exercise price of $40, vest over 5
years and have a term of 10 years. The options were subject to variable plan accounting, which requires Advent to re-measure compensation cost for outstanding options each reporting period based on changes in the market value of the underlying
common stock until the time the options are exercised, are forfeited or expire unexercised. With respect to these stock options, Advent recorded stock compensation expense of $21,000 and $240,000 in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively, and a
stock-based credit of $2,000 in fiscal 2002. With the acquisition of the remaining distributor businesses in the United Kingdom and Switzerland in 2004, these employees either became employees of Advent or no longer provide services to Advent.
Therefore, Advent ceased recognizing compensation expense related to these options during 2004.  During 2003, Advent also recorded stock compensation expense of $261,000 related to the extension of vesting schedules on the outstanding stock options
held by employees affected by the work-force reductions.  Non-Statutory PlanIn November 1998, the Board of Directors approved the 1998 Non-statutory Stock Option Plan and reserved 300,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder. Under the Companys 1998
Non-statutory Plan, Advent may grant options to purchase common stock to employees and consultants, excluding persons who are executive officers and directors. Options granted are non-statutory stock options and shall be granted at a price not less
than fair market value on the date of grant. Fair market value as defined in the Non-statutory Plan and the vesting of these options shall be determined by the Board of Directors. The options 
91 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
generally vest over 5 years and expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant. Unvested options on termination of employment are canceled and returned
to the Non-statutory Plan.  Director
PlanAdvents 1995 Director Option Plan provides for the grant of non-statutory stock options to the Companys non-employee directors outside directors. Under the Director Plan, each outside
director is granted a non-qualified option to purchase 30,000 shares on the latter of the date of effectiveness of the Director Plan or the date upon which such person first becomes a director. The exercise price of each option is equal to the fair
market value of Advent common stock as of the date of the grant. In subsequent years, each outside director is automatically granted an option to purchase 6,000 shares on December 1 with an exercise price equal to the fair value of Advent common
stock on that date. Initial options granted under the Director Plan vest one-fifth of the shares on the first anniversary date of grant and the remaining shares vest ratably each month over the ensuing four years. Subsequent option grants vest
one-twelfth of the shares four years and one month after the date of grant and the remaining shares vest ratably each month over the next 11-month period. All Director Plan options have a ten-year term.  A summary of the status of the Companys stock option plans for the

Geographical Information  Description of Segments
SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, established standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information about operating segments in interim reports. It also established
standards for related disclosures about products and services, major customers and geographic areas. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by
the chief operating decision maker CODM, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Advents CODM is the Chief Executive Officer.  Advents organizational structure is based on a number of factors that the CODM uses to evaluate, view and run its
business operations which include, but are not limited to, customer base, homogeneity of products and technology. Advents operating segments are based on this organizational structure and information reviewed by Advents CODM to evaluate
the operating segment results. During fiscal 2004, Advent determined that its operations were organized into two reportable segments: 1 Advent Investment Management; and 2 MicroEdge. The segment information for fiscal 2003 and 2002 below reflect
this organizational change. Future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the business segments disclosed. A description of the types of products and services provided by each operating segment follows.  Advent Investment Management is the Companys core business and derives
revenues from the development, marketing and sale of software products, data interfaces and related maintenance and services that automate, integrate and support certain mission critical functions of investment management organizations. MicroEdge
derives revenues from the sale of software and services for grant management, matching gifts and volunteer tracking for the grantmaking community worldwide.  Segment Data  The results of the operating segments are derived directly from Advents internal management reporting system. The accounting policies used to derive
operating segment results are substantially the same as those used by the consolidated company. Management measures the performance of each operating segment based on several metrics, including income loss from operations. These results are used,
in part, to evaluate the performance of, and to assign resources to, each of the operating segments. Certain operating expenses, including amortization and impairment of developed technology and other intangibles, which Advent manages separately at
the corporate level, are not allocated to the operating segments. Advent does not separately accumulate and review asset information by segment.

Companys stock repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of up to an additional 18 million shares of common stock.  From January 1, 2005 through March 10, 2005, Advent repurchased 21 million shares under its current common stock repurchase plan for a total cost of $38
million and an average price of $1787 per share.  On March 8,
2005 certain of the former shareholders and the shareholders representative of Kinexus filed suit against Advent in the Delaware Chancery Court. The complaint alleges that Advent breached the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of December
31, 2001 pursuant to which Advent acquired all of the outstanding shares of Kinexus due principally to the fact that no amount was paid by Advent on an earn-out of up to $115million. The earn-out, which was payable in cash or stock at the
election of Advent, was based upon Kinexus meeting certain revenue targets in both 2002 and 2003. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, an accounting and restitution for unjust enrichment. Advent advised the shareholders
representative in January 2003 that the earn-out terms had not been met in 2002 and accordingly that no earn-out was payable for 2002 and would not be payable for 2003. Advent disputes the plaintiffs claims and believes that it has meritorious
defenses and counterclaims and intends to vigorously defend this action. Management believes that any potential loss associated with this litigation is neither probable nor reasonably estimable at this time and accordingly has not accrued any
amounts for any potential loss.  On April 6, 2005, the NASDAQ
Listing Qualifications Department the Nasdaq Staff notified Advent that the Company was not in compliance with the requirements of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4310c14 because it had not yet filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the period ended December 31, 2004 the 2004 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission as of April 5, 2005. Consequently, Advent common stock is subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Companys delay in
filing its 2004 10-K is the only listing deficiency cited by the Nasdaq Staff.

Advent intends to request an appeal hearing before a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel the
Panel to review the delisting determination. Under the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules, the delisting of Advents common stock will be stayed pending the Panels review and determination. Until the Panels ultimate
determination, the date of which is not yet known, Advent common shares will continue to be traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, but Advents trading symbol as of April 7, 2005, was amended from ADVS to ADVSE, to reflect
the Companys filing delinquency.

Effective January 1, 2004, we corrected our classification of revenue from our subsidiary, Second Street Securities, when they engage in the soft dollaring of third party products
or services. Revenues and cost of revenues for fiscal 2004 have been changed to reflect revenue recognition on a net basis from these transactions. As a result, we recorded reductions to net revenues of $11 million, $10 million and
$13million in the first, second and third quarters of 2004, respectively. These changes do not affect gross margin, operating loss, or net loss for any period presented. We have not changed revenues and cost of revenues in periods prior to
fiscal 2004 as the amounts were not material.  In addition, subsequent to our press release on February 1, 2005, we recorded corrections to our results of operations for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004. For the second quarter of 2004, we recorded a correction to incur an
additional non-cash restructuring charge of $09 million. Total restructuring charges for the second quarter were $59 million. As a result of the additional restructuring charges, we recorded reductions to depreciation expense of $36,000 and
$35,000 in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, respectively. For the fourth quarter of 2004, we also recorded an adjustment to rent expense of $354,000 to properly account for a rent holiday associated with an operating lease. These corrections
resulted in a restatement to our results of operations for the second and third quarters of 2004. See Note 2, Restatement of Financial Statements, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.  The following is a summary of the effect of these corrections on the

Our quarterly results of operations for 2004 included the operating results of Advent United Kingdom and Switzerland, subsequent to their acquisition in May of 2004. 3
In the third quarter of 2004, we recorded an impairment charge of $34 million to write-off our Techfi-related intangible assets resulting from our decision to sunset certain
products within our Techfi product line. 4
In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded impairment charges totaling $21 million. This amount included $14 million and $07 million to write off the carrying value of Advent
Hellas and Advent Wealth Services AWS intangible assets, respectively, as a result of significant underperformance by Advent Hellas and AWS relative to historical and projected future operating results as well as our decision to re-focus our
strategic direction on our core businesses. 5
Subsequent to our press release in January 2004, we reached a settlement involving a claim with a former employee in February 2004. As a result of this settlement, we recorded a
receivable of $775,000 and a corresponding reduction in general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2003. We also recorded corrections to reduce our income tax provision by a net $46 million for the fourth quarter of 2003. This
amount included $58 million to reduce our valuation allowance, offset by $12 million to accrue additional state tax liabilities. These corrections resulted in a restatement to our results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2003. See Note 2,
Restatement of Financial Statements, for additional information.  The following is a summary of the effect of these changes on the Companys consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 in thousands:  Quarter ended December 31, 2003

of disclosure controls and procedures  The Companys
management evaluated, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15f of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that because of the material weaknesses in internal
control over financial reporting identified in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing on page 53, our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of December 31, 2004, to ensure that information we
are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. 
Changes in internal control over financial reporting  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting which
was identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15e of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2004 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
controls over financial reporting.  See Managements
