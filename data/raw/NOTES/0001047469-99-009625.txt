INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Big City Radio, Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Big City
Radio, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity deficit and cash
flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 1998. In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also
have audited Schedule II, Valuation and Qualifying Accounts for the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996. These consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. These standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Big City
Radio, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three year
period ended December 31, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.

BIG CITY RADIO, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1997 AND 1998
1 ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS
Big City Radio, Inc. formerly Odyssey Communications, Inc. Big City
Radio was incorporated in Delaware on August 2, 1994 and commenced operations
on January 1, 1995. On May 30, 1996, Big City Radio merged with Q Broadcasting,
Inc. Q, and together with Big City Radio, the Company, with Big City Radio
being the surviving company. Big City Radio and Q were owned 94% and 100% by
Stuart and Anita Subotnick the Principal Stockholders. Accordingly, the
merger has been accounted for as a combination of entities under common control.
As a result, the combination of Big City Radio and Q was effected utilizing
historical costs. At the date of conversion from S Corporation status to C
Corporation status see Note 2, the Company formed five wholly owned
subsidiaries, Big City Radio--LA, LLC; Big City Radio--NYC, LLC; Big City
Radio--CHI, LLC; WRKL Rockland Radio, LLC; and Odyssey Traveling Billboards,
Inc.
The Company owns and operates radio broadcasting stations. As of December
31, 1998, the Company owned three FM stations in Southern California, KLYY-FM
Arcadia, KVYY-FM Ventura and KSYY-FM Fallbrook programmed as Y-107 LA. In
the New York area, the Company owns five radio properties, WWXY-FM Westchester
County, New York and WRKL-AM New City, New York the Original New York
Stations and WWZY-FM Monmouth, New Jersey and WWVY-FM Hampton Bays, New York
and WWYY-FM Hackettstown, New Jersey. WWXY-FM, WWZY-FM, WWVY-FM, and WWYY-FM are
programmed as New Country Y-107. In the Chicago area, the Company owns six
radio properties, WXXY-FM Highland Park, Illinois and WYXX-FM Morris, Illinois
programmed as FM 1031 and WKIE-FM Arlington Heights, Illinois, WKIF-FM
Kankakee, Illinois, and WDEK-FM DeKalb, Illinois programmed as 92 KISS FM
and WLBK-AM DeKalb, Illinois.
Since inception, the Company has incurred substantial losses and has never
generated positive cash flows from operations. The Company recent purchases
and reformatting of radio stations in its markets are currently contributing to
the Company losses. The Company believes that losses will continue while the
Company pursues its strategy of acquiring and developing radio stations. In
March 1998, the Company successfully completed the offering the Note
Offering of $174,000,000 aggregate principal amount at maturity of the
Company 11 1/4% Senior Discount Notes due 2005 the Notes, see Note 7. The
net proceeds of approximately $125,400,000 from this offering were used to repay
approximately $32,800,000 of the Old Credit Facility as hereinafter defined;
see Note 7. Simultaneously with the completion of the Note Offering, the
Company obtained a revolving credit facility the Revolving Credit Facility
with The Chase Manhattan Bank Chase in the amount of $15 million see Note
7. The Company believes the proceeds from the Note Offering, together with the
Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to permit it to acquire, develop
and operate new and existing properties through at least December 31, 1999.
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
In connection with the merger discussed in Note 1, Big City Radio and Q are
deemed to be combined since inception for financial reporting purposes. Big City
Radio reports on the basis of a December 31 year-end and Q reported on the basis
of a September 30 year-end. As a result, the December 31, 1996 financial
statements include the operations of Q on the basis of an eight-month period
ended May 30, 1996 the date of sale of the Q Stations.

BIG CITY RADIO, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1997 AND 1998
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Big City Radio, Inc. and all its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash equivalents of $51 million with maturities less than three months were
included in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 1998.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
Marketable securities at December 31, 1998 consist of U.S. Treasury,
mortgage-backed, corporate debt securities. The Company classifies its debt
securities as available-for-sale. Securities are recorded at fair value with the
unrealized holding gain or loss, net of the related tax effect, excluded from
earnings and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income
until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale
securities are determined on a specific identification basis. As of December 31,
1998, there were no material unrealized holding gains or losses. Proceeds from
the sale of securities were $772 million in 1998. Gross realized gains and
losses were immaterial in 1998.
A decline in the market value of any available-for-sale security below cost
that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in carrying
amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis
for the security is established. Premiums and discounts are amortized or
accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using
the effective interest method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when
earned.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from
5 to 7 years for transmission equipment, vehicles and furniture and office
equipment to 39 years for buildings and leasehold improvements over the lesser
of the useful life or the term of the lease.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected
to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed
of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to
sell.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets include the portion of the purchase price allocable to FCC
broadcast licenses, which are amortized on a straight-line method over 40 years.
Covenants not to compete, signed as part of station acquisition agreements, are
amortized over the period of the agreements, generally three years.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1997 AND 1998
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
It is the Company policy to account for intangible assets at the lower of
amortized cost or fair market value. As part of an ongoing review of the
valuation and amortization of intangible assets, management assesses the
carrying value of the Company intangible assets if facts and circumstances
suggest that they are impaired. If this review indicates that the intangibles
will not be recoverable as determined by a non-discounted cash flow analysis
over the remaining amortization period, the carrying value of the Company
intangibles will be reduced to their estimated realizable value. The Company has
determined that intangibles are fairly stated at December 31, 1998.
DEFERRED FINANCING FEES
Deferred finance costs and loan origination fees are amortized over the
period of the relevant facility.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Broadcasting revenue is recognized when commercials are aired. Net revenues
represent gross revenues, less direct fees and commissions paid to independent
advertising agencies.
INCOME TAXES
The Company previously elected to be treated as an S Corporation for federal
and certain state income tax purposes. As an S Corporation, the earnings and
losses of the Company were reported by the individual stockholders, and the
Company was not responsible for federal or certain state income taxes. The
Company terminated its S Corporation election effective October 1, 1997.
Accordingly, no provision for income taxes is included in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 1996.
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

DECEMBER 31, 1997 AND 1998
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair value
disclosures for financial instruments:
The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, current
receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value.
The carrying value of the long-term debt approximates fair value because it
is a floating rate instrument. The carrying value and fair value of Senior
Discount Notes are $1368 million and $1138 million, respectively, at December
31, 1998. Fair values of Senior Discount Notes are based on market prices.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentration
of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable. The Company believes
that concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable, which are
unsecured, are limited due to the Company ongoing relationship with its
clients. The Company provides for its estimate of uncollectible accounts on a
periodic basis. The Company has not experienced significant losses relating to
accounts receivable. For periods ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, no
customer accounted for more than 10% of revenues.

The Company trades commercial air time for goods and services used
principally for promotional, sales and other business activities. An asset and a
liability are recorded at the fair market value of the goods or services
received. Barter revenue is recorded and the liability is relieved when the
commercials are broadcast, and barter expense is recorded and the assets are
relieved when the goods or services are received or used.
ADVERTISING
The Company charges advertising costs, as incurred, to expense. Advertising
costs amounted to $550,000, $1,275,000 and $1,484,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per
Share, is effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after
December 15, 1997. SFAS No. 128 replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion
APB No. 15 and simplifies the computation of earnings per share EPS by
replacing the presentation of primary EPS with a presentation of basic EPS and
diluted EPS. Basic EPS includes no dilution and is computed by dividing income
available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution from
securities that could share in the earnings of the Company, similar to fully
diluted EPS under APB No. 15. In calculating diluted EPS, no potential shares of
common stock are to be included in the computation when a loss from continuing
operations available to common stockholders exists. The statement requires dual
presentation of basic and diluted EPS by entities with complex capital
structures. The Company adopted SFAS No. 128 for the financial statements ended
December 31, 1997 and 1998.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Stock options issued under the Company 1997 and 1998 Incentive Stock Plan
amounting to 572,500 and 963,550 at December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively,
were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because to do so would have
been antidilutive.
ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK OPTIONS
On January 1, 1996, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which
permits entities to recognize as expense over the vesting period the fair value
of all stock-based awards on the date of grant. Alternatively, SFAS No. 123
allows entities to continue to apply the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and
provide pro forma net income and disclosure for employee stock option grants
made in 1995, 1996 and future years as if the fair-value-based method defined in
SFAS No. 123 had been applied. The Company has elected to continue to apply the
provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and provide the pro forma disclosure provisions
of SFAS No. 123.
REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income. This statement, which establishes standards for reporting and
disclosure of comprehensive income, is effective for interim and annual periods
beginning after December 15, 1997, although earlier adoption is permitted.
Reclassification of financial information for earlier periods presented for
comparative purposes is required under SFAS No. 130. The Company adopted SFAS
No. 130 effective January 1, 1998. Adoption had no impact on the Company
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

$1254 million. They mature on March 15, 2005. The Notes will accrete in value
until March 15, 2001 at a rate of 1125% per annum, compounded semiannually, to
an aggregate principal amount of $1740 million. Cash interest will not accrue
on the Notes prior to March 15, 2001. Thereafter, interest on the Notes will

7 SENIOR DISCOUNT NOTES CONTINUED
original principal amount of the Notes with net cash proceeds of one or more
Equity Offerings received by the Company so long as there is a public market for
the Company Class A Common Stock at the time of such redemption, at a
redemption price equal to 11125% of the accreted value thereof to be redeemed,
to the date of redemption; provided that at least 66 2/33% of the original
principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding immediately after each such
redemption. The Notes are not subject to any sinking fund requirement. Upon a
Change of Control as such term is defined in the Notes, each holder of Notes
has the right to require the Company to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a
price equal to 101% of the accreted value of such Notes prior to March 15, 2001,
or 101% of the principal amount of such Notes thereafter, together with accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of the purchase.
The Notes are unsecured, senior obligations of the Company and rank PARI
PASSU in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness of the
Company and senior to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the
Company. The Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the
Company subsidiaries. The indenture does not restrict the ability of the
Company or its subsidiaries to create, acquire or capitalize subsidiaries in the
future. The Notes will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future
indebtedness of the Company subsidiaries. Approximately $46 million of costs
associated with the issuance of the Notes, including the underwriters fees and
related professional fees are included in deferred financing fees and will be
amortized over the term of the Notes.
Simultaneously with the consummation of the Notes, the Company entered into
the Revolving Credit Facility providing for up to $15 million of availability.
The Revolving Credit Facility matures on the fifth anniversary of the issue date
and amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at an
applicable margin plus, at the Company option, Chase prime rate in which
case the applicable margin is 200% subject to reduction upon obtaining
performance criteria based on the Company leverage ratio or the London
Inter-Bank Borrowing Rate in which case the applicable margin is 300% subject
to reduction upon obtaining performance criteria based on the Company leverage
ratio. The Company obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are
secured by a pledge of substantially all of the Company and its subsidiaries'
assets. The Company will pay fees of 5% per annum, on the aggregate unused
portion of the facility. Upon entering into the Revolving Credit Facility, the
Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of the Old Credit Facility which
consisted of the unamortized deferred financing fees of $582,000. This expense
is reported, net of its tax effect of $87,000, as an extraordinary loss in the
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 1998.
The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain financial and operational
covenants and other restrictions with which the Company must comply, including,
among others, limitations on capital expenditures, the incurrence of additional
indebtedness, restrictions on sale of assets, restrictions on the use of
borrowings, limitations on paying cash dividends and redeeming or repurchasing
capital stock of the Company or the Notes, and requirements to maintain certain
financial ratios, maximum total leverage, minimum interest coverage and minimum
fixed charge coverage. As of December 31, 1998 no amounts were drawn down on the
Revolving Credit Facility. However, a $509,000 letter of credit related to the
Century City office lease was issued under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary events of default,
including material misrepresentations, payment defaults and default in the
performance of other covenants, certain bankruptcy and ERISA defaults, judgment
and cross defaults and revocation of any of the Company broadcast licenses.
The Revolving Credit Facility also provides that an event of default will occur
upon the occurrence of a change of control. For purposes of the Revolving
Credit Facility, a change of control will occur when i any person or group
other than the Principal Stockholders and their affiliates obtains the power to
elect a majority of the Board of Directors, ii the Company fails to own 100%
of the capital stock of its subsidiaries owning any of the FCC broadcast
licenses or iii the Board of Directors does not consist of a majority of

SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS
Pursuant to the terms of the indenture with respect to the Notes the
Indenture the direct subsidiaries of Big City Radio, Inc.--consisting of
Odyssey Traveling Billboards, Inc., Big City Radio-- NYC, L.L.C., Big City
Radio--LA, L.L.C., Big City Radio--CHI, L.L.C., and WRKL Rockland Radio, L.L.C.
collectively, the Subsidiary Guarantors--have, jointly and severally, fully
and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of Big City Radio, Inc. with
respect to the Notes.
All of the Subsidiary Guarantors except Odyssey Traveling Billboards, Inc.
the Station Subsidiaries, were created in December 1997 as special purpose
Delaware limited liability companies formed at the request of the lenders under
the Credit Facility for the sole purpose of facilitating the Credit Facility by
holding the Company Federal Communications Commission FCC radio licenses.
The operating agreements for the Station subsidiaries limit the activities of
these companies to holding the FCC radio licenses. Odyssey Traveling Billboards,
Inc. Odyssey owns and operates certain vehicles used to advertise for the
Company radio stations. Because the Station Subsidiaries have entered into
assignment and use agreements with the Company whereby the Company manages and
directs the day-to-day operations of the radio stations, pays all expenses and
capital costs incurred in operating the radio stations, and retains all
advertising and other receipts collected in operating the radio stations, the
Station Subsidiaries have no income or expenses other than the amortization of
the FCC licenses. Odyssey is similarly a special purpose corporation with no
income and only expenses.
The covenants in the Notes, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility
do not restrict the ability of the Station Subsidiaries to make cash
distributions to the Company.
Accordingly, set forth below is certain summarized financial information
within the meaning of Section 1-02bb of Regulation S-X for the Subsidiary
Guarantors, as of December 31, 1997 and 1998 and

9 LONG-TERM DEBT
On May 30, 1996, the Company entered into a credit agreement as amended,
the Old Credit Facility with Chase. The Old Credit Facility provided revolving
credit commitments in the form of loans and/or letters of credit in an aggregate
principal amount of $40 million. A significant portion of the debt was
guaranteed by a Principal Stockholder. This facility was subsequently amended in
November 1996, May 1997 and August 1997 to primarily change the available
borrowings.
On December 24, 1997, following the initial public offering of the Company
Class A Common Stock, the Old Credit Facility was substantially amended to
comprise a new $35 million reducing revolving facility. Outstanding amounts
under the Old Credit Facility as so amended bore interest at a rate based, at
the option of the Company, on the participating bank prime rate, plus 15% to
20% or the London Inter-Bank Borrowing Rate, plus 25% to 30%, except for
guaranteed amounts which bear interest at 1% less. A Principal Stockholder of
the Company had guaranteed $6 million of the outstanding amounts. As
consideration for agreeing to the amendment of the Old Credit Agreement, the
Company paid financing fees of $612,000. These fees were to be amortized over
the period of the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Company agreed to pay a
commitment fee quarterly equal to 05% per annum on the average unused available
credit. Upon entering into the Old Credit Facility as so amended, the Company
recorded a loss on extinguishment of the Old Credit Facility as in effect prior
to such amendment which consisted of the existing unamortized deferred financing
fees of $513,000. This expense is reported, net of its tax effect of $200,000,
as an extraordinary loss in the consolidated statement of operations for the
year ended December 31, 1997.
The interest rates for the guaranteed and non-guaranteed portions of the Old
Credit Facility as of December 31, 1997 were 89% and 99%, respectively.
Interest expense on the above facilities for the years ended December 31, 1996,
1997, and 1998 was $1,794,000, $3,547,000, and $576,000, respectively.
The Old Credit Facility contained certain financial and operational
covenants and other restrictions with which the Company had to comply,
including, among others, limitations on capital expenditures, the incurrence of
additional indebtedness, restrictions on the use of borrowings, limitations on
paying cash dividends and redeeming or repurchasing capital stock of the
Company, and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios. The Company was
also prohibited from making acquisitions without the prior consent of Chase. All
of the Company obligations under the Old Credit Facility were secured by a
first priority security interest in all of the Company tangible and intangible
property and assets.
In March 1998, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding under the Old
Credit Facility see Note 7.

The Company has approximately $14,562,000 of net operating loss
carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes. These NOLs begin to expire in
2017.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers
projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this
assessment. At December 31, 1998, based on projections for future taxable income
over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management
believes that it is unlikely that the Company will realize the benefits of these
deductible differences. Accordingly, a valuation allowance of $5,571,000 has
been provided for the deferred tax assets for the year ended December 31, 1998.

Prior to January 1, 1996, the Company accounted for its stock option plan in
accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board APB Option No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. As
such, compensation expense would be recorded on the date of grant only if the
current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price. On
January 1, 1996, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, which permits entities to recognize as expense over the vesting
period the fair value of all stock-based awards on the date of grant.
Alternatively, SFAS No. 123 also allows entities to continue to apply the
provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and provide pro forma net income and pro forma
earnings per share disclosures for employee stock option grants made in 1995 and
future years as if the fair-value-based method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been
applied. The Company has elected to continue to apply the provisions of APB
Opinion No. 25 in accounting for its Plan, and accordingly, no compensation cost
has been recognized for its stock options granted at fair market value in the
consolidated financial statements. Compensation cost will be recorded for
options granted below fair market value.
In 1996, the Company did not grant any stock options nor did it have any
previously granted options outstanding. Accordingly, for 1996, there would have
been no pro forma impact on earnings had SFAS

determined compensation cost based on the fair value at the grant date for its
stock options under SFAS No. 123, the Company net income would have been
reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

stock options granted was $483 on the date of grant using the modified
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions: expected dividend yield of 0%, risk-free interest rate of 557 expected volatility of 50% and an expected life of 10 years.
