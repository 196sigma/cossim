NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2005 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
MITY Enterprises, Inc. the Company designs and manufactures multipurpose
room furniture and healthcare seating and markets these products in niche
markets. In addition, the Company continues to pursue acquisitions of product
lines or companies that will be complementary to the Company businesses.
The Company markets its products throughout the United States, Canada and in
certain foreign countries.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
During the quarter ended June 30, 2001, the Company developed and approved a
plan for exiting and selling the specialty office seating and systems
furniture segment of its operations. This segment consists of the CenterCore
and DO Group businesses. As a result of these actions, the Company has
treated DO Group and CenterCore as a discontinued operation. On November 8,
2002, the Company completed the sale of the assets of the specialty office
seating and systems furniture segment of its operations See Note 5,
Discontinued Operations.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of
MITY Enterprises, Inc. and all wholly owned and partially owned subsidiaries
for which the Company exercises control. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments which have an
original maturity not greater than three months.
AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES
Debt securities, which consist of corporate bonds and government agency
securities, are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at their
fair value. When the fair value of available-for-sale securities differs from
the amortized cost, the resulting unrealized gain or loss is recorded as a
component of comprehensive income. The amortization of premiums and discounts
on debt securities in this category are included in investment income and
reflected in the net carrying amount of the debt securities. The cost of
securities sold during the period is based on the specific identification
method. Interest on securities in this category are included in investment
income. As of March 31, 2005, the Company had unrealized holding losses on
available-for-sale securities of $19,000. These losses were related to
fluctuations in interest rates and are not considered to be other than a
temporary loss.  As of March 31, 2004 there were no unrealized holding gains
or losses on available-for-sale securities.
The contractual maturities of the available-for-sale securities held are
summarized below 45

arose from its acquisitions of Broda Enterprises and Versipanel and the other
intangible asset is represented by intellectual property related to certain
rights the Company obtained to utilize new technology in its next generation
table product development efforts. During the quarter ended June 30, 2004,
the Company reviewed the goodwill related to the Broda acquisition and the
intellectual property related to the other intangible asset and determined at
that time that there was no impairment. This review is performed using
estimates of future cash flows. If the carrying value of the intangible asset
is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by
which the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value.
However, due to the decision by the board of directors in January 2005 to
discontinue the next generation table project, the Company has fully impaired
the other intangible assets related to the intellectual property during the
quarter ending March 31, 2005. This resulted in an impairment charge of
$227,000 related to the other intangible assets See Note 4, Impairment of
Assets.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin
SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition, as revised by SAB No. 104. Sales are
recorded when title passes and collectability is reasonably assured under its
various shipping terms. Revenue is normally recognized upon shipment of goods
to customers. In certain circumstances revenue is not recognized until the
goods are received by the customer based on the terms of the sale agreement.
Discounts directly related to the sale are recorded as a reduction to net
sales.
SHIPPING COSTS
In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 00-10, Accounting for
Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs, the Company classifies shipping costs
billed to customers as revenue.
47
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and cash equivalents.
In the normal course of business, the Company provides credit terms to its
customers. Accordingly, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of
its customers and maintains allowances for possible losses which, when
realized, have been within the range of management expectations.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value. The carrying amount
reported in the balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, and accounts payable approximates fair value because of the
immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.
INCOME TAXES
The Company uses an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and
reporting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary
differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as reported for financial
statement purposes and income tax purposes.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 148, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123 which provides alternative methods of transition for a
voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure
requirements of Statement No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both
annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on
reported results. SFAS No. 148 is effective for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2002 and for financial reports containing financial statements
for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The Company has
decided to continue applying Accounting Principle Board APB Statement No. 25
as permitted by SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148. The required disclosure of
the effects of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148 are included in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been
recognized for its stock option plans. Had compensation cost of the Company
two stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at
the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with SFAS No. 123, the
Company net income and earnings per share would have changed to the pro
forma amounts indicated below 48

USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates
subject to change include the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, the
reserve for obsolete inventory, accruals for warranty expense, goodwill and
intangible assets, reserve on notes receivable, litigation reserves, and
valuation of the discontinued operations and the assets related to its
discontinued next generation table line see Note 4, Impairment of Assets.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
On April 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS
No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, but retains its fundamental provision
for recognizing and measuring impairment of long-lived assets to be held and
used. This Statement requires that all long-lived assets to be disposed of by
sale be carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to
sell, and that depreciation cease to be recorded on such assets. Fair market
value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a
rate commensurate with the risk involved. Long-lived assets to be disposed of
other than by sale are considered held and used until disposed of. SFAS No.
144 standardizes the accounting and presentation requirements for all
long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, and supersedes previous guidance
for discontinued operations of business segments. Due to the decision by the
board of directors in January 2005 to discontinue the next generation table
project, the Company has impaired certain long-term assets during the quarter
ending March 31, 2005. This resulted in an impairment charge of $22 million,
including $20 million related to fixed assets and $02 million related to
other intangible assets See Note 4, Impairment of Assets. There were no
long-lived assets which were considered impaired as of March 31, 2004.
49
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
The Company comprehensive income consists of foreign currency adjustments,
unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, and net
income.
ACCRUED WARRANTY
The Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time
revenue is recognized. This warranty obligation is affected by failure rates,
the introduction of new products, and the costs of material and labor to
repair or replace the product. The Company regularly assesses the adequacy of
its accrual for warranty expense based upon historical warranty rates and
anticipated future warranty rates. Activity associated with the accrued
warranty is as follows Year Ended March 31,             2005     2004     2003
Balance at beginning of period      $415,000   $365,000   $375,000

Balance at end of period         $439,000   $415,000   $365,000
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT
The financial statements of the Company foreign subsidiary is measured using
the Canadian dollar as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are
translated into U.S. dollars at year-end rates of exchange and results of
operations are translated at average rates for the year. Gains and losses
resulting from these translations are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted effect of all common shares
issued and outstanding, and is calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted average shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
common shares used in the basic earnings per share calculation plus the number
of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise or conversion of all
potentially dilutive common shares outstanding. The Company excludes equity
instruments from the calculation of diluted weighted average shares
outstanding if the effect of including such instruments is antidilutive to
earnings per share. The following table sets forth the computation of basic
and diluted earnings per share for each of the past three fiscal years 50

RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year amounts to conform
to the 2005 classifications.
RECENTLY ISSUED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment,
which replaces SFAS no. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and
supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
SFAS No. 123R eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value
measurement provisions of Opinion 25 to stock compensation awards issued to
employees. Rather, the new standard requires enterprises to measure the cost
of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost will be recognized
over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in
exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period usually the
vesting period.
The Company has not yet quantified the effects of the adoption of SFAS 123R,
but it is expected that the new standard will result in significant
stock-based compensation expense. The pro forma effects on net income and
earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition
provisions of original SFAS 123 on stock compensation awards rather than
applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of Opinion 25 are
disclosed above. Although such pro forma effects of applying original SFAS
123 may be indicative of the effects of adopting SFAS 123R, the provisions of
these two statements differ in some important respects. The actual effects of
adopting SFAS 123R will be dependent on numerous factors including, but not
limited to, the valuation model chosen by the Company to value stock-based
awards; the assumed award forfeiture rate; the accounting policies adopted
concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the
requisite service period; and the transition method as described below
chosen for adopting SFAS 123R.
51
SFAS 123R, as amended by the SEC, will be effective for the Company fiscal
year beginning April 1, 2006, and requires the use of the Modified Prospective
Application Method. Under this method, SFAS 123R is applied to new awards and
to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the effective date.
Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the
requisite service has not been rendered such as unvested options that are
outstanding as of the date of adoption shall be recognized as the remaining
requisite services are rendered. The compensation cost relating to unvested
awards at the date of adoption shall be based on the grant-date fair value of
those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original SFAS
123. In addition, companies may use the Modified Retrospective Application
Method. This method may be applied to all prior years for which the original
SFAS 123 was effective or only to prior interim periods in the year of initial
adoption. If the Modified Retrospective Application Method is applied,
financial statements for prior periods shall be adjusted to give effect to the
fair-value-based method of accounting for awards on a consistent basis with
the pro forma disclosures required for those periods under the original SFAS
123.
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs. SFAS No.
151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to
clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs, and wasted material. SFAS No. 151 requires that those items be
recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the
criterion of so abnormal. In addition, this Statement requires that
allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based
on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company intends
to adopt SFAS No. 151 on April 1, 2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial
statements.
In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, FIN No. 46 an interpretation of ARB No. 51.
FIN No. 46, as amended, addresses consolidation by business enterprises of
variable interest entities. FIN No. 46 applies immediately to variable
interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and to variable interest
entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. FIN No.
46 applies in the first year or interim period ending after December 15, 2003
to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest
that it acquired before February 1, 2003. The Company does not have an
interest in any variable interest entity and therefore the adoption of FIN No.
46 did not impact the consolidated financial statements.
In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liability and Equity, which
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain
financial instruments with characteristics of both liability and equity in its
statement of financial position. SFAS No. 150 is effective for new or
modified financial instruments beginning June 1, 2003, and for existing
instruments beginning August 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not
have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.
52
In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which amends and clarifies
accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS
No. 133. SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified
after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30,
2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not have an impact on our consolidated
financial statements.
2. INVENTORIES
Inventories consisted of the following March 31,                      2005      2004
Materials and supplies            $ 1,522,000  $ 1,486,000

$ 2,518,000  $ 2,339,000
3. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment consisted of the following March 31,                      2005      2004
Land and improvements            $ 2,179,000  $ 2,179,000

$11,714,000  $13,230,000
4. IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS
During a meeting of the Company Board of Directors on January 25, 2005, the
board decided to discontinue funding the Company initiative to develop its
next generation table. The decision was made based on the difficulties
encountered and additional expenses required to achieve a consistent,
repeatable manufacturing process. At this time, the decision was also made to
redirect some of the resources previously focused on the next generation table
project towards using the same technology and equipment for other products
that do not require the same level of precision as tables. However, the
Company is in the process of developing a specific plan for the use of these
assets and can give no assurance that it will be successful in its efforts.
53
As a result, during the quarter ending March 31, 2005, in accordance with SFAS
No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment of Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the
Company realized an impairment on some of the assets involved in that project
to reduce their carrying amounts to their estimated fair value. As per SFAS
No. 144, the fair value was determined by the amount at which the assets could
be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties. The
Company utilized an outside specialist to establish the fair value of the
assets. The impairment totaled $2,226,000 and consisted of $1,999,000 in
impairment of fixed assets and $227,000 in impairment of other intangible
asset.
In connection with the decision to discontinue the next generation table line,
it was determined that the the value of the inventory associated with the
project was less than its cost. So, in accordance with Accounting Research
Bulletin 43 ARB 43, paragraph 5, this inventory was revalued at market value
through a reserve which resulted in an adjustment down in the value of
inventory of $324,000. This charge was included in the cost of products sold.
The fair value of the assets previously associated with the next generation
table project that will now be redirected on other processes, consists of
$2,528,000 in building, $1,045,000 for equipment, and $272,000 in inventory.
The Company believes that it will be able to fully realize the value of these
assets.
5. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In November 2002, the Company completed its plan for exiting and selling the
assets of the specialty office seating and systems segment of its business
the CenterCore and DO Group businesses. This plan was originally approved
by the Company Board of Directors in June 2001. Since that time and in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting
the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of
a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions, the Company treated the DO Group and CenterCore segment of its
operations as a discontinued operation. At the time that the plan was
originally formulated, an estimated $3,256,000 loss was accrued for in the
three months ended June 30, 2001 to account for the expected losses on
disposal and estimated operating losses through the disposal date. After the
completion of the plan, the actual net loss, after tax was determined to be
$2,511,000. Since the amount of loss that was originally estimated and
accrued for in the June 2001 quarter of $3,256,000 was higher than this
amount, the Company recognized a gain, net of tax, of $745,000, in the three
month period ended December 31, 2002. The sale of the assets of this segment
was completed in three transactions. The first two transactions took place in
September and October 2001. The final transaction occurred in November 2002.

6. NOTES RECEIVABLE AND INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARY
In 2002, the Company acquired a 50 percent interest in a startup development
company. On September 30, 2004, the Company sold its 50 percent equity
ownership interest in the startup development company to the other 50 percent
owner. The Company exchanged its ownership interest for an exclusive license
for furniture products and selected other products, release of all royalty
obligations on existing and future products, and other considerations. The
Company retained most of the tangible assets and liabilities of the startup
development company including cash, inventory, fixed assets, and accounts
payable. Due to the decision by the board of directors in January 2005 to
discontinue funding the Company initiative to develop its next generation
table, the Company has impaired certain of the remaining assets See Note 4,
Impairment of Assets.
During the quarter ended March 31, 2002, the Company entered into an agreement
with a dealer for the Company multipurpose room furniture in Australia and
created a note receivable for $365,000. This note, which bears interest at
the prime rate, requires monthly payments of interest and principal in the
amount of $6,000 and is being amortized over a six and one half year period.
The note is secured by all of the assets of the dealership and by personal
guarantees from the principals of the dealership. The Company has a reserve
of $20,000 and $150,000, for this note receivable as of March 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively. At March 31, 2005 and 2004, the gross value of this
note receivable was $159,000 and $248,000, respectively. At March 31, 2005 54,000 was the current portion of this note receivable, which is included in
prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of March 31, 2005, the dealer
was current on payments on this note receivable.
7. LINE OF CREDIT
The Company wholly-owned subsidiary, Broda Enterprises, had a line of
credit, bearing interest at Canadian prime 425 percent at March 31, 2005
which is secured by a General Security Agreement, an assignment of insurance
and guarantees by the Company. The limit on this line is $822,000. At March
31, 2005 and 2004, no balance was outstanding. Among other restrictions, this
credit facility requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios and
levels of working capital. As of March 31, 2005, the Company was in full
compliance with the loan covenants related to this credit facility.
8. ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following March 31,                      2005      2004
Accrued payroll and payroll taxes      $ 1,155,000  $ 1,236,000

9. COMMON STOCK OPTIONS
At March 31, 2005, the Company has two stock incentive plans, the 1990 Stock
Option Plan the 1990 Plan and the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan the 1997
Plan. The Company authorized and reserved 750,000 shares of common stock
for issuance under the 1990 Plan and 900,000 shares of common stock for
issuance under the 1997 Plan. The purchase price for the shares under the
Plans is equal to the fair value of the common stock at the date the options
are granted as determined by the closing price listed on the Nasdaq Stock
Exchange except for shareholders holding more than ten percent of the
outstanding stock, whose options are issued at a ten percent premium to the
then current market value. A table of stock option activity is shown below                  Number      Weighted Average

under an operating lease which expires in August 2005.  The current agreement
requires lease payments of $16,000 Canadian approximately US $13,000 per

The Company has certain alleged obligations of up to $04 million related to a
defined benefit pension plan and $02 million related to a wage dispute
resulting from exiting and selling its specialty office seating and systems
business. The Company does not believe that it is liable for these amounts and
plans to vigorously defend its positions. At this time, the Company is unable
to determine what its liability will be.
The Company has been named as defendant in certain lawsuits. While the
Company cannot predict the results of these actions, management believes,
based in part on the advice of legal counsel, that the liability, if any,
resulting from such litigation and claims will not have a material affect on
the consolidated financial statements.

On April 1, 2004, the Company announced the acquisition of the assets of
Versipanel LLC, a privately-owned designer, manufacturer and marketer of a
variety of portable partitions based in Phoenix, Arizona. The transaction was

included the operating results of Versipanel in the financial statements from
