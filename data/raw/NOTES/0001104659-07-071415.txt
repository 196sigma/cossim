32 REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
United Natural Foods,Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of United Natural Foods,Inc. the Company as of July28,
2007 and July29, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the
three-year period ended July28, 2007. We also have audited the Companys
internal control over financial reporting as of July28, 2007, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The
Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements,
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of
internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of July28, 2007 and July29, 2006, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years
in the three-year period ended July28, 2007, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also
in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial  33 reporting as of July28,
2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
As
discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, effective August1,
2005, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123R, Share-Based Payment.

1SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
aNature of
Business
United Natural Foods,Inc.
and subsidiaries the Company is a distributor and retailer of natural and
organic products. The Company sells its products primarily throughout the
United States.
bBasis of
Presentation
The accompanying financial statements include the

intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
years presentation.
Effective August1, 2005, the Company changed the
fiscal periods in its fiscal year to end on the Saturday closest to July31.
As such, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 ended on July28, 2007 and July29,
2006, respectively, compared to fiscal 2005, which ended on July31, 2005.

customer volume discounts, returns and allowances. Net sales also consist of
amounts due to the Company from customers for shipping and handling, and fuel
surcharges. The principal components of cost of sales include the amount paid
to manufacturers and growers for product sold, plus the cost of transportation
necessary to bring the product to the Companys distribution facilities. Cost

received from suppliers are recorded as reductions in cost of sales upon the
sale of the related products.
eProperty
and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Equipment under capital leases is
stated at the lower of the present value of minimum lease payments at the
inception of the lease or the fair value of the asset. Depreciation and
amortization of property and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis,
over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, when applicable, the life of
the lease, whichever is shorter. Applicable interest charges incurred during
the  39 construction of new
facilities is capitalized as one of the elements of cost and is amortized over
the assets estimated useful lives. Interest capitalized for each of the years
ended July28, 2007, July29, 2006, and July31, 2005 was $02
million, $05 million and $05 million, respectively.

fIncome
Taxes
The Company accounts for
income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under the asset and
liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
gIntangible
Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets
Intangible assets consist principally of goodwill,
covenants not to compete, trademarks and tradenames. Goodwill represents the
excess purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with
purchase business combinations. Covenants not to compete are initially recorded
at fair value and are amortized using the straight-line method over the lives
of the respective agreements, generally three to five years. Trademarks and
tradenames are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized using the
straight-line method over their respective useful lives, if applicable. Trademarks
and tradenames that are determined to be indefinite lived are recorded at fair
value.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
requires that companies test goodwill for impairment at least annually and
between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more
likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
amount. The Company has elected to perform its annual tests for indications of
goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each year. Impairment losses
are determined based upon the excess of carrying amounts over discounted
expected future cash flows of the underlying business. The assessment of the
recoverability of long-lived assets will be impacted if estimated future cash
flows are not achieved. For reporting units that indicate potential impairment,
the Company determines the implied fair  40 value of that reporting
unit using a discounted cash flow analysis and compares such values to the
respective reporting units carrying amounts.
As of July28, 2007, the Companys annual assessment
of each of its reporting units indicated that no impairment of goodwill existed.
Total goodwill as of July28, 2007 was $799 million. The Company recorded
additional goodwill in the manufacturing division of approximately $18 million
during the year ended July28, 2007 due to the acquisitions of Organic
Brands LLC Organic Brands and other branded product lines.
Other intangibles consist of covenants not to compete
with a weighted average amortization period of 317 years and indefinite lived
trademarks and tradenames that are not subject to amortization. The Company had
covenants not to compete and related accumulated amortization of $07 million
and $04 million, respectively at July28, 2007, and $07 million and $05
million, respectively, at July29, 2006. The Company had trademarks and
tradenames of $83 million at July28, 2007. Amortization expense was $01
million, $06 million, and $07 million for the years ended July28, 2007,
July29, 2006, and July31, 2005, respectively.
Estimated
amortization expense for the next three fiscal years is as follows

hRevenue
Recognition and Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company records revenue upon delivery of products.
Revenues are recorded net of applicable sales discounts and estimated sales
returns. Sales incentives provided to customers are accounted for as reductions
in revenue as the related revenue is recorded. The Companys sales are primarily
with customers located throughout the United States.
In the year ended July28, 2007, one customer,
Whole Foods Market,Inc. Whole Foods Market generated 10% or more of
the Companys net sales. In the years ended July29, 2006 and July31,
2005, two customers, Whole Foods Market and Wild Oats Markets,Inc. Wild
Oats Markets, generated 10% or more of the Companys net sales. Net sales to
Whole Foods Market were approximately 28% of net sales in fiscal 2007 and
approximately 26% of net sales in fiscal 2006 and 2005. Wild Oats Markets
represented approximately 9%, 10% and 11% of net sales in fiscal 2007, 2006,
and 2005, respectively.
The Company analyzes
customer creditworthiness, accounts receivable balances, payment history,
payment terms and historical bad debt levels when evaluating the adequacy of
its allowance for doubtful accounts. In instances where a reserve has been
recorded for a particular customer, future sales to the customer are conducted
using either cash-on-delivery terms, or the account is closely monitored so
that as agreed upon payments are received, orders are released; a failure to
pay results in held or cancelled orders.
iFair Value
of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Companys financial
instruments including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these
instruments. The carrying value of notes receivable, long-term debt and capital
lease obligations are based on the instruments interest rate, terms, maturity
date and collateral, if any, in comparison to the Companys incremental
borrowing rate for similar financial instruments. 41 The
following estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the Company
using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to
develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented
herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could
realize in a current market exchange.

jUse of
Estimates
The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Due to the inherent
uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future
periods may be based upon amounts that differ from those estimates.
kNotes
Receivable, Trade
The Company issues trade
notes receivable to certain customers under two basic circumstances; inventory
purchases for initial store openings and overdue accounts receivable. Initial
store opening notes are generally receivable over a period not to exceed twelve
months. The overdue accounts receivable notes may extend for periods greater
than one year. All notes are issued at a market interest rate and contain
certain guarantees and collateral assignments in favor of the Company.
lShare-Based
Compensation
The Company adopted
Financial Accounting Standards Board the FASB SFAS No123 revised
2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R,
effective August1, 2005. SFAS 123Rrequires the recognition of the
fair value of share-based compensation in net income. The Company has three
share-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note
3. Share-based compensation consists of stock options and restricted stock
awards. Stock options are granted to employees at exercise prices equal to the
fair market value of the Companys stock at the dates of grant. Generally,
stock options and restricted stock granted to employees vest ratably over the
four years from the grant date. The Company recognizes share-based compensation
expense over the requisite service period of the individual grants, which
generally equals the vesting period. Prior to August1, 2005 the Company
accounted for these plans under the intrinsic value method described in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25 Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. Under
the intrinsic value method, no share-based compensation expense was reflected
in net income for stock option grants. For the effects on net income and
earnings per share, if the Company had applied the fair value recognition
provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, to share-based compensation, see Note 3. 42 mEarnings
Per Share
Basic
earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings
per share are calculated by adding the dilutive potential common shares to the
weighted average number of common shares that were outstanding during the
period. For purposes of the diluted earnings per share calculation, outstanding
stock options are considered common stock equivalents, using the treasury stock
method. A reconciliation of the weighted average number of shares outstanding
used in the computation of the basic and diluted earnings per share for all
periods presented follows

nComprehensive
Income
Components of other
comprehensive income include net income and certain transactions that have
generally been reported in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity.
Other comprehensive income is comprised of net income and the net change in
fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges.
oDerivative
Financial Instruments
The Company is exposed to
market risks arising from changes in interest rates and fuel costs. The Company
uses derivatives principally in the management of interest rate and fuel
exposure. The Company does not utilize derivatives that contain leverage
features. On the date on which the Company enters into a derivative
transaction, the derivative is designated as a hedge of the identified exposure.
The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments
and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for
undertaking the hedge transaction. In this documentation, the Company
specifically identifies the asset, liability, firm commitment, forecasted
transaction, or net investment that has been designated as the hedged item and
states how the hedging instrument is expected to reduce the risks related to
the hedged item. The Company measures effectiveness of its hedging
relationships both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis as needed.
pShipping
and Handling Fees and Costs
The Company includes shipping
and handling fees billed to customers in net sales. Shipping and handling costs
associated with inbound freight are generally recorded in cost of sales,
whereas shipping and handling costs for outbound freight are recorded in
operating expenses.
qReserves
for Self Insurance
The Company is primarily
self-insured for workers compensation, and general and automobile liability
insurance. It is the Companys policy to record the self-insured portion of
workers compensation and automobile liabilities based upon actuarial methods
to estimate the future cost of claims and related expenses that have been
reported but not settled, and that have been incurred but not yet reported. Any 43 projection
of losses concerning workers compensation and automobile liability is subject
to a considerable degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability
are unpredictable external factors affecting litigation trends, benefit level
changes and claim settlement patterns.
rOperating
Lease Expenses
The Company records lease
payments via the straight-line method and, for leases with step rent provisions
whereby the rental payments increase over the life of the lease, the Company
recognizes the total minimum lease payments on a straight-line basis over the
lease term.
sNew
Accounting Pronouncements
In July2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
FIN 48. FIN 48 prescribes detailed guidance for the financial statement
recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized
in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Tax positions must meet a
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be
recognized upon the adoption of FIN 48 and in subsequent periods. FIN 48 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006 and the
provisions of FIN 48 will be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption
of the Interpretation. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this
Interpretation will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of
retained earnings for that fiscal year. The Company will adopt FIN 48 in fiscal
2008 and believes that the adoption of FIN 48 will not have a material effect
on its consolidated financial statements.
In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157,
Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157. SFAS157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and
requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements under other
accounting pronouncements, but does not change the existing guidance as to
whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. The statement is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The Company
will adopt SFAS 157 in fiscal 2009 and is currently evaluating whether the
adoption of SFAS 157 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial
statements.
In February2007, the
FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities SFAS 159. SFAS 159
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain
other items at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure
requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose
different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The
statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007.
The Company will adopt SFAS 159 in fiscal 2009 and is currently evaluating
whether the adoption of SFAS 159 will have a material effect on its
consolidated financial statements.
2ACQUISITIONS
On April2, 2007, the Company acquired certain
assets of Organic Brands for cash consideration of approximately $55 million
and notes payable totaling $30 million. The cash portion of the purchase price
was financed by borrowings against the Companys line of credit. The operating
results of Organic Brands have been included in the consolidated financial
statements of the Company beginning with the acquisition date. The acquisition
resulted in goodwill of $18 million, all of which is expected to be deductible
for tax purposes. The goodwill recorded is subject to potential future
adjustments. Such goodwill was assigned to the Companys manufacturing division.
Other intangible assets acquired were $50 million.
During the year ended July28, 2007, the Company
acquired certain assets related to additional product lines outside of the
wholesale segment. The total cash consideration paid for these product lines
was approximately $38 million in addition to approximately $02 million of
holdbacks recorded in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. The
cash paid was financed by borrowings against the  44 Companys line of credit. The
consolidated financial statements of the Company have included operating
results of each of these product lines since the respective acquisition dates. Resulting
goodwill of $01 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes and is
subject to potential future adjustment. Other intangible assets acquired were
$34 million.
On July12, 2005, the Companys wholly owned
subsidiary, Alberts Organics,Inc., acquired substantially all of the
assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of Roots Fruits
Cooperative Produce Roots Fruits, a Minnesota-based organic
wholesale distributor of fresh produce and other perishables, for cash
consideration of approximately $103 million. The acquisition was financed by
borrowings against the Companys line of credit. The operating results of Roots
Fruits have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the
Company beginning with the acquisition date. The acquisition resulted in
goodwill of $113 million, all of which is expected to be deductible for tax
purposes. Such goodwill was assigned to the Companys wholesale segment.
On December20, 2004,
the Company acquired by merger privately held Select Nutrition Distributors,Inc.
Select Nutrition, a national distributor of health beauty aids
and vitamins, minerals supplements headquartered in New York, for
cash consideration and assumed debt of approximately $126 million. The
acquisition was financed by borrowings against the Companys line of credit. The
operating results of Select Nutrition have been included in the consolidated
financial statements of the Company beginning with the acquisition date. The
acquisition resulted in goodwill of $68 million, none of which is expected to
be deductible for tax purposes. Such goodwill was assigned to the Companys
wholesale segment.
3STOCK
OPTION PLANS 
Prior to August1, 2005, the Company accounted
for its stock options using the intrinsic value method of accounting provided
under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, and related
interpretations, as permitted by SFAS No123, Accounting
for Share-Based Compensation SFAS 123. The Company, applying the
intrinsic value method, did not record share-based compensation cost in net
earnings because the exercise price of its stock options equaled the market
price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Accordingly, share-based
compensation was included as a pro forma disclosure in the financial statement
footnotes and continues to be provided for periods prior to August1,
2005.
Effective August1, 2005, the Company adopted the
fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the
modified-prospective transition method. Under this transition method,
compensation cost recognized in fiscal 2006 includes: acompensation
cost for all share-based payments granted through August1, 2005, but for
which the requisite service period had not been completed as of August1,
2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
original provisions of SFAS 123, and bcompensation cost for all
share-based payments granted subsequent to August1, 2005, based on the
grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
123R. Results for prior periods have not been restated.
The Company recognized share-based compensation
expense of $40 million, or $006 per diluted share, for the year ended
July28, 2007. The Company recognized share-based compensation expense of
$55 million, or $008 per diluted share, for the year ended July29,
2006, of which $10 million related to the accelerated vesting of certain
options pursuant to the employment transition agreement the Company entered
into during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 with its former President and
Chief Executive Officer. In the year ended July31, 2005, the Company
recognized $02 million of share-based compensation expense, primarily related
to restricted stock awards. 45 As of July28, 2007, there was $87 million of
total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding share-based
compensation arrangements including stock option and nonvested share awards.
This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 15
years.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company
presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock
options as operating cash flows in the Condensed Consolidated Cash Flow
statement. SFAS 123Rrequires the cash flows resulting from tax
deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those stock
options excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows. 
The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share as
if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123

For stock options, the fair value of each grant was
estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Black-Scholes
utilizes assumptions related to volatility, the risk-free interest rate, the
dividend yield and expected life. Expected volatilities utilized in the model
are based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock price. The
risk-free interest rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect
at the time of grant. The model incorporates exercise and post-vesting
forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected
life of the fiscal 2007 grants is derived from historical information and other
factors.

As of July28, 2007, the Company had two stock
option plans: the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan and the 1996 Stock Option Plan
collectively, the Plans. The Plans provide for grants of stock options to  46 employees, officers,
directors and others. These options are intended to either qualify as incentive
stock options within the meaning of Section422 of the Internal Revenue
Code or be non-statutory stock options. Vesting requirements for awards under
the Plans are at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors and are
typically four years with graded vesting for employees and two years with
graded vesting for non-employee directors. The maximum term of all incentive
stock options granted under the Plans, and non-statutory stock options granted
under the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, is ten years. The maximum term for
non-statutory stock options granted under the 1996 Stock Option Plan is at the
discretion of the Companys Board of Directors, and all grants to date have had
a term of ten years. There were 7,800,000 shares authorized for grant under the
Plans. As of July28, 2007, 381,104 shares were available for grant under
the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan. The Company has a policy of issuing new shares
to satisfy stock option exercises.

4TREASURY
STOCK
On December1, 2004,
the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million
of common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions. As part of the stock repurchase program, the Company purchased
228,800 shares of its common stock for its treasury during the year ended July29,
2006 at an aggregate cost of approximately $61 million. All shares were
purchased at prevailing market prices. No such purchases were made during the
year ended July28, 2007.
5RESTRUCTURING
CHARGE
In the first quarter of
fiscal 2005, the Companys management approved and implemented plans to
restructure the broadline distribution operations at its Mounds View, Minnesota
distribution facility because the facility was not large enough to accommodate
the needs of customers relative to product selection and availability. The $02
million restructuring charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 was associated
primarily with severance costs related to the termination of approximately 85
employees at this facility. This restructuring was completed in the third
quarter of fiscal 2005. The accruals related to the restructuring were utilized
by the end of fiscal 2005.
6ASSETS
HELD FOR SALE
In November2005, the Company transitioned all
remaining operations at one of its two Auburn, California facilities to a new
facility in Rocklin, California. As a result, the Company reclassified $74
million of long-lived assets related to the Auburn facility that were
previously included in property and equipment as held for sale in the
consolidated balance sheet. In June2006, the Company sold a portion of
these long-lived assets for less than $01 million, resulting in a loss of $05
million, which was recorded in operating expenses in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2006. In January2007, the Company sold the remaining long-lived
assets for $54 million, resulting in a loss of $15 million, which was
recorded in operating expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2007.
In the nine months ended April28, 2007, the
Company transitioned its remaining Auburn, California operations to its
Rocklin, California facility, reached a decision to sell the second Auburn,
California facility and related assets and recorded an impairment loss of $08
million. The impairment loss was recognized based on managements estimate of
fair value of the facility, less costs of disposal. As a result, the Company
reclassified, to assets held for sale within the Wholesale segment, $59
million of long-lived assets, net of the $08 million impairment loss, that
were previously included in property and equipment in accordance with SFAS 144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-lived Assets. 48 7NOTES
PAYABLE
On April30, 2004, the Company entered into an
amended and restated four-year $250 million secured revolving credit facility
with a bank group that was led by Bank of America Business Capital formerly
Fleet Capital Corporation as the administrative agent the amended credit
facility. The amended credit facility increased the amount available for
borrowing from $150 million to $250 million, on which interest accrues, at the
Companys option, at the New York Prime Rate 825% at July28, 2007 and July29,
2006 or at the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus 125%. The $250
million credit facility matures on March31, 2008. The Company is
currently investigating options for renewing or renegotiating this credit
facility. The Company amended this facility effective in January2006,
reducing the rate at which interest accrues on LIBOR borrowing to LIBOR plus
075%. The weighted average interest rate on the amended credit facility was
607% as of July28, 2007. As of July28, 2007, the Companys
outstanding borrowings under the amended credit facility totaled $1200 million
with an availability of $1179 million. As more fully discussed in Note 9, the
Company entered into certain interest rate swap agreements to hedge this
indebtedness which were assigned and transferred to a third party in December2003.
The amended credit
facility contains certain restrictive covenants. The Company was in compliance
with all restrictive covenants at July28, 2007. The amended credit
facility also provides for the bank to syndicate the credit facility to other
banks and lending institutions. The Company has pledged the majority of its
accounts receivable and inventory for its obligations under the amended credit
facility.
8LONG-TERM
DEBT
The Company entered into a $30 million term loan
agreement with a financial institution effective April30, 2003. The term
loan was repayable over seven years based on a fifteen year amortization
schedule. Interest accrued at 30 day LIBOR plus 150%. The Company has pledged
certain real property as collateral for its obligations under the term loan
agreement. In July2005, the Company amended the term loan agreement with
the financial institution, increasing the principal amount available up to $75
million, decreasing the interest rate to 30 day LIBOR plus 10%, and extending
the maturity date to July2012. 49 As of July28,

9FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Companys interest
rate swap agreement at July28, 2007 is designated as a cash flow hedge
and is reflected at fair value in its consolidated balance sheet and the
related gains or losses on this contract are deferred in stockholders equity
as a component of other comprehensive income. However, to the extent that any
such contracts are not considered to be perfectly effective in offsetting the
change in the value of the items being hedged, any changes in fair value
relating to the ineffective portion of these contracts are immediately
recognized in income. At July28, 2007, the Company did not have any
ineffectiveness in its derivatives requiring current income recognition.
Interest Rate Swap
Agreements
Interest rate swap agreements are entered into for periods
consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions
independent of those exposures. At July28, 2007, the Company had one
outstanding interest rate swap agreement with a fair value of $06 million. The
agreement provides  50 for the Company to pay
interest for a seven-year period at a fixed rate of 470% on a notional
principal amount of $50 million while receiving interest for the same period at
LIBOR on the same notional principal amount. The swap has been entered into as
a hedge against LIBOR movements on current variable rate indebtedness totaling
$65 million at LIBOR plus 100%, thereby fixing its effective rate on the
notional amount at 570%. The swap agreement qualified as an effective hedge
under SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133. LIBOR was 532% and
540% as of July28, 2007 and July29, 2006, respectively.
In May2003, the
Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement. The agreement provided
for the Company to pay interest for a seven-year period at a fixed rate of
368% on a notional principal amount of $30 million while receiving interest
for the same period at LIBOR on the same notional principal amount. The swap
had been entered into as a hedge against LIBOR movements on current variable
rate indebtedness totaling $30 million at LIBOR plus 150%, thereby fixing the
effective rate on the notional amount at 518%. The swap agreement qualified as
an effective hedge under SFAS 133. On July29, 2005, this agreement was
terminated and income of $06 million was recorded in other expense income in
the Companys statement of income for the year ended July31, 2005.
Commodity Swap
Agreements
The Company has entered
into commodity swap agreements to reduce price risk associated with anticipated
purchases of diesel fuel. These swap agreements hedge a portion of the Companys
expected fuel usage for the periods set forth in the agreements. The agreements
call for an exchange of payments with the Company making payments based on
fixed price per gallon and receiving payments based on floating prices, without
an exchange of the underlying commodity amount upon which the payments are
based. The Company monitors the commodity NYMEX #2 Heating oil used in its
swap agreements to determine that the correlation between the commodity and
diesel fuel is deemed to be highly effective.
At July28, 2007, the Company had no outstanding commodity swap
agreements. During the year ended July28, 2007, the Company had two
commodity swaps which commenced and expired on November1, 2005 and October31,
2006, respectively and July1, 2006 and June30, 2007, respectively.
10COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company leases various facilities and equipment
under operating lease agreements with varying terms. Most of the leases contain
renewal options and purchase options at several specific dates throughout the
terms of the leases.
Rent and other lease expense for the years ended July28,
2007, July29, 2006, and July31, 2005 totaled approximately $232
million, $140 million, and $149 million, respectively.
Future minimum annual
fixed payments required under non-cancelable operating leases having an
original term of more than one year as of July28, 2007 are as follows

2007.
Assets mortgaged amounted to approximately $1008
million at July28, 2007.
The Company may from time
to time be involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary
course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of
these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys
consolidated financial position or results of operations.
11RETIREMENT
PLAN
The Company has one
defined contribution retirement plan, the United Natural Foods,Inc.
Retirement Plan the Plan. During fiscal 2006, the Company merged the
defined contribution plans of Select Nutrition and Roots Fruits into
the Plan. Under the Plan, employees may elect to contribute a percentage of
their pay to the Plan on a before-tax basis. In order to become a participant
in the Plan, employees must meet certain eligibility requirements as described
in the Plans document. In addition to amounts contributed to the Plan by
employees, the Company makes contributions to the Plan on behalf of the
employees. The Company contributions to the Plan were approximately $23
million, $21 million, and $20 million, for the years ended July28,
2007, July29, 2006, and July31, 2005, respectively.
12 EMPLOYEE STOCK
OWNERSHIP PLAN
The Company adopted the UNFI Employee Stock Ownership
Plan the ESOP Plan for the purpose of acquiring outstanding shares of the
Company for the benefit of eligible employees. The ESOP Plan was effective as
of November1, 1988 and has received notice of qualification by the
Internal Revenue Service.
In connection with the adoption of the ESOP Plan, a
Trust was established to hold the shares acquired. On November1, 1988,
the Trust purchased 40% of the then outstanding Common Stock of the Company at
a price of $41 million. The trustees funded this purchase by issuing
promissory notes to the initial stockholders, with the Trust shares pledged as
collateral. These notes bear interest at 10% and are payable through May2015.
As the debt is repaid, shares are released from collateral and allocated to
active employees, based on the proportion of debt service paid in the year.
The Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position
93-6, Employers Accounting for
Employee Stock Ownership Plans, SOP 93-6, in November1993. The statement
provides guidance on employers accounting for ESOPs and is required to be
applied to shares purchased by ESOPs after December31, 1992 that have not
been committed to be released as of the beginning of the year of adoption. As
allowed under SOP93-6, the Company elected not to adopt the
guidance in SOP 93-6 for the shares held by the ESOP, all of which were
purchased prior to December31, 1992. As a result, the Company continues
to follow the guidance of SOP76-3, Accounting
Practices for Certain Employee Stock Ownership Plans SOP 76-3.
Under SOP76-3, unreleased shares of the ESOP are considered to be
outstanding for purposes of calculating both basic and diluted earnings per
share, whether or not the shares have been committed to be released. The debt
of the ESOP is recorded as debt and the shares pledged as collateral are
reported as unearned ESOP shares in the consolidated balance sheets. During the
fiscal years ended July28, 2007, July29, 2006, and July31,
2005, contributions totaling approximately $03 million, $04 million, and $03
million, respectively, were made to the Trust. Of these contributions,
approximately $01million represented interest in fiscal 2007 and
approximately $02million represented interest in fiscal 2006 and 2005. 52 The
ESOP shares were classified as follows:

respectively.

At July28, 2007, the Company had net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $42 million for federal income tax
purposes. The federal carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation of $249
thousand under Internal Revenue Code Section382. The carryforwards expire
at various times between 2020 and 2024. In addition, the company had net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $182 million for state income
tax purposes that expire in years 2007 through 2025.
In assessing the recoverability of deferred tax
assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Due to the fact
that the Company has sufficient taxable income in the federal carryback period
and anticipates sufficient future taxable income over the periods which the
deferred tax assets are deductible, the ultimate realization of deferred tax
assets for federal and state tax purposes, with the exception of certain state
operating loss carryforwards, appears more likely than not at July28,
2007. 54 14 BUSINESS
SEGMENTS
The Company has several operating divisions aggregated
under the wholesale segment, which is the Companys only reportable segment.
These operating divisions have similar products and services, customer
channels, distribution methods and historical margins. The wholesale segment is
engaged in national distribution of natural foods, produce and related products
in the United States. The Company has additional operating divisions that do
not meet the quantitative thresholds for reportable segments. Therefore, these
operating divisions are aggregated under the caption of Other with corporate
operating expenses that are not allocated to operating divisions. Non-operating
expenses that are not allocated to the operating divisions are under the
caption of Unallocated Expenses. Other includes a retail division, which
engages in the sale of natural foods and related products to the general public
through retail storefronts on the east coast of the United States, a
manufacturing division, which engages in importing, roasting and packaging of
nuts, seeds, dried fruit and snack items, and our branded product lines. Other
also includes corporate expenses, which consist of salaries, retainers, and
other related expenses of officers, directors, corporate finance including
professional services, governance, human resources and internal audit that are
necessary to operate the Companys headquarters located in Dayville,
Connecticut. The Company does not record its revenues for financial reporting
purposes by product group, and it is therefore impracticable for the Company to
report them accordingly. 55 Following

a Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in Rules13a-15eand 15d-15eof
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act as of the
end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form10-K the Evaluation
Date. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure
controls and procedures are effective.
b Managements
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
control over financial reporting is defined in Rules13a-15for
15d-15f promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or
under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial
officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
includes those policies and procedures that Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and
Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of July28, 2007. In making
this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework.
Based on our assessment, our management concluded
that, as of July28, 2007, our internal control over financial reporting
was effective based on those criteria at the reasonable assurance level.
The effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of July 28, 2007 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is
included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 58 c Report
of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.
See report of KPMG LLP in Item 8 on pages 33 and 34.
d Changes
in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
No change in our internal
control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f
occurred during the fiscal quarter ended July28, 2007 that materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.
