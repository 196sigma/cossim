49 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of   VNUS Medical Technologies, Inc.   We have completed integrated audits of VNUS Medical
Technologies, Inc.s 2006 and 2005 consolidated financial
statements and of its internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2006 and an audit of its 2004
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.   Consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of VNUS Medical Technologies, Inc. and
its subsidiaries at December31, 2006 and 2005, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2006 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These financial statements
and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.   As discussed in Note13 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
for stock-based compensation in 2006.   Internal
control over financial reporting   Also, we have audited managements assessment, included in
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item9A, that VNUS Technologies,
Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2006, because the Company did
not maintain effective controls over the completeness and
accuracy of accrued liabilities and operating expenses, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The
Companys management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.   We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; iiprovide reasonable   
50 Table of Contents   assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The
following material weakness has been identified and included in
managements assessment as of December31, 2006.   The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
completeness and accuracy of accrued liabilities and operating
expenses. Specifically, the Company failed to maintain effective
controls over the cutoff of vendor invoices to ensure that all
liabilities were recorded in the appropriate accounting period.
This control deficiency resulted in an audit adjustment to the
Companys 2006 annual consolidated financial statements.
Additionally, this control deficiency could result in a
misstatement of accrued liabilities and related operating
expenses that would result in a material misstatement to the
Companys interim or annual consolidated financial
statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly,
management has determined that this control deficiency
constitutes a material weakness.   This material weakness was considered in determining the nature,
timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the
2006 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion
regarding the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on
those consolidated financial statements.   In our opinion, managements assessment that VNUS Medical
Technologies, Inc. did not maintain effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established
in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the COSO. Also, in our opinion, because of the
effects of the material weakness described above on the
achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, VNUS
Medical Technologies, Inc. has not maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006,
based on criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.   /s/PricewaterhouseCoopers

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   Note1
The Company   VNUS
Medical Technologies, Inc. the Company was
incorporated in Delaware on January4, 1995. The Company is
a leading provider of medical devices for the minimally invasive
treatment of venous reflux disease, a progressive condition
caused by incompetent vein valves in the legs. The Company also
provides devices for use in the minimally invasive treatment of
other peripheral vascular diseases, including devices for use in
peripheral arterial bypass and arteriovenous access procedures.
In late 1998, the Company introduced its
Closure
system in Europe. In late 1999, the Company introduced its
Closure system in the United States. In 2005, the Company
introduced the
ClosureRFStm
line of products for the minimally invasive treatment of
perforator and tributary vein reflux.   The Company has funded its operations through the issuance of
convertible preferred stock and common stock, and through cash
provided from operations. During 1999, the Company commenced
volume shipment of its product and emerged from the development
stage. Although no longer in the development stage, the Company
continues to be subject to certain risks common to companies in
similar stages of development, including its dependence on a
limited product line; limited manufacturing, marketing and sales
experience; reliance on key individuals; potential competition
from larger, more established companies and uncertainty of
future profitability. The Company completed its initial public
offering of common stock in October 2004.   Note2
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Principles of consolidation and basis of
presentation.The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.   Use of Estimates.The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.   Net Income Loss Per Share.The Company
computes basic net income loss per share by dividing net
income loss available to common stockholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period
less the weighted average number of common shares subject to
repurchase by the Company. Basic net income loss per share
excludes the dilutive effect of potential stock including stock
options, restricted stock units and warrants. Diluted income per
share reflects the dilution of potential common shares
outstanding during the period. In computing diluted income per
share, the Company adjusts share count by assuming that all
in-the-money
options and restricted stock units are exercised and that the
Company repurchases shares with the proceeds of these
hypothetical exercises. The Company further assumes that any
unamortized deferred stock-based compensation is also used to
repurchase shares. In determining the hypothetical shares
repurchased, the Company uses the average stock price for the
period.

2,032   214   38   Cash and Cash Equivalents.The Company
considers all highly-liquid investment instruments with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. As of December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the
Company held its cash and cash equivalents in a checking
account, a money market account and investment accounts with
several high-credit-quality financial institutions.   Short-Term Investments.Short-term
investments, which include money market instruments, debt
instruments of the U.S.government and its agencies and
high-quality corporate issuers, are classified as
available-for-sale
and reported at fair value using the specific identification
method. Unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings
and reported as a component of other comprehensive income
loss. Additionally, the Company assesses whether an
other-than-temporary
impairment loss on its investments has occurred due to declines
in fair value or other market conditions. The Company has not
identified any such impairment losses to date.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments.The
Companys financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments, prepaid expenses and other
current assets, accrued liabilities and accounts payable are
carried at cost, which approximates fair value because of the
short-term nature of those instruments.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Inventories.Inventories are stated at the
lower of cost or market, cost being determined using the
first-in,
first-out method. Lower of cost or market is evaluated by
considering obsolescence, excessive levels of inventory,
deterioration and other factors.   Property and Equipment.Property and equipment
are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, or the lease term of the respective assets, if
applicable. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the
straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful
life of the asset or the term of the lease.   The depreciation and amortization period for property and
equipment categories are as follows   	
Furniture and fixtures
3years
Computer and office equipment
3years
Laboratory equipment
5years
Purchased software
3 to 5years
Upon retirement or sale, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and the
resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations. Repairs and
maintenance are charged to operations as incurred.   Long-Lived Assets.The Company evaluates its
long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment by
comparison of the carrying amounts to future net undiscounted
cash flows expected to be generated by such assets when events
or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. Should an impairment exist, the
impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying
value of the asset over the assets fair value or
discounted estimates of future cash flows.   Revenue Recognition.The Company sells its
disposable catheters and radio frequency, or RF, generators, to
end-users in the United States and in international markets.
Catheters and RF generators are also sold through distributors
in international markets. The Company also sells RF generators
to third-party leasing companies in the United States. These
third-party leasing companies provide long-term lease financing
to end-users. The Company does not provide such long-term lease
financing to end-users.   The Company recognizes revenues from the sale of its products in
accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB
No104, Revenue Recognition, when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, title has transferred, the
sellers price is fixed or determinable and collectibility
is reasonably assured. For an arrangement with multiple
deliverables, the Company recognizes product sales in accordance
with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF
No00-21,
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables with
revenues allocated among the different elements, and in
accordance with EITF
No03-05,
Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position
97-2 to
Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing
More-Than-Incidental
Software.   Where software is more than incidental to the product or the
arrangement, the Company recognizes revenues for those products
in accordance with
SOPNo97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by
SOPNo98-9,
Software Revenue Recognition with Respect to Certain
Agreements. The Company recognizes revenues when all of the
following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, delivery
has occurred, collection of the related receivable is probable.
Where software is incidental to the product or arrangement, the
Company recognizes revenues from the sale of those products in
accordance with SABNo104.   Revenues earned on software arrangements involving multiple
elements are allocated to each element based on vendor-specific
objective evidence of the fair value VSOE, which
is based on the price charged when the same element is sold
separately. In instances when evidence of VSOE of all
undelivered elements exists, but evidence does not exist for one
or more delivered elements, revenues are recognized using the
residual method. Under the residual method, the fair value of
the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion
of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue. In instances
when evidence of VSOE of all undelivered elements does not

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   exist, revenues are deferred on the entire arrangement until all
of the undelivered elements have been delivered, or evidence of
VSOE of the undelivered element exists.   The Companys domestic sales return policy allows customers
to return unused products for a period within 30days
subject to restocking fees. The Companys international
sales return policy allows customers to return unused products
for a period within 60days subject to restocking fees. The
Company makes provisions for estimated returns and allowances
based on historical levels. To date, returns and allowances have
not been significant.   Warranty.The Company provides a one year
limited warranty on its RF generator which is included in the
sales price of the generator. The Company provides for the
estimated future costs of repair, upgrade or replacement upon
shipment of the product. The warranty accrual is based upon
historical trends in the volume of product returns within the
warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment.
In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals are
made for specific technical problems.   Research and Development Costs.Costs related
to research, design and development of products are charged to
research and development expense as incurred.   Advertising Expenses.Advertising costs are
expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses incurred in the years
ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $262,000,
$321,000 and $229,000 respectively.   Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting
Principle.Upon the adoption of SFAS123R on
January1, 2006, the Company elected to adopt the modified
prospective transition method of SFASNo123R,
Share-Based Payment, except for those options that
were measured using the minimum value method under
SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, for which the Company applied the
prospective transition method. The impact of the adoption has
resulted in an adjustment for the cumulative effect of a change
in accounting principle.   Accordingly, during the year ended December31, 2006, the
Company recorded stock-based compensation cost totaling the
amount that would have been recognized had the fair value method
been applied since the effective date of SFASNo123.
Previously reported amounts have not been restated. The
cumulative effect, through December31, 2005, was a
decrease in stock-based compensation expense and a corresponding
increase to equity of $73,000 to reflect the application of the
estimated forfeiture rates to deferred stock-based compensation
related to the intrinsic value of restricted stock units granted
in 2005.   Comprehensive Income Loss.Comprehensive
income loss is defined as the change in equity of a company
during a period from transactions and other events and
circumstances, excluding transactions resulting from investments
by owners and distributions to owners, and is to include
unrealized gains and losses that have historically been excluded
from net income and loss and reflected instead in equity.
Unrealized gains and losses on short-term investments are
recorded in other comprehensive income loss as a component of
equity.   Income Taxes.The Company accounts for income
taxes under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset or
liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet
date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in
which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements.In June
2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached
a consensus on EITF Issue
No06-03,
How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income
Statement That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation
EITF
06-03.
EITF 06-03
provides that the presentation of taxes assessed by a
governmental authority that is directly imposed on a
revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer on
either a gross basis included in revenues and costs or on a
net basis excluded from revenues is an accounting policy
decision that should be disclosed. EITF

effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December15, 2006. The Company plans to adopt

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   EITF 06-03
in the first quarter of 2007. The adoption of EITF
06-03 is not
anticipated to have a material effect on our consolidated
financial statements.   In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an
interpretation of FASB Statement No109
FIN48 which prescribes a recognition
threshold and measurement attribute, as well as criteria for
subsequently recognizing, derecognizing and measuring uncertain
tax positions for financial statement purposes. FIN48 also
requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in
income tax assets and liabilities. FIN48 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006 and is
required to be recognized as a change in accounting principle
through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as
of the beginning of the year of adoption. The Company plans to
adopt FIN48 in the first quarter of 2007 and is currently
evaluating the impact on its financial statements.   On September13, 2006, the Securities and Exchange
Commission the SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No108 SAB108,
Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
Qualifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements, which provides interpretive guidance on the
consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in
quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a
materiality assessment. SAB108 is effective for companies
with fiscal years ending after November15, 2006 and is
required to be adopted by the Company in its current fiscal
year. The adoption of SAB108 did not have a material
effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo157,
Fair Value Measurements. SFASNo157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or
permit fair value measurements, the FASB having previously
concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is
the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, this Statement
does not require any new fair value measurements.
SFASNo157 is effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007,
and interim periods within those fiscal years. This Statement is
required to be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of
its fiscal year 2008. The Company is currently assessing the
impact of the adoption of SFAS No157 on our consolidated
financial statements.   In February 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo159,
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities which permits entities to choose to measure
many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value
that are not currently required to be measured at fair value.
SFAS159 will be effective for us on January1, 2008.
We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS159
on our consolidated financial statements.   Note3
Corporate Headquarters Relocation   On November15, 2005, VNUS entered into a lease agreement
with Legacy Partners I SJ Fontanoso, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company, for a 93,650square feet facility
located in SanJose, California. In June 2006, the Company
had completed the move of its corporate headquarters and
manufacturing operations to this facility.   Costs of $847,000 associated with exiting the remaining portion
of the old facility, including an impairment charge of $179,000
for the value of leasehold improvements and furniture and
fixtures which were abandoned at the old facility, were recorded
in general and administrative expenses during the year ended
December31, 2006. See Note16 Subsequent

determined based on the remaining lease payments due under the
contract, less the portion that would still be used by the
Company for storage for the remainder of the lease period. The
Company did not offset these lease payments by estimated
sublease rental income. Although management has retained the
services of a commercial real estate broker to market the
facility to prospective subtenants, management concluded that
subleasing the old facility was improbable, based upon the short
remaining term of the lease 6months and the
configuration of the remaining leased space.   Note4
Concentration of Credit Risk   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a
concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable.
Cash and cash equivalents are deposited in demand and money
market accounts in several financial institutions in the United
States and internationally. Deposits held with financial
institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such
deposits. The Company has not experienced any material losses on
its deposits of cash and cash equivalents.   Concentrations of credit risk with respect to short-term
investments are limited due to the Companys cash
investment policies which limit cash investments to short-term,
low-risk investments. Short-term investments include money
market instruments, debt instruments of the U.S.government
and its agencies and high-quality corporate issuers, all with
maturity dates less than one year.   Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts
receivable are limited due to the large number of customers
comprising the Companys customer base and their dispersion
across many geographies. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers and generally does not require
collateral from its customers. The Company maintains an
allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected
collectibility of all accounts receivable. No single customer
represents more than 10% of the accounts receivable amount or
revenues for any period presented.   The Company relies on Byers Peak, Inc. to manufacture its RF
generators. The initial term of the supply agreement with Byers
peak expired in February 2007, however, the contract continues
indefinitely until terminated by either party upon
180days notice. The Company expects that Byers Peak,
Inc. will be a sole-source supplier of the RF generators for the
foreseeable future. The Company also relies on sole-source
suppliers to manufacture some of the components used in its
disposable catheters. The Companys manufacturers and
suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing due to a
variety of reasons, including failure to follow specific
protocols and procedures, failure to comply with applicable
regulations, including the Food and Drug Administrations
Quality System Regulations, equipment malfunction and
environmental factors, any of which could delay or impede its
ability to meet demand.

Due to uncertainties surrounding the realization of deferred tax
assets through future taxable income, the Company has provided a
full valuation allowance, and, therefore, no benefit has been
recognized for the NOL and other deferred tax assets.
Approximately $279,000 of these deferred tax assets pertain to
certain net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the
exercise of employee stock options. When recognized, the tax
benefit of these loss carryforwards are accounted for as a
credit to additional paid-in capital rather than a reduction of
the income tax provision.   The Tax Reform Act of 1986 limits the use of NOL and tax credit
carryforwards in the case of an ownership change of
a corporation. Any ownership changes, as defined, may restrict
utilization of carryforwards.   Note12

unenforceable. On December9, 2005, AngioDynamics and
Vascular Solutions both answered the Companys amended
complaint and asserted counterclaims against the Company for a
judicial declaration that the asserted patents are not infringed

counterclaims against it. On October30, 2006 a claims
construction hearing was held, and on November20, 2006,
the Court issued its Order Construing Claims. The Court has
scheduled the trial in this matter to begin in October 2007.   The Company is also involved in other legal proceedings arising
in the ordinary course of its business. While there can be no
assurances as to the ultimate outcome of any litigation
involving the Company, management does not believe any pending
legal proceeding will result in a judgment or settlement that
would have a material adverse effect on the Companys
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash

Note16 Subsequent Event   Indemnifications.In the normal course of
business, the Company enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations and warranties and provide for
general indemnifications. The Companys exposure under
these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may
be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been
made. To date, the Company has not paid any claims or been
required to defend any action related to its indemnification
obligations, and accordingly, the Company has not accrued any
amounts for such indemnification obligations. However, the
Company may record charges in the future as a result of these
indemnification obligations.   Purchase Commitments.At December31,
2006, the Company had approximately $42million in
purchase commitments for the next twelve months with suppliers,
of which $24million was inventory related.   Note13
Stock Based Compensation   Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted the
provisions of SFASNo123R, Share-Based
Payment.SFASNo123R
establishes accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for
employee services. Accordingly, stock-based compensation cost is
measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award,
and is recognized as expense over the employees requisite
service period. The Company has no awards with market
conditions. The Company previously applied Accounting Principles
Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations and
provided the required pro-forma disclosures of
SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.   The Company awards a limited number of stock options and
warrants to non-employees. Non-cash stock-based expense from
options and warrants issued to non-employees is accounted for in
accordance with the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force
Pronouncement
No96-18,
Accounting for Equity Investments that are Issued to
Non-Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling,
Goods or Services. For these options and warrants, the
non-cash stock-based expense is recognized over the service
period of the underlying awards, based on an estimate of their
fair value on the vesting dates using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. All unvested options issued to
non-employees are marked to market until such options vest. In
2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded non-employee stock
compensation expense of $10,000, $62,000 and $181,000,
respectively.

Additionally, the stock-based employee compensation determined

using the minimum value method.   The weighted average per share fair value of options granted in
the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004 were $639 and
$247, respectively.   Impact
of the adoption of SFASNo123R   The Company elected to adopt the modified prospective
application method as provided by SFASNo123R,
except for those options that were measured using the minimum
value method under SFASNo123, for which the Company
has adopted the prospective transition method. Under the
modified prospective application, prior periods are not revised
for comparative purposes. The valuation provisions of
SFAS123R apply to new awards and to awards that are
outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified or
cancelled. Estimated compensation expense, net of estimated
forfeitures, for awards outstanding at the effective date will
be recognized over the remaining service period.   On November10, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued FASB Staff Position
No.SFASNo123R-3, Transition
Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based
Payment Awards. The Company has elected to adopt the
alternative transition method provided in this FASB Staff
Position for calculating the tax effects of share-based
compensation pursuant to SFASNo123R. The
alternative transition method includes a simplified method to
establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in
capital pool APIC pool related to the tax effects of employee
share-based compensation, which is available to absorb tax
deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of
SFASNo123R. There was no tax benefit realized

Assumptions   The Companys determination of fair value of share-based
payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing
model is affected by the Companys stock price as well as
assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective
variables.   The weighted average estimated fair value of options granted
during the twelve month periods ended December31, 2006,
December31, 2005 and December31, 2004, were
calculated under the Black-Scholes model, using the following
weighted-average assumptions

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model, consistent with
the provisions of SFASNo123R, SABNo107
and the Companys prior period pro forma disclosures of net
earnings, including stock-based compensation. The Black-Scholes
option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of short-lived exchange traded options that have no
vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including the options expected life and the
price volatility of the underlying stock. In connection with the
adoption of SFASNo123R, the Company reassessed
its valuation technique and related assumptions.   Expected volatility used in fiscal 2006 was determined using the
historical volatility of the Companys common stock and the
historical volatility of a number of peer companies to
approximate expected volatility over the expected term of the
options. Prior to the adoption of SFASNo123R, the
Company used the historical volatility of its common stock after
its initial public offering in October 2004 in deriving the
expected volatility assumption.   
69 Table of Contents   VNUS
MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   The expected term of employee options granted was determined in
the first three quarters of 2006 based on
SABNo107s simplified method for estimating
expected term and represents the period of time that options
granted are expected to be outstanding. For the fourth quarter
of 2006, the Company determined the expected term of employee
options granted based upon a blended average of the
Companys historical experience and historical experience
of a number of peer companies. Prior to the adoption of
SFASNo123R, the Company was estimating the
expected term based on its historical exercise and post-vesting
cancellation experience. The risk-free interest rate for periods
within the contractual life of the option is based on the
monthly average risk-free zero-coupon interest rate that
corresponds to the expected term.   The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends and
does not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.   The Company has used forfeiture rates in its calculation of
stock-based compensation expense for the twelve months ending
December31, 2006 of 1%, 83% and 276%, depending on the
stratification of the optionees, based onhistorical
experience over the term. Stock-based compensation expense
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the
twelve month period ending December31, 2006 is based on
awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for
estimated forfeitures. SFASNo123R requires
forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if
necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
from those estimates. If pre-vesting forfeitures occur in the
future, the Company will true up expense related to such
forfeitures as the forfeitures occur. In the Companys pro
forma information required under SFASNo123 for the
periods prior to fiscal 2006, the Company accounted for
forfeitures as they occurred.   The fair value of each restricted stock unit award is estimated
on the date of grant based on the closing price of the
Companys stock. Stock based compensation expense related
to RSUs is recognized over the requisite service period,
adjusted for forfeiture rates of 1%, 83% and 276%, depending
on the stratification of the optionees.   Equity
Incentive Program   In 1995, the Company established the 1995 Stock Option Plan the
1995 Plan covering employees, directors and
consultants of the Company. Under the terms of the 1995 Plan,
incentive and nonqualified stock options and stock purchase
rights could be granted for up to 1,008,000shares of the
Companys authorized but unissued common stock. In May
2000, upon the adoption of the Companys 2000 Equity
Incentive Plan the 2000 Plan, the Company ceased
granting options under the 1995 Plan.   In May 2000, the Company established the 2000 Plan covering
employees, directors and consultants of the Company. Under the
terms of the 2000 Plan, as amended, incentive and nonqualified
stock options and stock purchase rights may be granted.
Initially, 420,000shares of the Companys authorized
but unissued common stock were available for grant under the
2000 Plan. On each anniversary of the 2000 Plans adoption
by the Board of Directors, the share reserve was automatically
increased by 98,000shares. In 2001 and 2002, the
stockholders approved a 300,000 and a 133,333share
increase to the 2000 Plan, respectively. In January 2004, the
stockholders approved a 333,333share increase to the 2000
Plan. In October 2004, the stockholders approved ian
800,000share increase to the 2000 Plan, which increased
the number of authorized shares of the Companys common
stock issuable under the 2000 Plan to 2,378,666, and
iion December31 of each year, beginning on
December31, 2005, further increase the number of shares
reserved for issuance under 2000 Plan by the lower of
x800,000shares, y4% of the number of
shares of the Companys common stock then outstanding or
zsuch other number of shares of our common stock as is
determined by the administrator of the 2000 Plan, provided that
the maximum number of shares of the Companys common stock
that may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock options
during the term of the 2000 Plan may not exceed 6,378,666.   Accordingly, on December31, 2006, 605,223shares were
authorized for issuance, equal to 4% of the shares outstanding
on that date. In September 2005, the Board of Directors adopted
a form of Restricted Stock Unit Award Grant Notice and
Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, intended to serve as a
standard form agreement for

Incentive Plan. The Board approved the Amended Equity
Incentive Plan in November 2005, which authorized the granting
of restricted stock units under the plan including the form of
grant adopted in September 2005 and permits employees to
surrender a portion of their RSU shares to pay for taxes.   Under the terms of the 1995 Plan and the Amended Equity
Incentive Plan, options and RSUs have a maximum term of
10years and vest over schedules determined by the Board of
Directors. Certain options, upon the discretion of the plan
administrator, are exercisable prior to becoming vested, and are
subject to the Companys right to repurchase the unvested
shares at the exercise price. Nonqualified stock options may be
granted to employees and consultants at no less than 85% of the
fair market value of the stock at the date of the grant.   In 2001, the Board of Directors approved a severance plan for
management and key employees whereby a change in control in the
Company would accelerate vesting of options under certain
conditions. On November7, 2005, the Board of Directors
adopted the Amended and Restated VNUS Severance Plan for
Management and Key Employees the Amended Severance
Plan. In particular, the Amended Severance Plan expands
the definition of good reason for determining
whether a participants termination of employment was a
qualifying termination, thereby entitling the
participant to certain payments and the acceleration of the
vesting of certain equity awards, including stock options,
restricted stock and restricted stock units. Good
reason now includes, with respect to participants that are
employees of the Company at the vice president level and above,
removal of duties customarily assigned to an employee with such
participants title, or a substantial adverse alteration in
the nature or status of such participants duties;
provided, however, that a significant reduction in job
responsibility
and/or
authority shall not be deemed to have occurred simply by virtue
of a change of control, the fact that the Company becomes a
subsidiaries of another entity or the Companys status
changing from publicly-traded to privately-held, as a result of
the change of control.

Controls
and Procedures   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as
such term is defined under Securities Exchange Act
Rules13a-15e
and
15d-15e,
that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures. We have carried out an evaluation under
the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective as of December31, 2006 due to the material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as
discussed in Managements Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting below.   MANAGEMENTS
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule13a-15f
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The Companys internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and timely reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2006. In making this assessment, our
management used the criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO.   A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected.   Managements assessment identified the following material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2006. The Company did not maintain effective
controls over the completeness and accuracy of accrued
liabilities and operating expenses. Specifically, the Company
failed to maintain effective controls over the cutoff of vendor
invoices to ensure that all liabilities were recorded in the
appropriate accounting period. This control deficiency resulted
in an audit adjustment to the Companys 2006 annual
consolidated financial statements. Additionally, this control
deficiency could result in a misstatement of accrued liabilities
and related operating expenses that would result in a material
misstatement of the Companys annual or interim
consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or
detected.   
76 Table of Contents   Because of the material weakness above, we have concluded that
the Company did not maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2006.   Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting has
been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
appearing in Item8 of this Annual Report on
Form10-K.   MANAGEMENTS
PLANS FOR REMEDIATION   In response to the material weakness in our internal control
over financial reporting discussed above, we plan to continue to
review and make necessary changes to improve the operating
effectiveness of our controls designed to ensure the
completeness and accuracy of accrued liabilities and related
operating expenses, including the timely accrual of operating
expenses for which vendor invoices are not received until
subsequent to our period-end financial reporting dates. The
Companys planned remediation measures include the
implementation of a process of enhanced review of open purchase
orders and review of invoices and receipts after the end of each
quarter to ensure proper recording of accrued expenses and open
purchase order commitments. In March 2007, the Company began
implementing additional training for the financial staff and
plans to continue this process to ensure that personnel have the
necessary competency, training and supervision for their
assigned level of responsibility and the nature and complexity
of the Companys business. We plan to further enhance the
discipline throughout the organization to achieve greater
compliance with policies, procedures and controls that are in
place, and also those that are being implemented, particularly
with respect to ensuring the completeness and accuracy of
accrued liabilities and related operating expenses.   CHANGES
IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   The Companys management identified a material weakness in
our internal control over financial reporting as discussed in
Managements Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting above. In addition, during the fourth
quarter of 2006, the Company hired a Corporate Controller.
