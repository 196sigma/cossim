Information regarding Selected Quarterly Financial Information is set forth
under Item 5 Market for Registrant Common Equity and Related Stockholder
Matters.
Report of Independent Accountants
to the Shareholders and Board of Directors,
Pharmacia & Upjohn, Inc. In our opinion, the consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated
statements of earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash flows present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Pharmacia & Upjohn, Inc. and
its subsidiaries at December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. These financial statements are the responsibility of
Pharmacia & Upjohn, Inc. management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards in the United States, which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Florham Park, New Jersey

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER-SHARE DATA.
1 POLICIES AND OTHER
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting
principles that are generally accepted in the United States U.S. All
professional accounting standards that are effective as of December 31, 1999
have been taken into consideration in preparing the financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported earnings, financial position and various
disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
-33-
37
On August 31, 1999, Pharmacia & Upjohn, Inc. P or the company completed a
merger with SUGEN, Inc. Sugen. The merger was accounted for as a pooling of
interests. Accordingly, all prior-period consolidated financial statements
presented have been restated to include the combined results of operations,
financial position, and cash flows of both companies as if Sugen had always been
a part of P
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and
all majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliates which
are not majority owned are reported using the equity method and are recorded in
other noncurrent assets. Gains and losses resulting from the issuance of
subsidiaries' stock are recognized in consolidated earnings.
CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The results of operations for non-U.S. subsidiaries, other than those located in
highly inflationary countries, are translated into U.S. dollars using the
average exchange rates during the year, while assets and liabilities are
translated using period-end rates. Resulting translation adjustments are
recorded as currency translation adjustments in shareholders' equity. For
subsidiaries in highly inflationary countries, currency gains and losses
resulting from translation and transactions are determined using a combination
of current and historical rates and are reported directly in the consolidated
statements of earnings.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenues are recognized when title to products is transferred and goods are
shipped to customers. Where right of return exists, revenues are reduced at the
time of sale to reflect expected returns that are estimated based on historical
experience.
CASH EQUIVALENTS
The company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with an original
maturity of 91 days or less to be cash equivalents.
INVESTMENTS
The company has investments in debt securities that are classified in the
consolidated balance sheet as short-term restricted bank deposits and
securities that mature in more than 91 days but not more than one year and
securities with maturities beyond one year which management intends to sell
within one year or long-term maturities beyond one year. The company also has
investments in equity securities, all of which are classified as long-term
investments.
Investments are further categorized as being available-for-sale or expected to
be held-to-maturity. Investments categorized as available-for-sale are marked to
market based on quoted market values of the securities, with the resulting
adjustments, net of deferred taxes, reported as a component of other
comprehensive income in shareholder equity until realized see Note 2.
Investments categorized as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost,
without recognition of gains or losses that are deemed to be temporary, because
the company has both the intent and the ability to hold these investments until
they mature.
INVENTORIES
-34-
38
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the
last-in, first-out LIFO method for substantially all U.S. inventories and the
first-in, first-out FIFO method for substantially all non-U.S. inventories.
PROPERTIES
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at acquisition cost. Depreciation is
computed principally on the straight-line method for financial reporting
purposes, while accelerated methods are used for income tax purposes where
permitted. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to earnings as incurred
including repair costs associated with the year 2000 date recognition problem.
Costs of renewals and improvements are capitalized. Upon retirement or other
disposition of property, any gain or loss is included in earnings.
Purchased computer software is capitalized and amortized over the software
useful life. Effective in 1998, internally-developed software is also
capitalized and amortized over its useful life with the adoption of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants' AICPA Statement of Position SOP
98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use. Prior to adoption, the company expensed these costs as incurred.
The effect of initially applying the provisions of SOP 98-1 was not material to
the consolidated financial statements.
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase cost over the fair value of net
assets acquired in a business or product acquisition and is presented net of
accumulated amortization. Amortization of goodwill is recorded on a
straight-line basis over periods ranging primarily from 5 to 20 years. The
company assesses the recoverability of goodwill when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. If an
impairment indicator exists, an estimate of future cash flows is developed and
compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill. If the expected undiscounted
cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the goodwill, an impairment loss
is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the goodwill and
discounted cash flows.
Rights acquired under patent are reported at acquisition cost. Amortization is
calculated on a straight-line basis over the remaining legal lives of the
patents. Other intangible assets are amortized over the useful lives of those
assets.
PRODUCT LIABILITY
The company is self-insured for product liability exposures up to reasonable
risk retention levels where excess coverages have been obtained. Liability
calculations take into account such factors as specific claim amounts, past
experience with such claims, number of claims reported and estimates of claims
incurred but not yet reported. In addition to this base level of reserves,
individually significant contingent losses are accrued for in compliance with
applicable guidance. Product liability accruals are not reduced for expected
insurance recoveries.
INCOME TAXES
The company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income
taxes. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement
and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for
the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The company records
deferred income taxes on subsidiaries' earnings that are not considered to be
permanently invested in those subsidiaries.

CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS
Forward currency exchange contracts, cross-currency interest-rate swaps, and
currency options hereafter referred to as contracts are held for purposes
other than trading. Contracts held to hedge anticipated transactions are marked
to market at each balance sheet date with resulting gains and losses recognized
in earnings. Contracts that hedge recorded assets and liabilities are valued at
the month-end exchange rate with resulting exchange gains and losses recognized
in earnings, offsetting the respective losses and gains recognized on the
underlying recorded exposure. Any premium or discount is amortized over the life
of the contract. The carrying values of all contracts are generally reported
with other current assets or other current liabilities. Gains or losses from
currency transactions that are designated as hedges of currency net investments
are classified as currency translation adjustments in shareholders' equity.
In 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities. This statement requires companies to record derivatives on
the balance sheet as assets and liabilities measured at fair value. The
accounting treatment of gains and losses resulting from changes in the value of
derivatives depends on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for
hedge accounting. The company will adopt SFAS No. 133 as required, no later than
January 1, 2001, and is currently assessing the impact of adoption on its
consolidated financial statements.
ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION LIABILITIES
The company accrues for environmental remediation liabilities when they are
probable and reasonably estimable based on current law and existing
technologies. The estimated liability is reduced to reflect the anticipated
participation of other potentially responsible parties where such parties are
considered solvent and it is probable that they will pay their respective share
of relevant costs. The accruals are adjusted as further information develops or
circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures do not reflect any claims for
recoveries and are not discounted to their present value. Accruals for
environmental liabilities are classified in the consolidated balance sheets
primarily as other noncurrent liabilities.
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
Employee stock options are accounted for pursuant to Accounting Principles Board
Opinion APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees see Note 19
for SFAS No. 123 disclosures.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications have been made to conform prior periods' data to the
current presentation.
MONSANTO MERGER AGREEMENT
On December 19, 1999, the company and Monsanto Company Monsanto announced they
had entered into a definitive agreement to merge. The merger, subject to the
approval of both companies' shareholders, is intended to be a tax-free
reorganization accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. The expected completion
of the merger in early 2000 will result in a restatement of financial statements
to reflect the combined entities under pooling-of-interests accounting.
2 OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
-36-
40
Effective January 1, 1998, the company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income. The statement establishes standards for reporting
comprehensive income and its components. Comprehensive income is defined as all
nonowner changes in equity and is equal to net earnings plus other comprehensive
income OCI. OCI for the company includes three components: changes in currency
translation adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale
securities, and minimum pension liability adjustments. The following table shows
the changes in each OCI component. Reclassification adjustments represent items
that are included in net earnings in the current period but previously were
reported in OCI. To avoid double counting these items in comprehensive income,
gains are subtracted from OCI, while losses are added.                                TAX

3 RESTRUCTURING
During 1999, the company recorded $70 in merger and restructuring expenses which
is comprised of $73 of merger and restructuring charges net of a $3 adjustment
to the 1998 turnaround restructuring. The charge consisted of $16 in merger
transaction costs such as fees for investment bankers, attorneys, accountants,
and other costs to effect the merger with Sugen, all of which were paid during
1999. The charge also included costs pertaining to reorganizations that will
result in the elimination of certain research and development R projects as
well as the elimination of 375 employee positions, mainly impacting the
prescription pharmaceutical segment and corporate and administrative functions.
The objective of the restructuring is to eliminate duplicate functions and
investments in R as well as reorganize the sales force based on anticipated
future requirements of the company. The adjustment to the prior restructuring
liabilities was attributable to lower than anticipated employee separation
costs.
Employee separation benefits included in the 1999 charge are for elimination of
positions in research and development of $26, corporate and administration of
$18 and sales of $6. Project termination costs totaled $4 and asset write-downs
totaled $3. During 1999, $3 was paid and charged against the liability. These
amounts related to a portion of separation benefits for the approximately 50
employees severed prior to the end of the year. The company anticipates all
activities associated with this restructuring to be substantially complete at
the end of 2000. The remaining cash expenditures are expected during 2000 with
some separation annuity payments being completed in 2001.
In 1997, the company announced a comprehensive turnaround program that resulted
in restructuring charges during 1997 and 1998. The company structured the
turnaround program in two phases reflecting management development and approval
of plans. The turnaround program was initiated in the third quarter 1997 and was
materially complete by December 31, 1999. The objectives of the turnaround
program were to significantly rationalize infrastructure, establish a global
headquarters in New Jersey, and eliminate duplicate resources in manufacturing,
administration, and R The turnaround program mainly affected the company
core pharmaceutical segments and corporate administration groups, with minor
restructuring of businesses included in the all other grouping. In the third
and fourth quarters of 1997, the company recorded phase one charges totaling
$316. The                    -38-
42
second phase of the turnaround program was finalized in the fourth quarter of
1998, resulting in an additional restructuring charge of $92.
The charge of $92 recorded in 1998 was comprised of employee separation costs of
$68; write-downs of fixed assets and abandoned manufacturing projects of $8; and
other costs of $16.
The 1997 restructuring charge of $316, for the first phase of the turnaround
program, primarily related to employee separation costs of $134; write-downs of
fixed assets and abandoned manufacturing projects of $162; and other costs of
$20.
The total restructuring charges for 1998 and 1997 included involuntary employee
separation costs for 580 and 1,320 employees worldwide, respectively. The 1998
charge included elimination of positions in marketing and administration of $55,
R of $9, and manufacturing of $4. These amounts included an adjustment of $16
of the phase one accruals, mainly attributable to lower employee separation
costs and, to a lesser extent, changes in plan estimates. The 1997 charge
included elimination of positions in marketing and administration of $81, R of
$22, and manufacturing of $31. As of December 31, 1999, the company had paid
$155 in severance costs in connection with the 1998 and 1997 charges. The
remaining balance for employee separation costs related to the turnaround
program was $44 at December 31, 1999 comprised mainly of charges related to the
phase two charge and remaining annuity separation payments. The company expects
some annuity payments to continue into 2001.
The 1998 and 1997 restructuring charges included asset write-downs for excess
manufacturing, administration, and R facilities totaling $8 and $162,
respectively. The 1998 amount included an adjustment of $15 of the phase one
accruals, mainly attributable to changes in plan estimates, favorable outcomes
on sales of facilities, and actual facility closure costs below the original
estimates. At December 31, 1999, facilities presently being marketed had a net
book value of $47. Fixed asset write-downs were based on appraisals less costs
to sell.
Other costs included in the 1998 and 1997 restructuring charges of $16 and $20,
respectively, were primarily comprised of canceled contractual lease obligations
and other costs. Offsetting 1998 charges in this grouping was an adjustment of
$6 related to all restructuring charges prior to 1997.

Net deferred tax assets         $  606           $  499
Valuation allowances have been provided for certain deferred tax assets that are
not likely to be realized. The changes in the valuation allowances were
increases of $5, $34 and $13 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively. The increases in the allowance during 1997 and 1998 were
primarily due to certain tax credit carryforwards that were not likely to be
realized as a result of the Sugen merger. The increase in the valuation
allowance during 1999 was primarily attributable to certain tax credit
carryforwards that were not likely to be realized.
Tax loss carryforwards of $203 have various expiration dates through 2018. At
December 31, 1999, undistributed earnings of subsidiaries considered permanently
invested, for which deferred income taxes have not been provided, were
approximately $3,500. 5 SUGEN MERGER
On August 31, 1999, the company completed its merger with Sugen by exchanging
approximately 10 million shares of its common stock for all of the common stock
of Sugen. Each share of Sugen common stock was exchanged for 6091 of one share
of Pharmacia & Upjohn common stock. In addition, terms on outstanding Sugen
stock options, stock warrants, convertible debt, and warrants on convertible
debt were changed to convert Sugen shares to P shares using the same exchange
ratio.
The merger, a tax-free reorganization, was accounted for as a pooling of
interests under APB Opinion No. 16. As a result, all prior period consolidated
financial statements presented have been restated to include the combined
results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of both companies as
if Sugen had always been a part of P There were no transactions between P
and Sugen prior to the combination. Immaterial reclassifications were recorded
to conform Sugen financial statements to P presentation.
The results of operations for the separate companies and the combined amounts
presented in the consolidated financial statements for the period prior to the
merger follow. The adjustment represents the tax benefit of Sugen net
operating loss that had been fully reserved for by Sugen.                SIX MONTHS ENDED

6 BIOTECH AND NUTRITION DIVESTITURES
In December 1998, the company sold substantially all of its nutrition business
to Fresenius AG for a loss of $52. To comply with antitrust regulations in
Germany, operations there were not sold to Fresenuis. In the third quarter of
1999, the company completed the sale of the nutrition business in Germany to
Baxter Deutschland GmbH for a gain. As of December 31, 1999, the closing of the
sale of the operations in China was still pending regulatory approval.
In August 1997, the company merged its biotechnology supply business, Pharmacia
Biotech, with Amersham Life Science, a division of Amersham International plc,
in a noncash transaction that did not result in the recognition of a gain or
loss. The merger created a new company, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Ltd., of
which Pharmacia & Upjohn owns 45 percent which is accounted for using the equity
method. In 1999 and 1998, P recorded credits of $38 and $52 respectively,
primarily representing the company share of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech
pretax earnings. In 1997, the company recorded $79 in charges related to the
Biotech merger and subsequent restructuring of the new company. Of this total 36 consisted of transaction costs to effect the merger and a write-off of
certain acquired research and development costs. The earnings statement effects
of these events and activities are reported in All other, net. 7 EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to
holders of common stock by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed assuming the exercise of
stock options and warrants, conversion of preferred stock and debt, and the
issuance of stock as incentive compensation to certain employees. Under these
assumptions, the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding is
increased accordingly, and net earnings is adjusted by the after-tax interest
effects of convertible debt and reduced by an incremental contribution to the
Employee Stock Ownership Plan ESOP. This contribution is the after-tax
difference between 1 the income the ESOP would have received in preferred
stock dividends and 2 the dividend on the common shares assumed to have been
outstanding. The following table reconciles the numerators and denominators of the basic and
diluted earnings per share computations YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31              1999     1999     1998     1998    1997     1997

11 LINES OF CREDIT AND LONG-TERM DEBT
The company has committed borrowing facilities amounting to $1,000 that were
unused as of December 31, 1999. The facilities are in amounts of $500 each and
expire in 2000 and 2004, respectively. The facilities exist largely to support
commercial paper borrowings in the U.S. and Europe. While there are no related
compensating balances, the facilities are subject to various fees. The company
also has uncommitted lines of credit amounting to $422 available with various
international banks, of which $62 were used at December 31, 1999.

Current maturities of long-term debt are included with short-term debt in the
consolidated balance sheets. Annual aggregate maturities of long-term debt
during the next five years are: 2001 19; 2002 66; 2003 13; 2004 5; and,
2005 39. The company has guaranteed $275 original principal amount of ESOP
979% notes due in 2004. At December 31, 1999, the balance of the guarantee was
$218 of which $28 was classified as current. Principal payments that began in
1995 cause the recognition of compensation expense see Note 18. Annual
aggregate maturities of guaranteed debt through expiration are: 2001 35;
2002 44; 2003 53; 2004 58.
In March, the company, through its subsidiary, Sugen, facilitated a private
placement of $28 in 12% Senior convertible notes. The notes are convertible into
common stock and have a conversion price of $3366 per share. In connection with
the issuance of the debt, warrants were issued simultaneously which entitle the
holder to an additional amount of notes with provisions similar to the master
debt. At December 31, 1999, $3 of warrant notes remained unexercised.

12 COMMITMENTS AND OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Future minimum payments under noncancellable operating leases at December 31,
1999, approximately 85 percent real estate and 15 percent equipment, are as
follows: 2000 78; 2001 56; 2002 43; 2003 39; 2004 36 and later
years 156. Capital asset spending committed for construction and equipment but
unexpended at December 31, 1999, was approximately $260.
The consolidated balance sheets include accruals for estimated product
litigation and environmental liabilities. The latter includes exposures related
to discontinued operations, including the industrial chemical facility and
several sites which, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act, are commonly known as Superfund sites see Note
13. The company ultimate liability in connection with Superfund sites depends
on many factors, including the number of other potentially responsible parties,
the financial viability of those parties, and the remediation methods and
technology to be used. Actual costs incurred may vary from the estimates given
the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures.                    -46-
50
With regard to its discontinued industrial chemical facility in North Haven,
Connecticut, the company soon may be required to submit a corrective measures
study report to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA. As the
corrective action process progresses, it may become appropriate to reevaluate
the existing reserves designated for remediation in light of changing
circumstances. It is reasonably possible that a material increase in accrued
liabilities will be required. It is not possible, however, to estimate a range
of potential losses. Accordingly, it is not possible to determine what, if any,
exposure exists at this time. 13 LITIGATION
The company is involved in a number of legal and environmental proceedings.
These include a substantial number of product liability suits claiming damages
as a result of the use of the company products and administrative and judicial
proceedings at several Superfund sites. The company has successfully settled
or otherwise resolved most of the Superfund sites where it has had some alleged
connection.
While it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of legal actions
brought against the company, or the ultimate cost of environmental matters, the
company continues to believe that any potentially unaccrued costs and
liabilities associated with such matters will not have a material adverse effect
on the company consolidated financial position. Unless there is a significant
deviation from the historical pattern of resolution of these issues, there
should not be a material adverse effect on the company consolidated financial
position, its results of operations or liquidity.
The company has been a party along with a number of other defendants both
manufacturers and wholesalers in several federal civil antitrust lawsuits,
which were consolidated and transferred to the Federal District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois. These suits, brought by independent pharmacies
and chains, generally allege unlawful conspiracy, price discrimination and price
fixing and, in some cases, unfair competition. These suits specifically allege
that the company and the other named defendants violated the following: 1 the
Robinson-Patman Act by giving substantial discounts to hospitals, nursing homes,
mail-order pharmacies and health maintenance organizations HMOs without
offering the same discounts to retail drugstores, and 2 Section I of the
Sherman Antitrust Act by entering into illegal vertical combination with other
manufacturers and wholesalers to restrict certain discounts and rebates so they
benefited only favored customers.
The Federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois certified a
national class of retail pharmacies in November 1994. The company announced in
1998 that it reached a settlement with the plaintiffs in the federal class
action case for $103 that was paid during the first quarter of 1999. Similar
actions by proposed retailer classes have been filed in the state courts of
Alabama, California, Minnesota, Mississippi, and Wisconsin. Twenty-three class
action lawsuits seeking damages based on the same alleged conduct have been
filed in 18 states and the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs claim to
represent consumers who purchased prescription drugs in those jurisdictions and
one other state. Two of the lawsuits have been dismissed. Fifteen have been
settled. The company believes that any potential remaining liability above
amounts accrued will not have a material adverse effect on the company
consolidated financial position, its results of operations, or liquidity.                    -47-

14 CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT
The company is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to certain
intercompany and third party transactions, primarily intercompany sales from
Sweden and Italy to other European countries, the U.S. and Japan. The exposures
and related hedging programs are managed centrally using forward currency
contracts, cross-currency swaps and currency options to hedge a portion of both
net recorded currency transaction exposures on the balance sheet as well as net
anticipated currency transactions. The company also has hedged part of its net
investment in Japan. Financial instruments for trading purposes are neither held
nor issued by the company.
The company program to hedge net anticipated currency transaction exposures is
designed to protect cash flows from potentially adverse effects of exchange rate
fluctuations. At December 31, 1999, the contract amount of the company
outstanding contracts used to hedge net transaction exposure was $658. The
aggregate net transaction gains and losses included in net income for the years
ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 related to foreign currency transaction
hedges was $3, $15, and $18, respectively. During 1999, several European
countries began using the euro. This reduces the number of currencies in which
contracts are denominated. Of the total amount of contracts held by the company,
euro-denominated against the U.S. dollar and Swedish krona were 17 percent and
10 percent. U.S. dollar denominated contracts were 19 percent, 6 percent were
denominated in Japanese yen, and 5 percent were denominated in various other
currencies all against the Swedish krona. Of the remaining contracts held by the
company, 36 percent were in U.S. dollars and 7 percent were in euro against
various other currencies in non-significant concentrations.
Gains and losses on hedges of intercompany loans and deposits offset the
currency exchange gains and losses of the underlying loans and deposits. At
December 31, 1999, the contract amount of forward exchange and currency swap
contracts held for balance sheet financial exposure hedging program was $620. Of
these contracts, 75 percent were denominated in U.S. dollars and against
Japanese yen 47 percent, European currencies 11 percent, and various other
currencies 17 percent. Euro denominated contracts amounted to 16 percent of
the total and were against various non-concentrated currencies. The remaining
contracts denominated in other currencies amounted to 9 percent and were against
the Swedish krona and the Japanese yen.
Because the contract amounts are stated as notional amounts, the amount of
contracts disclosed above is not a direct measure of the exposure of the company
through its use of derivatives. These contracts generally have maturities that
do not exceed twelve months and require the company to exchange currencies at
agreed-upon rates at maturity. The counterparties to the contracts consist of a
limited number of major international financial institutions. The company does
not expect any losses from credit exposure. 15 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the company financial
instruments were as follows                    1999      1999      1998      1998

Because maturities are short-term, fair value approximates carrying amount for
cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable,
short-term debt, and accounts payable. Fair values of forward exchange and
currency swap contracts, long-term investments, long-term debt, and guaranteed
ESOP debt were estimated based on quoted market prices for the same or similar
instruments or on discounted cash flows. 16 CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
The company invests excess cash in deposits with major banks throughout the
world and in high quality short-term liquid debt instruments. Such investments
are made only in instruments issued or enhanced by high quality institutions. At
December 31, 1999, the company had no financial instruments that represented a
significant concentration of credit risk. The amounts invested in a single
institution are limited to minimize risk. The company has not incurred credit
risk losses related to these investments.
The company sells a broad range of pharmaceutical products to a diverse group of
customers operating throughout the world. In the U.S. and Japan, the company
makes substantial sales to relatively few large wholesale customers. Credit
limits, ongoing credit evaluation, and account monitoring procedures are
utilized to minimize the risk of loss. Collateral is generally not required. 17 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
PREFERRED STOCK
The Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock is held by the Employee Stock
Ownership Trust ESOP Trust. The per-share stated value is $40,30000 and the
preferred stock ranks senior to the company common stock as to dividends and
liquidation rights. Each share is convertible, at the holder option, into
1,450 shares of the company common stock and has voting rights equal to 1,450
shares of common stock. The company may redeem the preferred stock at any time
after July 20, 1999, or upon termination of the ESOP at a minimum price of
$40,30000 per share. Dividends, at the rate of 625 percent, are cumulative,
paid quarterly, and charged against retained earnings. COMMON STOCK                    -49-
53
The number of common shares outstanding at December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997 was
519,667,495; 518,119,813; and 516,558,279, respectively. On a per-share basis,
dividends were declared on common stock at a rate of $108 in 1999, 1998 and
1997. Common stock dividends payable were $141 and $137 at December 31, 1999 and
1998, respectively.
CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF PAR VALUE
Amounts of paid-in capital that exceed the par value $01 per share of the
company common stock are recorded in this account. The tax benefit related to
the exercise of certain stock options reduces income taxes payable and is
reflected as capital in excess of par. Offsetting this is the difference between
the cost of treasury shares and cash received for them, if any, when used to
satisfy stock option exercises and other employee stock awards.
ESOP-RELATED ACCOUNTS
The company holds a note receivable from the ESOP Trust that matures on February
1, 2005; bears interest at 625 percent; and may be added to or repaid, in whole
or in part, at any time. Accrued interest at the end of any calendar year is
added to the note principal. At December 31, 1999, the note principal balance
was $66. Also, upon recognition of the company guarantee of the debt of the
ESOP Trust, an offsetting amount was recorded in shareholders' equity. As
guaranteed debt is repaid, this amount diminishes correspondingly see Notes 11
and 18. Also, to the extent the company recognizes expense more rapidly than
the corresponding cash contributions are made to the Trust, this account is
reduced. The balance in this account at December 31, 1999, was $182.
TREASURY STOCK
The balance at December 31, 1999 and 1998 was $2 and $35, respectively, carried
at cost.
ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
Accumulated other comprehensive income reflects the cumulative balance of the
following: 1 currency translation adjustments, the adjustments of translating
the financial statements of non-U.S. subsidiaries from local currencies into
U.S. dollars see Note 1; 2 unrealized gains and losses on investments
categorized as available-for-sale, net of deferred taxes and reclassifications
see Note 2; and 3 minimum pension liability adjustments, net of deferred tax
see Notes 2 and 20.
WARRANTS
Certain warrants to purchase shares of common stock were issued in connection
with the Senior Custom Convertible notes, certain collaboration agreements, and
various license, facility and equipment lease financing arrangements. Warrants
to purchase 209,987 shares were outstanding at December 31, 1999 with exercise
prices and expirations ranging between $2535 and $3581 and September 2000 and
April 2004, respectively.
SHAREHOLDER PROTECTION RIGHTS PLAN
In February 1997, the Board of Directors approved a shareholder protection
rights plan, declaring a dividend of one right for each share of the company
common stock outstanding on or after March 7, 1997. Exercisable 10 days after
any person or group acquires 15 percent or more or commences a tender offer for
15 percent or more of the company common stock, the rights entitle holders to
effectively purchase a specified amount of the company common stock at an
exercise price equal to half of its market value. The rights are redeemable for
$01 per right and have a life of 10 years, unless redeemed earlier by the
company. In lieu of cash payment, the company has the option to                    -50-
54
exchange stock for rights unless the acquiring person acquires more than 50
percent of the company common stock. 18 EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN ESOP
The ESOP, created in 1989, is a funding vehicle for the Employee Savings Plan
covering essentially all active U.S. employees. As the ESOP Trust makes debt
principal and interest payments, a proportionate amount of preferred stock is
released for allocation to plan participants. The preferred shares are allocated
to participants' accounts based upon their respective savings plan contributions
and the dividends earned on their previously allocated preferred shares. As of
December 31, 1999, 2,097 preferred shares had been released and allocated; 383
shares were released but unallocated; and 4,212 shares remained unreleased, of
which 61 shares are committed to be released. Shares released during 1999, 1998
and 1997 were 421, 391 and 346, respectively.
Under the agreement whereby the company guaranteed third-party debt of the ESOP
Trust, the company is obligated to provide sufficient cash annually to the Trust
to enable it to make required principal and interest payments. The company
satisfies this annual cash flow requirement through payment of dividends on all
preferred shares outstanding, loans and cash contributions. The company has
fully and unconditionally guaranteed the ESOP Trust payment obligations
whether at maturity, upon redemption, upon declaration of acceleration, or
otherwise. The holders of the debt securities have no recourse against the
assets of the ESOP Trust except in the event that the Trust defaults on payments
due and the company also fails to make such payments. In that event, the holders
may have recourse against unallocated funds held by the Trust. At December 31,
1999, assets of the ESOP trust consisted primarily of $270 of Pharmacia &
Upjohn, Inc., Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock.
ESOP expense is determined by a formula that apportions debt service to each
year of the plan based on shares allocated to participants and deducts dividends
paid on all preferred stock held by the trust. ESOP expense represents a fringe
benefit and, as such, it attaches to payroll costs that comprise a portion of
all functional expense captions in the earnings statement.
Key measures of the ESOP are presented in the table that follows. YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31

19 STOCK COMPENSATION
Incentive and nonqualified stock options are granted to certain employees.
Options granted in 1999 have a ten-year term and vest at the end of three years
or vest pro rata over three years. All options                    -51-
55
have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying stock at date
of grant. Since the company has elected the disclosure-only alternative under
SFAS No. 123 and continues to account for stock options per the terms of APB No.
25, no compensation expense is recognized in earnings.
Upon a stock-for-stock exercise of an option, an active employee will receive a
new, nonqualified reloaded option at the then-current market price for the
number of shares surrendered to exercise the option. The reloaded option will
have an exercise term equal to the remaining term of the original exercised
option.

As of December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, the company had exercisable options of
11,296,000, 11,813,000 and 11,392,000, respectively, with weighted average
exercise prices of $3500, $3665 and $2839, respectively.
Had the company elected to measure stock compensation using the fair value of
the awards at grant date under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the company net
income and diluted earnings per share would have been reduced by approximately
$55 or $11 per share for 1999, $47 or $09 per share for 1998, and $42 or $08
per share for 1997. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
assumptions for 1999                    -52-
56
1998 and 1997, respectively: dividend yield of 198, 270, and 283 percent;
volatility of 248, 240, and 210 percent; risk-free interest rate of 664,
472, and 545 percent; and an expected life of 50, 51, and 53 years. 20 RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The company has various pension plans covering substantially all employees.
Benefits provided under the defined benefit pension plans are primarily based on
years of service and the employee compensation. The company also provides
nonpension benefits to eligible retirees and their dependents, primarily in the
form of medical and dental benefits. The following tables summarize the changes
in benefit obligations and plan assets during 1998 and 1999.                                    OTHER RETIREMENT

The assumption concerning health care cost trend rate has a significant effect
on the amounts reported. Increasing the rate by one percentage point in each
year would increase the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31,
1999, by $55 and the total of service and interest cost components of net
postretirement benefit cost for the year by $6. Conversely, decreasing the rate
by one percentage point in each year would decrease the postretirement benefit
obligation as of December 31, 1999, by $49 and the total of service and interest
cost components of net postretirement benefit cost for the year by $5.
The company has recorded an additional minimum liability of $75 for underfunded
plans at December 31, 1999. This liability represents the amount by which the
accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the sum of the fair market value of plan
assets and accrued amounts previously recorded. An intangible asset $10 to the
extent of previously unrecognized prior service cost offsets the additional
liability. The remaining amount $65 is recorded, net of tax benefits, as a
reduction to shareholders' equity within accumulated other comprehensive income. 21 SEGMENT INFORMATION
The company core business is the development, manufacture and sale of
pharmaceutical products. This business is organized in two segments,
prescription pharmaceutical and consumer health care. The prescription
pharmaceutical segment includes general therapeutics, ophthalmology and hospital
products including oncology, and diversified therapeutics. The consumer health
care segment consists of self-medication products that are available to
consumers over the counter without a prescription. This segment includes product
line extensions of key prescription drugs, plus products to treat tobacco
dependency.
The remaining operating units include animal health, diagnostics, nutrition,
plasma, pharmaceutical commercial services and biotechnology. Due to the size of
these operating segments, they have been included in an all other grouping.
Animal health produces and markets both pharmaceuticals and feed additives for
livestock and pets. Diagnostics provides services to identify specific allergies
in people. Nutrition sells food replacement products, primarily to hospitals.
Plasma is a therapeutic area that prepares and markets products derived from
blood plasma. Pharmaceutical commercial services develops, manufactures and
markets certain bulk pharmaceutical chemicals and selected high-technology and
specialty chemicals. Biotechnology primarily represents minority equity
positions in biotechnology joint ventures that manufacture and market reagents,
chemicals, and systems for biotechnology companies and academic research
laboratories.
The following tables show revenues and expenses for the company operating
segments and reconciling items necessary to total to the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements. Information about segment assets, interest
income and expense, and income taxes is not provided on a segment level as the
segments are reviewed based on operating income. Corporate support functions and
restructuring charges also are not allocated to segments. There are no
inter-segment revenues. Depreciation is not available on a segmental basis.                    -55-

During the fourth quarter of 1999, the company realigned the internal management
organization of the company operating segments and have appropriately
reflected this change in the reportable segments presented. SEGMENTS FOR YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999                      PRESCRIPTION     CONSUMER

resulting from acquisitions by Pharmacia AB prior to the 1995 merger with The
Upjohn Company. In addition to amortization, unallocated noncorporate general
and administrative expenses are included in the reconciling item for operating
income loss before corporate. Corporate and all other amounts represent
general and administrative expenses of corporate support functions, corporate
items such as restructuring charges and litigation accruals, and nonoperating
income and expenses.
The company products are sold throughout the world to a wide range of
customers including pharmacies, hospitals, chain warehouses, governments,
physicians, wholesalers, and other distributors. No single customer accounts for
10 percent or more of the company consolidated sales.
The top selling 20 products in 1999 represent approximately 59 percent of total
sales with no one product constituting more than 7 percent of total sales. The
following table shows the company sales geographically. U.S. exports to
