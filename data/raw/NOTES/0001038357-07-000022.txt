Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information concerning
the impact to oil and gas revenues during 2006, 2005 and 2004 from the Company
hedging activities, the Company open and terminated hedge positions at
December 31, 2006 and descriptions of the Company commodity hedge derivatives.
Also see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
for additional disclosures about the Company commodity related derivative
financial instruments.
Subsequent to December 31, 2006, the Company reduced its oil hedge
positions by terminating certain oil swap contracts and increased its gas hedge
position by adding additional gas swap contracts. See Note J of Notes to
42 Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data for information concerning these changes in the oil and gas
hedge positions.
Deferred revenue. During 2006 and 2005, the Company recognition of
previously deferred VPP revenue increased oil and gas revenues from continuing
operations by $1903 million and $758 million, respectively. The Company
amortization of deferred VPP revenue is scheduled to increase 2007 oil and gas
revenues by $1812 million. See Note T of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for
specific information regarding the Company VPPs.
Interest and other income. The Company interest and other income totaled
$587 million, $315 million and $22 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The $272 million increase during 2006, as compared to 2005, is
primarily attributable to i $138 million of hedge ineffectiveness gains
recorded during 2006, ii a $132 million increase in interest income primarily
attributable to the investing the proceeds from the Argentine and deepwater Gulf
of Mexico divestitures during 2006 and iii $56 million of Alaskan exploration
incentive credits received in 2006, offset by a $66 million decrease in
business interruption insurance claims primarily attributable to the 2005 Fain
plant fire in the West Panhandle field. The increase in interest and other
income during 2005, as compared to 2004, is primarily attributable to the
recognition of $142 million in business interruption insurance claims related
to the Fain plant fire. See Note M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional
information regarding interest and other income.
Gain loss on disposition of assets. The Company recorded a net loss on
disposition of assets of $79 million in 2006, as compared to net gains of $598
million and $39,000 during 2005 and 2004, respectively.
In 2005, the gain was primarily related to i the sale of the stock of a
subsidiary that owned the interest in the Olowi block in Gabon, which resulted
in a $475 million gain and ii a $14 million insurance settlement on the
Company East Cameron facility that was destroyed by Hurricane Rita, which
resulted in a $97 million gain.
During 2006, the Company recognized gains on the sale of its interest in
certain oil and gas properties in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and its Argentina
assets of approximately $7372 million. During 2005, the Company also recognized
gains on the sale of certain assets in Canada and the shelf of the Gulf of
Mexico of approximately $1662 million. However, pursuant to SFAS 144, these
gains and the results of operations  from the assets are presented as
discontinued operations.
The net cash proceeds from asset divestitures during 2006, 2005 and 2004
were used, together with net cash flows provided by operating activities, to
fund additions to oil and gas properties and stock repurchase programs, and to
reduce outstanding indebtedness. See Notes N and V of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data for additional information regarding asset divestitures.
Oil and gas production costs. The Company oil and gas production costs
totaled $3983 million, $3464 million and $2249 million during 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively. In general, lease operating expenses and workover expenses
represent the components of oil and gas production costs over which the Company
has management control, while production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly
related to commodity price changes. Total production costs per BOE increased
during 2006 by 18 percent as compared to 2005 primarily due to i the impact of
a 126 percent increase in delivered volumes under VPP agreements, for which the
Company bears all associated production costs and records no associated sales
volumes representing a per BOE production cost impact of approximately $150
during 2006 as compared to $59 during 2005, ii general inflation of field
service and supply costs and iii increases in production and ad valorem taxes
and field utility costs due to increasing commodity and utility prices.
Total production costs per BOE increased during 2005 by 41 percent as
compared to 2004. The increase in total production costs per BOE during 2005 as
compared to 2004 was primarily attributable to i an increase in production and
ad valorem taxes as a result of higher commodity prices, ii higher Canadian
gas transportation fees, iii the retention of production costs related to VPP
volumes sold approximately $59 per BOE, during 2005, iv new production
added from the Evergreen merger, which are relatively higher per BOE operating
cost properties and v increases in field service and supply costs primarily
associated with rising commodity prices.
43   The following tables provide the components of the Company total
production costs per BOE and total production costs per BOE by geographic area

$1109   $ 936   $ 662   Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense. The Company total DD
expense was $1001, $811 and $681 per BOE for 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD expense, was
$934, $756 and $646 per BOE during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During
2006, the increase in per BOE depletion expense was primarily due to i a
generally increasing trend in the Company oil and gas properties' cost bases
per BOE of proved and proved developed reserves as a result of cost inflation in
drilling rig rates and drilling supplies, ii the aforementioned sale of proved
reserves under VPP agreements, for which the Company removed proved reserves
with no corresponding decrease in cost basis, iii a $50 per BOE increase in
Tunisian depletion, primarily associated with 2006 and 2005 decreases in the
Company interest in the Adam Concession, offset by iv a $391 per BOE
decrease in South Africa depletion, primarily associated with 2006 and 2005
positive revisions to proved reserves based on well performance.
During 2005, the increase in per BOE depletion expense was due to
relatively higher per BOE cost basis Rocky Mountains area production acquired in
the Evergreen merger and a higher depletion rate for the Hugoton and Spraberry
fields as a result of the VPP volumes sold.
The following table provides depletion expense per BOE from continuing
operations by geographic area for 2006, 2005 and 2004                              Year Ended December 31,

assets to be held and used, including oil and gas properties, whenever events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be
recoverable. During 2005 and 2004, the Company recognized noncash impairment
charges of $644 thousand and $397 million, respectively, to reduce the carrying
value of its Gabonese Olowi field assets as development of the discovery was
canceled. See Critical Accounting Estimates below and Notes B and S of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data for additional information pertaining to the Company
accounting policies regarding assessments of impairment and the Gabonese Olowi
field impairment, respectively.

During 2006, significant components of the Company dry hole provisions
and leasehold  abandonments expense included i $340 million of costs
associated with the Company unsuccessful exploratory well on its Block 256
prospect offshore Nigeria, including $178 million of associated unproved
leasehold impairment, ii $216 million of dry hole provisions recorded for the
Company unsuccessful Cronus, Storms and Antigua prospects in the North Slope
area of Alaska, iii $184 million of dry hole provisions and abandonment costs
recognized on prospects drilled in prior periods that were being evaluated for
commerciality, including $72 million of costs associated with the Company
Boomslang prospect offshore South Africa, $70 million of costs associated with
two discoveries on the Gulf of Mexico shelf in 2005 and $42 million of costs
associated with the Company Anaguid permit in Tunisia, iv $160 million of
dry hole provision and unproved property impairment recognized on the Company
unsuccessful Norphlet prospect in Mississippi, v a $143 million unsuccessful
well on the Company Flying Cloud prospect in the Gulf of Mexico and vi $64
million of unsuccessful exploratory wells in Canada. During 2006, the Company
completed and evaluated 414 exploration/extension wells, 384 of which were
successfully completed as discoveries.
Significant components of the Company dry hole expense during 2005
included i $212 million related to Alaskan well costs, ii $95 million
associated with an unsuccessful Nigerian well, iii $35 million attributable
to an unsuccessful suspended well in the Company El Hamra permit in Tunisia,
iv $51 million attributable to an unsuccessful suspended well in the
Company Anaguid permit in Tunisia and v various other exploratory wells.
During 2005, the Company completed and evaluated 180 exploratory/extension
wells, 149 of which were successfully completed as discoveries.
Significant components of the Company dry hole expense during 2004
included i $190 million on the Company Gabonese Olowi prospect and ii
$58 million associated with the Company Bravo prospect offshore Equatorial
Guinea.  During  2004,  the  Company  completed  and  evaluated  103
exploratory/extension  wells, 58 of which were successfully completed as
discoveries.
General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense
totaled $1218 million, $1142 million and $732 million during 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expense during
2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to a full year effect of the 2005
staff increases associated with the Evergreen acquisition. The Company continues
to review its general and administrative expenses and remains focused on
initiatives to control its expenditures.
45   The increase in general and administrative expense during 2005, as compared
to 2004, was primarily due to increases in administrative staff, including staff
increases  associated with the Evergreen merger, and  performance-related
compensation costs, including the amortization of restricted stock awarded to
officers, directors and employees during 2005.
Interest expense. Interest expense was $1070 million, $1261 million and
$1020 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The weighted average
interest rate on the Company indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2006
was 67 percent, as compared to 65 percent and 54 percent for the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, including the effects of interest rate
derivatives. The decrease in interest expense for 2006 as compared to 2005 was
primarily due to the repayment of portions of the Company outstanding
borrowings  under the Company  credit facility with proceeds from the
divestiture of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets and an $111
million increase in interest capitalized on the Company Oooguruk development
project in Alaska and the South Coast Gas project in South Africa, partially
offset by a $41 million decrease in the amortization of interest rate hedge
gains.
The increase in interest expense for 2005 as compared to 2004 was primarily
due to increased average borrowings under the Company lines of credit,
primarily as a result of the cash portion of the consideration paid in the
Evergreen merger and $9493 million of stock repurchases completed during 2005,
a $152 million decrease in the amortization of interest rate hedge gains, the
assumption of $300 million of notes in connection with the Evergreen merger and
higher interest rates in 2005.
See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item
8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information about
the Company long-term debt and interest expense.
Hurricane activity, net. The Company recorded net hurricane related
activity expenses of $320 million and $398 million during 2006 and 2005,
respectively, associated with the Company East Cameron platform facility,
located on the Gulf of Mexico shelf, that was destroyed during 2005 by Hurricane
Rita.
The Company does not plan to rebuild the facility based on the economics of
the field. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company application to reef
in-place a substantial portion of the East Cameron debris was denied. As a
result, the Company currently estimates that it will cost approximately $119
million to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facility. The estimate to
reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facility is based upon an analysis and fee
proposal prepared by a third-party engineering firm for the majority of the work
and an estimate by the Company for the remainder. During 2006 and 2005, the
Company recorded additional abandonment obligation charges of $75 million and
$398 million, respectively. The operations to reclaim and abandon the East
Cameron facilities began in January 2007 and the Company expects to incur a
substantial portion of the costs in 2007. The Company expects that a substantial
portion of the total estimated cost to reclaim and abandon the facility will be
covered by insurance, including 100 percent of the debris removal costs.
Consequently, the Company has recorded a $430 million insurance recovery
receivable corresponding to the estimated debris removal costs.
Other expenses. Other expenses were $363 million during 2006, as compared
to $994 million during 2005 and $284 million during 2004. The $631 million
decrease in other expenses during 2006, as compared to 2005, is primarily
attributable to i a $532 million decrease in hedge ineffectiveness charges
and other derivative losses and ii a $179 million decrease in loss on early
extinguishment of portions of the Company senior notes.
The increase in other expenses during 2005, as compared to 2004, is
primarily attributable to i a $439 million increase in hedge ineffectiveness
and other derivative losses and ii a $260 million loss on the redemption and
tender of portions of the Company senior notes. See Note O of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data for a detailed description of the components included in
other expenses.
46   Income tax provision. The Company recognized income tax provisions on
continuing operations of $1367 million, $1558 million and $631 million during
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company effective tax rates for 2006,
2005 and 2004 were 442 percent, 445 percent and 319 percent, respectively, as
compared to the combined United States federal and state statutory rates of
approximately 365 percent. The effective tax rates of 2006 and 2005 differ from
the combined United States federal and state statutory rates primarily due to   o foreign tax rates,
o adjustments to the deferred tax liability for changes in enacted tax laws
and rates, as discussed below,
o statutes in foreign jurisdictions that differ from those in the United
States,
o recognition of $84 million of deferred tax benefit during 2006 as a
result of the conversion of senior convertible notes prior to the
Company repayment of the debt principal,
o recognition of $72 million of taxes during 2005 associated with the
repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004 and
o expenses for unsuccessful well costs and associated acreage costs in
foreign locations where the Company does not expect to receive income tax
benefits.
During May 2006, the State of Texas enacted legislation that changed the
existing Texas franchise tax from a tax based on net income or taxable capital
to an income tax based on a defined calculation of gross margin the Texas
margin tax. Also, during 2006, the Canadian federal and provincial governments
enacted tax rate reductions that will be phased in over several years. SFAS No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes requires that deferred tax balances be
adjusted to reflect tax rate changes during the periods in which the tax rate
changes are enacted. The adjustment due to the enactment of the Texas margin tax
and the Canadian tax rate changes resulted in a $135 million United States tax
expense and a $102 million Canadian tax benefit during the year ended December
31, 2006, respectively.
See Critical Accounting  Estimates below and Note P of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Company tax
position.
Discontinued operations. During 2005 and 2006, the Company sold its
interests in the following oil and gas asset groups  Country        Description of Asset Groups      Date Divested

million during 2004. Pursuant to SFAS 144, the results of operations of these
properties and the related gains on disposition are reported as discontinued
operations. See Note V of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional data on discontinued
operations.
Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity
Capital commitments.  The Company primary needs for cash are for
exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, repayment of
contractual  obligations  and working  capital  obligations.  Funding for
exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties and repayment
of  contractual  obligations  may be  provided  by any  combination  of
internally-generated cash flow, proceeds from the disposition of nonstrategic
47 assets or alternative financing sources as discussed in Capital resources and
Financing activities below. Generally, funding for the Company working
capital obligations is provided by internally-generated cash flows.
Payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired. In 2004, the Company paid
$8804 million of cash, net of $121 million of cash acquired, and issued shares
of the Company common stock to complete the Evergreen merger. The Company also
assumed $300 million principal amount of Evergreen notes and other current and
noncurrent obligations associated with the Evergreen merger. As is further
discussed in Financing  activities below, and in Note C of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data, the Company financed the cash costs utilizing credit
facilities.
Oil and gas properties. The Company cash expenditures for additions to
oil and gas properties during 2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled $14 billion, $11
billion and $5629 million, respectively. The Company 2006 expenditures for
additions to oil and gas properties were funded by $7548 million of net cash
provided by operating activities and by a portion of the net proceeds from the
disposition of deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets. The Company 2005
and 2004 expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties were internally
funded by $13 billion and $11 billion, respectively, of net cash provided by
operating activities.
The Company strives to maintain its indebtedness at levels which will
provide  sufficient  financial  flexibility  to take advantage of future
opportunities. The Company capital budget for 2007 is approximately $11
billion. The Company believes that Credit Agreement borrowings and net cash
provided by operating activities during 2007, based on the current price
environment, will be sufficient to fund the 2007 capital expenditures budget.
Off-balance sheet arrangements. From time-to-time, the Company enters into
off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material
off-balance sheet obligations of the Company. As of December 31, 2006, the
material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that the Company has
entered into include i undrawn letters of credit, ii operating lease
agreements, iii drilling commitments, iv VPP obligations to physically
deliver volumes and pay related lease operating expenses in the future and v
contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed
and determinable such as derivative contracts that are sensitive to future
changes in commodity prices and gas transportation commitments. Other than the
off-balance sheet arrangements described above, the Company has no transactions,
arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other
persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company liquidity
or availability of or requirements for capital resources. See Contractual
obligations below for more information regarding the Company off-balance
sheet arrangements.
Contractual obligations. The Company contractual obligations include
long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments including commitments to
pay day rates for drilling rigs, derivative obligations, other liabilities,
transportation commitments and VPP obligations.
The following table summarizes by period the payments due by the Company
for contractual obligations estimated as of December 31, 2006                                Payments Due by Year

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the
Company post retirement benefit obligations, litigation contingencies and
asset retirement obligations, respectively.
f Transportation commitments represent estimated transportation fees on gas
throughput commitments. See Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data for additional information regarding the Company transportation
commitments.
g These amounts represent the amortization of the deferred revenue associated
with the VPPs. The Company ongoing obligation is to deliver the specified
volumes sold under the VPPs free and clear of all associated production
costs and capital expenditures. See Note T of Notes to Consolidated
Financial  Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data.   Environmental contingency. A subsidiary of the Company has been notified by
a letter from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality TCEQ dated
August 24, 2005 that the TCEQ considers the subsidiary to be a potentially
responsible party with respect to the Dorchester Refining Company State
Superfund Site located in Mount Pleasant, Texas. In connection with the
acquisition of oil and gas assets in 1991, the Company acquired a group of
companies, one of which was an entity that had owned a refinery located at the
Mount Pleasant site from 1977 until 1984. According to the TCEQ, this refinery
was responsible for releases of hazardous substances into the environment.
Pursuant to applicable Texas law, the Company subsidiary, which does not own
any material assets or conduct any material operations, may be subject to
strict, joint and several liability for the costs of conducting a study to
evaluate potential remedial options and for the costs of performing any
remediation ultimately required by the TCEQ. The Company does not know the
nature and extent of the alleged contamination, the potential costs of
remediation or the portion, if any, of such costs that may be allocable to the
Company subsidiary; however, the Company has noted that there appear to be
other operators or owners who may share responsibility for these costs and does
not expect that any such additional liability will have a material adverse
effect on its consolidated financial position as a whole or on its liquidity,
financial position or future annual results of operations. See Note I of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding this matter as well
as other environmental and legal contingencies involving the Company.
Capital resources. The Company primary capital resources are net cash
provided by operating activities, proceeds from financing activities and
proceeds from sales of nonstrategic assets. The Company expects that these
resources will be sufficient to fund its capital commitments during 2007 and for
the foreseeable future.
49   Asset divestitures. During March 2006, the Company sold all of its
interests in certain oil and gas properties in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for
net proceeds of $12 billion, resulting in a gain of $7262 million. During
April 2006, the Company sold its Argentine assets for net proceeds of $6696
million, resulting in a gain of $109 million. The results of operations for
these divestitures are included in the Company discontinued operations. The
net cash proceeds from these divestitures were used to reduce outstanding
indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, to fund a portion of additions to oil
and gas properties, for stock repurchases and for general corporate purposes.
During May 2005, the Company sold all of its interests in the Martin Creek,
Conroy Black and Lookout Butte oil and gas properties in Canada for net proceeds
of $1972 million, resulting in a gain of $1383 million. During August 2005,
the Company sold all of its interests in certain oil and gas properties on the
Gulf of Mexico shelf for net proceeds of $592 million, resulting in a gain of
$279 million. During October 2005, the Company sold all of its shares in a
subsidiary that owns the interest in the Olowi block in Gabon for net proceeds
of $479 million, resulting in a gain of $475 million. The net cash proceeds
from the 2005 divestitures were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness.
During January 2005, the Company sold 205 MMBOE of proved reserves, by
means of two VPPs for net proceeds of $5923 million, including the assignment
of the Company obligations under certain derivative hedge agreements. Proceeds
from the VPPs were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness.
During April 2005, the Company sold 73 MMBOE of proved reserves, by means
of another VPP for net proceeds of $3003 million, including the assignment of
the Company obligations under certain derivative hedge agreements. Proceeds
from the VPP were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness.
See Note T of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item
8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information
regarding the Company VPPs.
Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities during
2006, 2005 and 2004 was $7548 million, $13 billion and $11 billion,
respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2006,
as compared to that of 2005, was primarily due to the loss of cash flow from the
aforementioned asset divestitures. The increase in net cash provided by
operating activities in 2005, as compared to that of 2004, was primarily due to
higher commodity prices and the operations acquired in the Evergreen merger.
Investing activities. Net cash provided by investing activities during 2006
was $1455 million, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of
$847 million during 2005 and net cash used in investing activities of $15
billion during 2004. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities
during 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to a $3962 million increase
in proceeds from disposition of assets, partially offset by a $2806 million
increase in additions to oil and gas properties. The decrease in net cash used
in investing activities during 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to
i $12 billion in proceeds from asset divestitures in 2005, which included
$8926 million of net proceeds received from VPPs sold during 2005 and ii
$8804 million of cash consideration paid in 2004 in connection with the
Evergreen merger offset by an increase of $5604 million in additions to oil and
gas properties. See Results of Operations above and Note N of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data for additional information regarding asset divestitures.
Financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $9135
million and $14 billion during 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net cash provided
by financing activities during 2004 was $4143 million. During 2006, significant
components of financing activities included $5547 million of net cash used to
repay long-term borrowings, $3489 million of net cash used to purchase 89
million shares of stock and $317 million of dividend payments, partially offset
by $174 million of proceeds from the exercise of long-term incentive plan stock
options and employee stock purchases. During 2005, financing activities were
comprised of $3536 million of net principal repayments on long-term debt, $601
million of payments of other noncurrent liabilities, primarily comprised of cash
settlements of acquired hedge obligations, $303 million of dividends paid and
$9493 million of stock repurchases, partially offset by $416 million of
proceeds from the exercise of long-term incentive plan stock options and
employee stock purchases. During 2004, financing activities were comprised of
$5534 million of net principal borrowings on long-term debt, $543 million of
50 payments of other noncurrent liabilities, primarily comprised of settlements of
fair value and acquired hedge obligations and other financial obligations, $923
million of stock repurchases and $266 million of dividends paid, partially
offset by $351 million of proceeds from the exercise of long-term incentive
plan stock options and employee stock purchases.
During September 2005, the Company announced that the Board had approved a
share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $1 billion of the
Company common stock. During 2006 and 2005, the Company expended a total of
$3489 million to acquire 89 million shares of stock and $9493 million to
acquire 200 million shares of stock, respectively, of which $3453 million and
$9403 million, respectively, were repurchased pursuant to the repurchase
programs. In February 2007, the Board approved a new share repurchase program
authorizing the purchase of up to $300 million of the Company common stock.
During May 2006, the Company issued $450 million of 6875% Notes for net
proceeds of $4474 million. The Company used the net proceeds, in part, from the
6875% Notes to repurchase $3462 million of its 650% Notes and for general
corporate purposes.
During 2006, holders of all of the $100 million of 4 3/4% Senior
Convertible Notes due 2021 exercised their conversion rights. Associated
therewith, the Company paid $799 million in cash, issued 23 million shares of
common stock and recorded a $220 million increase to stockholders' equity.
During September 2005, the Company entered into an amended credit facility
that provides for initial aggregate loan commitments of $15 billion and a
five-year term the Credit  Agreement.  Effective September 2006, the
participating lenders extended the maturity on $1395 billion of aggregate loan
commitments under the Credit Agreement to September 30, 2011.
During April 2005, $1310 million of the Company 8 7/8% senior notes due
2005 matured and were repaid. During 2005, the Company also redeemed the
remaining $640 million and $162 million, respectively, of aggregate principal
amount of its 9 5/8% senior notes due 2010 and its 750% senior notes due 2012.
During September 2005, the Company accepted tenders to purchase $1884 million
in principal amount of the 5875% senior notes due 2012 for $1999 million. The
Company utilized unused borrowing capacity under its credit facility to fund
these financing activities.
As the Company pursues its strategy, it may utilize various financing
sources, including fixed and floating rate debt, convertible securities,
preferred stock or common stock. The Company may also issue securities in
exchange for oil and gas properties, stock or other interests in other oil and
gas companies or related assets. Additional securities may be of a class
preferred to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and
liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined
by the Board.
Liquidity. The Company principal source of short-term liquidity is the
Credit Agreement. There was $3280 million of outstanding borrowings under the
Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2006. Including $1502 million of undrawn
and outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Agreement, the Company had
$10 billion of unused borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2006.
Debt ratings. The Company receives debt credit ratings from Standard &
Poor Ratings Group, Inc. S and Moody Investor Services,  Inc.
Moody, which are subject to regular reviews. During 2005, S lowered the
Company corporate credit rating to BB+ with a stable outlook from BBB-. During
2006, Moody cut the Company corporate credit rating to Ba1 with a negative
outlook from Baa3. S and Moody consider many factors in determining the
Company ratings, including: production growth opportunities, liquidity, debt
levels and asset and reserve mix. As a result of the downgrades, the interest
rate and fees the Company pays on the Credit Agreement have increased and
additional debt covenant requirements under the Credit Agreement were triggered.
During 2006, as a result of the Company downgrades by the rating agencies, the
Company issued additional letters of credits of approximately $791 million
pursuant to agreements that contain provisions with rating triggers. The
individual downgrades are not expected to materially affect the Company
financial position or liquidity, but could negatively impact the Company
ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate, fees and other
terms associated with such additional financing.
51   Book capitalization and current ratio. The Company book capitalization at
December 31, 2006 was $45 billion, consisting of debt of $15 billion and
stockholders' equity of $30 billion. Consequently, the Company debt to book
capitalization decreased to 33 percent at December 31, 2006 from 48 percent at
December 31, 2005. The Company ratio of current assets to current liabilities
was 60 to 100 at December 31, 2006, essentially unchanged from December 31,
2005.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements for inclusion in
this Report in accordance with GAAP. See Note B of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data for a comprehensive discussion of the Company significant accounting
policies. GAAP represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules
and requirements, the application of which requires management judgments and
estimates including, in certain circumstances, choices between acceptable GAAP
alternatives.  Following is a discussion of the Company most critical
accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the
Company application of GAAP.
Asset retirement obligations. The Company has significant obligations to
remove tangible equipment and facilities and to restore land or seabed at the
end of oil and gas production operations. The Company removal and restoration
obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and
removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Estimating the future
restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make
estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years
in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of
what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly
changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public
relations considerations.
Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and
judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit
adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement and changes in the legal,
regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future
revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset
retirement obligations, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas
property balance. See Notes B and L of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for
additional information regarding the Company asset retirement obligations.
Successful  efforts method of accounting.  The Company utilizes the
successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities as
opposed to the alternate acceptable full cost method. In general, the Company
believes that, during periods of active exploration, net assets and net income
are more conservatively measured under the successful efforts method of
accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under the full cost method.
The critical difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and
the full cost method is as follows: under the successful efforts method,
exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical exploration costs are
charged against earnings during the periods in which they occur; whereas, under
the full cost method of accounting, such costs and expenses are capitalized as
assets, pooled with the costs of successful wells and charged against the
earnings of future periods as a component of depletion expense. During 2006,
2005 and 2004, the Company recognized exploration, abandonment, geological and
geophysical expense from i continuing operations of $2641 million, $1633
million and $1134 million, respectively, and ii discontinued operations of
$73 million, $639 million and $683 million, respectively,  under the
successful efforts method.
Proved reserve estimates. Estimates of the Company proved reserves
included in this Report are prepared in accordance with GAAP and SEC guidelines.
The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of   o the quality and quantity of available data   o the interpretation of that data   o the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and
52   o the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.
The Company proved reserve information included in this Report as of
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was prepared by the Company engineers and
audited by independent petroleum engineers with respect to the Company major
properties. Estimates prepared by third parties may be higher or lower than
those included herein.
Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, all of which may
substantially differ from future actual results, reserve estimates will be
different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered. In
addition, results of drilling, testing and production after the date of an
estimate may justify, positively or negatively, material revisions to the
estimate of proved reserves.
It should not be assumed that the Standardized Measure included in this
Report as of December 31, 2006 is the current market value of the Company
estimated proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the Company
based the Standardized Measure on prices and costs on the date of the estimate.
Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices
and costs as of the date of the estimate. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for
additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves.
The Company estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion
expense. If the estimates of proved reserves decline, the rate at which the
Company records depletion expense will increase, reducing future net income.
Such a decline may result from lower market prices, which may make it
uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields. In addition, a decline
in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the Company assessment
of its proved properties and goodwill for impairment.
Impairment of proved oil and gas properties. The Company reviews its proved
properties to be held and used whenever management determines that events or
circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may
not be recoverable. Management assesses whether or not an impairment provision
is necessary based upon its outlook of future commodity prices and net cash
flows that may be generated by the properties and if a significant downward
revision has occurred to the estimated proved reserves. Proved oil and gas
properties are reviewed for impairment at the level at which depletion of proved
properties is calculated.
Impairment of unproved oil and gas properties. Management periodically
assesses unproved oil and gas properties for impairment, on a project-by-project
basis. Management assessment of the results of exploration activities,
commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion
of such projects impacts the amount and timing of impairment provisions, if any.
Suspended wells. The Company suspends the costs of exploratory wells that
discover hydrocarbons pending a final determination of the commercial potential
of the oil and gas discovery. The ultimate disposition of these well costs is
dependent on the results of future drilling activity and development decisions.
If the Company decides not to pursue additional appraisal activities or
development of these fields, the costs of these wells will be charged to
exploration and abandonment expense.
The Company generally does not carry the costs of drilling an exploratory
well as an asset in its Consolidated Balance Sheets for more than one year
following the completion of drilling unless the exploratory well finds oil and
gas reserves in an area requiring a major capital expenditure and both of the
following conditions are met    i The well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its
completion as a producing well.
ii The Company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and
the economic and operating viability of the project.
Due to the capital intensive nature and the geographical location of
certain Alaskan, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and foreign projects, it may take the
Company longer than one year to evaluate the future potential of the exploration
well and economics associated with making a determination on its commercial
viability. In these instances, the project feasibility is not contingent upon
price improvements or advances in technology, but rather the Company ongoing
efforts and expenditures related to accurately predicting the hydrocarbon
recoverability based on well information, gaining access to other companies                    53 production, transportation or processing facilities and/or getting partner
approval to drill additional appraisal wells. These activities are ongoing and
being pursued constantly. Consequently, the Company assessment of suspended
exploratory well costs is continuous until a decision can be made that the well
has found proved reserves or is noncommercial and is impaired. See Note D of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the
Company suspended exploratory well costs.
Assessments of functional currencies. Management determines the functional
currencies of the Company subsidiaries based on an assessment of the currency
of the economic environment in which a subsidiary primarily realizes and expends
its operating revenues, costs and expenses. The U.S. dollar is the functional
currency of all of the Company international operations except Canada. The
assessment of functional currencies can have a significant impact on periodic
results of operations and financial position.
Argentine economic and currency measures. In April 2006, the Company sold
its assets in Argentina for proceeds of $6696 million, resulting in a gain of
$109 million. Prior to the divestiture, the accounting for and remeasurement of
the Company Argentine balance sheets as of December 31, 2005 reflect
management assumptions regarding some uncertainties unique to Argentina
economic environment. The Argentine economic and political situation continues
to evolve and the Argentine government may enact future regulations or policies
that, when finalized and adopted, may materially impact, among other items, the
timing of repatriations of the sales proceeds and contingent liabilities
associated with the Company retained obligations and its indemnifications
provided to the purchaser of the assets. See Item 7A. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note B of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data for a description of the assumptions utilized in the preparation of these
financial statements.
Deferred tax asset valuation allowances. The Company continually assesses
both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than
not that its deferred tax assets will be realized prior to their expiration.
Pioneer monitors Company-specific, oil and gas industry and worldwide economic
factors and reassesses the likelihood that the Company net operating loss
carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes in each jurisdiction will be
utilized prior to their expiration. There can be no assurances that facts and
circumstances will not materially change and require the Company to establish
deferred tax asset valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions in a future
period. As of December 31, 2006, the Company does not believe there is
sufficient positive evidence to reverse its valuation allowances related to
certain foreign tax jurisdictions.
Goodwill impairment. The Company reviews its goodwill for impairment at
least annually. This requires the Company to estimate the fair value of the
assets and liabilities of the reporting units that have goodwill. There is
considerable judgment involved in estimating fair values, particularly in the
estimation of proved reserves as described above. See Note B of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data for additional information.
Litigation and environmental contingencies. The Company makes judgments and
estimates in recording liabilities for ongoing litigation and environmental
remediation. Actual costs can vary from such estimates for a variety of reasons.
The costs to settle litigation can vary from estimates based on differing
interpretations of laws and opinions and assessments on the amount of damages.
Similarly, environmental remediation liabilities are subject to change because
of changes in laws and regulations, developing information relating to the
extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology. Under
GAAP, a liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if the Company
determines the loss to be both probable and reasonably estimable. See Note I of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the
Company commitments and contingencies.
Valuations of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. The Company
is the sponsor of certain defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. In
accordance with GAAP, the Company is required to estimate the present value of
its unfunded pension and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. Based
on those values, the Company records the unfunded obligations of those plans and
records ongoing service costs and associated interest expense. The valuation of
the Company pension and accumulated  postretirement benefit obligations
requires management assumptions and judgments as to benefit cost inflation
factors, mortality rates and discount factors. Changes in these factors may
materially  change  future  benefit  costs and pension  and  accumulated
postretirement benefit obligations. See New Accounting Pronouncements below
54 and Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.
Consolidated  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional
information regarding the Company pension and accumulated postretirement
benefit obligations.
Valuation of stock-based compensation. The Company adopted the modified
prospective approach as prescribed under SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006.
Under this approach, the Company is required to expense all options and other
stock-based compensation that vested during the year of adoption based on the
fair value of the award on the grant date. The calculation of the fair value of
stock-based compensation requires the use of estimates to derive the various
inputs necessary for using the Black-Scholes valuation method elected by the
Company.
New Accounting Pronouncements
The following  discussions  provide information about new accounting
pronouncements that were issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB during 2006   FIN 48. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN No. 48. The Interpretation clarifies
the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold
that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial
statements. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on measurement, classification,
interim accounting and disclosure. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is continuing to assess the
potential impacts of this Interpretation.
SFAS 157. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value
Measures SFAS 157. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measures required
under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as
to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is continuing to
assess the impact of SFAS 157.
SFAS 158. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158, Employers'
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and other Postretirement Plans SFAS
158.  Under SFAS 158, a business  entity that  sponsors one or more
single-employer defined benefit plans is required to  o  recognize the funded status of a benefit plan in its balance sheet,
measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value with
limited exceptions and the benefit obligation,
o  recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the
gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the
period, but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit
cost,
o  measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of
the employer fiscal year-end statement of financial position and
o  disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information
about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal
year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior
service costs or credits, and transition assets or obligations.
An employer with publicly traded securities is required to initially
recognize the funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans and to
provide the required disclosures as of the end of the first fiscal year ending
after December 15, 2006. The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS 158
effective on December 31, 2006. The Company previously recognized the funded
status of its defined benefit postretirement plans and currently recognizes
periodic changes in its defined benefit postretirement plans as components of
service costs in the period of change as allowed by SFAS 158. Consequently, the
adoption of SFAS 158 did not have a material impact on the Company liquidity,
financial position or future results of operations. See Note H of Notes to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary  Data for additional  information  regarding the Company
postretirement plans.
55 ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about
financial instruments to which the Company was a party as of December 31, 2006
and 2005, and from which the Company may incur future gains or losses from
changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices.
Although certain derivative contracts to which the Company has been a party did
not qualify as hedges, the Company does not enter into derivative or other
financial instruments for trading purposes.
The fair value of the Company derivative contracts is determined based on
counterparties' estimates and valuation models. The Company did not change its
valuation method during 2006. During 2006, the Company was a party to commodity,
interest rate and foreign exchange rate swap contracts and commodity collar
contracts. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information
regarding the Company derivative contracts, including deferred gains and
losses on terminated derivative contracts. The following table reconciles the

respectively, for which no market risk exists.
b At inception, new derivative contracts entered into by the Company have no

Foreign exchange rate sensitivity. From time-to-time,  the Company
Canadian subsidiary enters into short-term forward currency agreements to
purchase Canadian dollars with U.S. dollar gas sales proceeds. The Company does
not designate these derivatives as hedges due to their short-term nature. There
were no outstanding forward currency agreements at December 31, 2006.                    56   Interest rate sensitivity. The following tables provide information about
other financial instruments to which the Company was a party as of December 31,
2006 and 2005 that were sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt
obligations, the tables present maturities by expected maturity dates, the
weighted average interest rates expected to be paid on the debt given current
contractual terms and market conditions and the debt estimated fair value. For
fixed rate debt, the weighted average interest rate represents the contractual
fixed rates that the Company was obligated to periodically pay on the debt as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005. For variable rate debt, the average interest rate
represents the average rates being paid on the debt projected  forward
proportionate to the forward yield curve for LIBOR on February 19, 2007. As of
December 31, 2006, the Company was not a party to material derivatives that
would subject it to interest rate sensitivity.               Interest Rate Sensitivity

December 31, 2006 and 2005, all of the Company oil and gas derivative
financial instruments qualified as hedges.
57   Commodity hedge instruments. The Company hedges commodity price risk with
derivative contracts, such as swap and collar contracts. Swap contracts provide
a fixed price for a notional amount of sales volumes. Collar contracts provide
minimum floor and maximum ceiling prices for the Company on a notional
amount of sales volumes, thereby allowing some price participation if the
relevant index price closes above the floor price.

Non-derivative financial instruments. The Company is a borrower under fixed
rate and variable rate debt instruments that give rise to interest rate risk.
The Company objective in borrowing under fixed or variable rate debt is to
satisfy capital requirements while minimizing the Company costs of capital.
See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a discussion of the Company
debt instruments.
Derivative financial instruments. The Company utilizes interest rate,
foreign exchange rate and commodity price derivative contracts to hedge interest
rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity price risks in accordance with
policies and guidelines approved by the Board. In accordance with those policies
and guidelines, the Company executive management determines the appropriate
timing and extent of hedge transactions.
Foreign currency, operations and price risk. International investments
represent, and are expected to continue to represent, a significant portion of
the Company total assets. Pioneer currently has international operations in
Africa and Canada, which together represented 18 percent of the Company 2006
oil and gas revenues. Although Pioneer primary focus is directed toward
onshore North American opportunities,  Pioneer continues to identify and
selectively evaluate other international opportunities. As a result of such
foreign operations, Pioneer financial results and international operations
could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates,
changes in the legal or regulatory environment, weak economic conditions or
changes in political or economic climates and other factors. For example   o local political and economic developments could restrict or increase the
cost of Pioneer foreign operations   o exchange controls and currency fluctuations could result in financial
losses   o royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims could increase
costs of Pioneer foreign operations   o expropriation of the Company property could result in loss of revenue,
property and equipment   o civil uprising, riots, terrorist attacks and wars could make it
impractical to continue operations, resulting in financial losses   o compliance with applicable U.S. law could be in conflict with the
Company contractual obligations, the laws of foreign governments or
local customs   o import and export regulations and other foreign laws or policies could
result in loss of revenues   o repatriation levels for export revenues could restrict the availability
of cash to fund operations outside a particular foreign country and
o laws and policies of the U.S. affecting foreign trade, taxation and
investment could restrict Pioneer ability to fund foreign operations
or may make foreign operations more costly.
Pioneer does not currently maintain political risk insurance. Pioneer
evaluates on a country-by-country basis whether obtaining political risk
coverage is necessary and may add such insurance in the future if the Company
believes it is prudent to do so.
Argentina. During April 2006, the Company sold its Argentine assets for net
proceeds of $6696 million, resulting in a gain of $109 million. The results of
operations from the Argentine operations are being presented as discontinued
operations.
During the decade of the 1990s, Argentina government pursued free market
policies, including the privatization of state-owned companies, deregulation of
the oil and gas industry, tax reforms to equalize tax rates for domestic and
foreign investors, liberalization of import and export laws and the lifting of
60 exchange controls. The cornerstone of these reforms was the 1991 convertibility
law that established an exchange rate of one Argentine peso to one U.S. dollar.
These policies were successful as evidenced by the elimination of inflation and
substantial economic growth during the early to mid-1990s. However, throughout
the decade, the Argentine government failed to balance its fiscal budget,
repeatedly incurring significant fiscal deficits such that by the end of 2001
Argentina had accumulated $130 billion of debt.
During 2001, Argentina found itself in a critical economic situation with
the combination of high levels of external indebtedness, a financial and banking
system in crisis, a country risk rating that had reached levels beyond the
historical norm, a high level of unemployment and an economic contraction that
had lasted four years.
Late in 2001, the country was unable to obtain additional funding from the
International Monetary Fund. Economic instability increased, resulting in
substantial withdrawals of cash from the Argentine banking system over a short
period of time. The government was forced to implement monetary restrictions and
placed limitations on the transfer of funds out of the country without the
authorization of the Central Bank of the Republic of Argentina.
In January 2002, the government defaulted on a significant portion of
Argentina $130 billion of debt and the national Congress passed Emergency Law
25,561,  which, among other things,  overturned the long standing,  but
unsustainable, convertibility plan. The government adopted a floating rate of
exchange in February 2002. Two specific provisions of the Emergency Law directly
impacted the Company. First, a tax on the value of hydrocarbon exports was
established effective March 1, 2002. The second provision was the requirement
that domestic commercial transactions, or contracts, for sales in Argentina that
were previously denominated in U.S. dollars be converted to pesos i.e.,
pesofication at an exchange rate to be negotiated between sellers and buyers.
Furthermore, the government placed a price freeze on gas prices at the wellhead.
With the price of gas pesofied and frozen, the U.S. dollar-equivalent price of
gas in Argentina fell in direct proportion to the level of devaluation.
The abandonment of the convertibility plan and the decision to allow the
peso to float in international exchange markets resulted in significant
devaluation of the peso. By September 30, 2002, the peso-to-U.S. dollar exchange
rate had increased from 1:1 to 374:1. However, since the end of the third
quarter of 2002, the peso-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate had stabilized at
approximately 300:1.
As a result of the Argentine  economic  instability and government
regulation, the Company i received prices for the oil and gas it produced at
prices significantly below those received in its other operating areas, ii
curtailed the investment the Company made in Argentina and iii ultimately led
the Company to dispose of its Argentine assets. The Company is currently
winding-up the affairs associated with its remaining Argentine entity. The
Company is still exposed to the uncertainties surrounding the Argentine economic
and political situation until the Company completes i the distribution of its
remaining sales proceeds to the United States, ii the liquidation of its
remaining Argentine entity and iii its obligations under the indemnifications
and retained obligations related to the divestiture of the Argentine assets.
Africa. The Company producing assets in Africa are in South Africa and
Tunisia. The Company views the operating environment in these African nations as
stable and the economic stability as good. The Company also has an exploration
program in the developing West African countries of Equatorial Guinea and
Nigeria. While the values of the various African nations' currencies fluctuate
in relation to the U.S. dollar, the Company believes that any currency risk
associated with Pioneer African operations would not have a material impact on
the Company results of operations given that such operations are closely tied
to oil prices, which are denominated in U.S. dollars.
Canada. The Company views the operating environment in Canada as stable and
the economic stability as good. A portion of the Company Canadian revenues and
substantially all of its costs are denominated in Canadian dollars. While the
value of the Canadian dollar fluctuates in relation to the U.S. dollar, the
Company believes that any currency risk associated with its Canadian operations
would not have a material impact on the Company results of operations.
61   As of December 31, 2006, the Company primary risk exposures associated
with financial instruments to which it is a party include oil and gas price
volatility, volatility in the exchange rates of the Canadian dollar vis a vis
the U.S. dollar and interest rate volatility. The Company primary risk
exposures associated with financial instruments have not changed significantly
since December 31, 2006.                    62 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA          Index to Consolidated Financial Statements                                      Page

ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Pioneer Natural Resources Company   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pioneer
Natural Resources Company the Company as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, cash
flows and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
the Company at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.
As discussed in Note B to the consolidated financial statements, in 2006
the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R,
Share-Based Payment and No. 158 Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Postretirement Plans.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of the

Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements. Preparation of
the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Depletion of oil and gas properties and impairment
71             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 of goodwill and oil and gas properties, in part, is determined using estimates
of proved oil and gas reserves. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in the
estimation of quantities of proved reserves and in the projection of future
rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. Similarly,
evaluations for impairment of proved and unproved oil and gas properties are
subject to numerous uncertainties including, among others, estimates of future
recoverable reserves; commodity price outlooks; foreign laws, restrictions and
currency exchange rates; and export and excise taxes. Actual results could
differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized.
Argentina. In April 2006, the Company sold its Argentine assets and is
currently winding-up the affairs associated with its remaining Argentine entity.
As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company used exchange rates of 306 pesos
to $1 and 303 pesos to $1, respectively, to remeasure the peso-denominated
monetary assets and liabilities of the Company Argentine subsidiaries. The
Company remains exposed to uncertainties surrounding the Argentine economic and
political environment until the Company completes i the distribution of its
remaining sales proceeds to the United Sates, ii the liquidation of its
remaining Argentine entity and iii its obligations under the indemnifications
and retained obligations related to the divesture of the Argentine assets.
Cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and
depository accounts held by banks.
Investments. Investments in unaffiliated equity securities that have a
readily determinable fair value are classified as trading securities if
management current intent is to hold them for the near term; otherwise, they
are accounted for as available-for-sale securities. The Company reevaluates
the classification of investments in unaffiliated equity securities at each
balance  sheet  date.  The  carrying  value of trading  securities  and
available-for-sale securities are adjusted to fair value as of each balance
sheet date.
Unrealized holding gains are recognized for trading securities in interest
and other income, and unrealized holding losses are recognized in other expense
during the periods in which changes in fair value occur.
Unrealized holding gains and losses are recognized for available-for-sale
securities as credits or charges to stockholders' equity and other comprehensive
income loss during the periods in which changes in fair value occur. Realized
gains and losses on the divestiture of available-for-sale securities are
determined using the average cost method. The Company had no investments in
available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2006 or 2005.
Investments in unaffiliated equity securities that do not have a readily
determinable fair value are measured at the lower of their original cost or the
net realizable value of the investment. The Company had no significant equity
security investments that did not have a readily determinable fair value as of
December 31, 2006 or 2005.
Inventories. Inventories were comprised of $937 million and $773 million
of materials and supplies and $14 million and $24 million of commodities as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company materials and supplies
inventory is primarily comprised of oil and gas drilling or repair items such as
tubing, casing, chemicals, operating supplies and ordinary maintenance materials
and parts. The materials and supplies inventory is primarily acquired for use in
future drilling operations or repair operations and is carried at the lower of
cost or market, on a weighted average cost basis. Commodities inventory is
carried at the lower of average cost or market, on a first-in, first-out basis.
Any impairments of inventory are reflected in gain loss on disposition of
assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2006 and
2005, the Company materials and supplies inventory was net of $42 million and
$2 million, respectively, of valuation reserve allowances.
Oil and gas properties. The Company utilizes the successful efforts method
of accounting for its oil and gas properties. Under this method, all costs
associated with productive wells and nonproductive development wells are
capitalized while nonproductive exploration costs and geological and geophysical
expenditures are expensed. The Company capitalizes interest on expenditures for
significant development projects, generally when the underlying project is
sanctioned, until such projects are ready for their intended use.
The Company generally does not carry the costs of drilling an exploratory
well as an asset in its Consolidated Balance Sheets for more than one year
following the completion of drilling unless the exploratory well finds oil and
gas reserves in an area requiring a major capital expenditure and both of the
following conditions are met                    72             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004   i The well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its
completion as a producing well.
ii The Company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and
the economic and operating viability of the project.
Due to the capital intensive nature and the geographical location of
certain Alaskan, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and foreign projects, it may take the
Company longer than one year to evaluate the future potential of the exploration
well and economics associated with making a determination on its commercial
viability. In these instances, the project feasibility is not contingent upon
price improvements or advances in technology, but rather the Company ongoing
efforts and expenditures related to accurately predicting the hydrocarbon
recoverability based on well information, gaining access to other companies'
production, transportation or processing facilities and/or getting partner
approval to drill additional appraisal wells. These activities are ongoing and
being pursued constantly. Consequently, the Company assessment of suspended
exploratory well costs is continuous until a decision can be made that the well
has found proved reserves or is noncommercial and is impaired. See Note D for
additional information regarding the Company suspended exploratory well costs.
The Company owns interests in seven natural gas processing plants and seven
treating facilities. The Company operates five of the plants and all seven
treating facilities. The Company ownership interests in the natural gas
processing plants and treating facilities is primarily to accommodate handling
the Company gas production and thus are considered a component of the capital
and operating costs of the respective fields that they service. To the extent
that there is excess capacity at a plant or treating facility, the Company
attempts to process third party gas volumes for a fee to keep the plant or
treating facility at capacity. All revenues and expenses derived from third
party gas volumes processed through the plants and treating facilities are
reported as components of oil and gas production costs. Third party revenues
generated from the plant and treating facilities for the three years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $385 million, $392 million and $321
million, respectively. Third party expenses attributable to the plants and
treating facilities for the same respective periods were $64 million, $138
million and $118 million. The capitalized costs of the plants and treating
facilities are included in proved oil and gas properties and are depleted using
the unit-of-production method along with the other capitalized costs of the
field that they service.
Capitalized costs relating to proved properties are depleted using the
unit-of-production method based on proved reserves. Costs of significant
nonproducing properties, wells in the process of being drilled and development
projects are excluded from depletion until such time as the related project is
completed and proved reserves are established or, if unsuccessful, impairment is
determined.
Proceeds from the sales of individual properties and the capitalized costs
of  individual  properties  sold or abandoned are credited and charged,
respectively,  to accumulated  depletion,  depreciation and  amortization.
Generally, no gain or loss is recognized until the entire amortization base is
sold. However, gain or loss is recognized from the sale of less than an entire
amortization base if the disposition is significant enough to materially impact
the depletion rate of the remaining properties in the depletion base.
In accordance with SFAS No. 144, the Company reviews its long-lived assets
to be held and used, including proved oil and gas properties accounted for under
the successful efforts method of accounting, whenever events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. An
impairment loss is indicated if the sum of the expected future cash flows is
less than the carrying amount of the assets. In this circumstance, the Company
recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the
asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.
Unproved oil and gas properties are periodically assessed for impairment on
a project-by-project basis. The impairment assessment is affected by the results
of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or
expiration of all or a portion of such projects. If the quantity of potential
reserves determined by such evaluations is not sufficient to fully recover the

Goodwill. As described in Note C, the Company recorded $3278 million of
goodwill  associated  with the merger  with  Evergreen  Resources,  Inc.
Evergreen. The goodwill was recorded to the Company United States
reporting unit. In accordance with EITF Abstract Issue No. 00-23, Issues
Related to the Accounting for Stock Compensation under APB Opinion No. 25 and
FASB Interpretation No. 44, the Company has reduced goodwill by $180 million
since September 28, 2004 for tax benefits associated with the exercise of
fully-vested stock options assumed in conjunction with the Evergreen merger. In
accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill
is not amortized to earnings, but is assessed for impairment whenever events or
circumstances indicate that impairment of the carrying value of goodwill is
likely, but no less often than annually. If the carrying value of goodwill is
determined to be impaired, it is reduced for the impaired value with a
corresponding charge to pretax earnings in the period in which it is determined
to be impaired. During the third quarter of 2006, the Company performed its
annual assessment of impairment of the goodwill and determined that there was no
impairment.
Other property, plant and equipment, net. Other property, plant and
equipment is stated at cost and primarily consists of items such as heavy
equipment and rigs,  furniture and fixtures and leasehold  improvements.
Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful life of the assets using the
straight-line method. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, other property, plant and
equipment was net of accumulated depreciation of $1453 million and $1315
million, respectively.
Asset retirement obligations. The Company accounts for asset retirement
obligations in accordance with SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations SFAS 143. SFAS 143 amended SFAS No. 19, Financial Accounting
and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies to require that the fair value
of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in
which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Under
the provisions of SFAS 143, asset retirement  obligations are generally
capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long-lived asset.
In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 143 FIN 47. FIN 47 clarifies that conditional asset retirement
obligations meet the definition of liabilities and should be recognized when
incurred if their fair values can be reasonably estimated. The interpretation
was adopted by the Company on December 31, 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 had no
impact on the Company financial position or results of operations.
Derivatives and hedging. The Company follows the provisions of SFAS No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS
133.  SFAS 133 requires the accounting  recognition of all derivative
instruments as either assets or  liabilities at fair value.  Derivative
instruments that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through net
income. Under the provisions of SFAS 133, the Company may designate a derivative
instrument as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a
liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular
risk a fair value hedge or as hedging the exposure to variability in
expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk a cash
flow hedge. Both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis, a fair
value hedge must be expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting
changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk during the periods that a
hedge is designated. Similarly, a cash flow hedge must be expected to be highly
effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk
during the term of the hedge. The expectation of hedge effectiveness must be
supported by matching the essential terms of the hedged asset, liability or
forecasted transaction to the derivative hedge contract or by effectiveness
assessments using statistical measurements. The Company policy is to assess
hedge effectiveness at the end of each calendar quarter.
Under the provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative
instruments that are fair value hedges are offset against changes in the fair
value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through net income.
Effective changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are cash flow
hedges are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss - net
deferred hedge losses, net of tax AOCI - Hedging in the stockholders' equity
section of the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets until such time as the
74             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004
hedged items are recognized in net income. Ineffective portions of a derivative
instrument change in fair value are immediately recognized in earnings.
See Note J for a description of the specific types of derivative
transactions in which the Company participates.
Environmental. The Company environmental expenditures are expensed or
capitalized depending on their future economic benefit. Expenditures that relate
to an existing condition caused by past operations and that have no future
economic benefits are expensed. Expenditures that extend the life of the related
property or mitigate or prevent future  environmental  contamination are
capitalized. Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessment and/or
remediation is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such
liabilities are undiscounted unless the timing of cash payments for the
liability is fixed or reliably determinable.
Treasury stock. Treasury stock purchases are recorded at cost. Upon
reissuance, the cost of treasury shares held is reduced by the average purchase
price per share of the aggregate treasury shares held. During 2006, the Company
retired 229 million treasury shares resulting in a reduction in treasury stock
of $10 billion.
Revenue recognition. The Company does not recognize revenues until they are
realized or realizable and earned.  Revenues are considered realized or
realizable and earned when: i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, iii the seller
price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is
reasonably assured.
The Company uses the entitlements method of accounting for oil, natural gas
liquid NGL and gas revenues. Sales proceeds in excess of the Company
entitlement are included in other liabilities and the Company share of sales
taken by others is included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets.
The Company had no material oil or NGL entitlement assets or liabilities as
of December 31, 2006 or 2005. The following table presents the Company gas
entitlement assets and liabilities and their associated volumes as of December
31, 2006 and 2005                              December 31,

123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R to account for
stock-based compensation. Among other items, SFAS 123R eliminates the use of
the Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB 25, intrinsic value method of accounting and requires
companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for
awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards
in the financial statements. The Company elected to use the modified prospective
method for adoption of SFAS 123R, which requires compensation expense to be
recorded for all unvested stock options and other equity-based compensation
beginning in the first quarter of adoption. For all unvested stock options
outstanding as of January 1, 2006, the previously measured but unrecognized
compensation expense, based on the fair value on the date of grant, was
recognized in the Company financial statements over their remaining vesting
periods, which ended in August 2006. For equity-based compensation awards
granted or modified subsequent to January 1, 2006, compensation expense, based
on the fair value on the date of grant, is being recognized in the Company
financial  statements over the vesting period. The Company utilizes the
Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options
and utilizes the stock price on the date of grant for the fair value of
restricted stock awards. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company
followed the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB 25 to account for
stock options. Prior period financial statements have not been restated. The
modified prospective method requires the Company to estimate forfeitures in
75             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004
calculating the expense related to stock-based compensation as opposed to its
prior policy of recognizing forfeitures as they occurred. The Company recorded
no cumulative effect as a result of adopting SFAS 123R.
Additionally, under the provisions of SFAS 123R, deferred compensation
recorded under APB 25 related to equity-based awards should be eliminated
against the appropriate equity accounts. As a result, upon adoption of SFAS
123R, the Company eliminated $458 million of deferred compensation cost in
stockholders' equity and reduced a like amount of additional paid-in capital in
the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company recorded $321 million of
compensation costs for all stock-based plans. The impact to net income of
adopting SFAS 123R was $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, or
less than $02 per diluted share. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the
adoption impact is comprised of $959 thousand of compensation expense associated
with stock options and $669 thousand of compensation expense associated with the
Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP, which is a compensatory
plan under the provisions of SFAS 123R.
Pursuant to the provisions of SFAS 123R, the Company issued shares, as
reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006
and 2005, do not include 1,946,211 shares and 1,756,180 shares, respectively,
related to unvested restricted stock awards.
As of December 31, 2006, there was approximately $398 million of
unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share-based compensation
plan awards, primarily related to restricted stock awards. This compensation
will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting periods
of the awards, which is a remaining period of less than three years.
The following table illustrates the pro forma effect on net income and net
income per share as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition
provisions of SFAS No. 123R to stock-based compensation during the years ended

income taxes.   Foreign currency translation. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency
for all of the Company international operations except Canada. Accordingly,
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are remeasured
to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting
period; revenues and costs and expenses denominated in a foreign currency are
remeasured at the average of the exchange rates that were in effect during the

period in which the revenues and costs and expenses were recognized. The
resulting gains or losses from remeasuring foreign currency denominated balances
into U.S. dollars are recorded in other income or other expense, respectively.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are
remeasured at the historic exchange rates that were in effect when the assets or
liabilities were acquired or incurred.
The functional currency of the Company Canadian operations is the
Canadian dollar. The financial statements of the Company Canadian subsidiaries
are translated to U.S. dollars as follows: all assets and liabilities are
translated using the exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting
period; revenues and costs and expenses are translated using the average of the
exchange rates that were in effect during the period in which the revenues and
costs and expenses were recognized. The resulting gains or losses from
translating  non-U.S.  dollar  denominated  balances are recorded in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity for the period

Company reduced its exploration and abandonments expense by $398 million for
the year ended December 31, 2005, which represents  reclassification of
abandonment costs for the Company East Cameron facility destroyed by Hurricane
Rita to hurricane activity, net expense on the accompanying Consolidated

New  accounting  pronouncements.  The following  discussions  provide
information about new accounting pronouncements that were issued by FASB during
2006   FIN 48. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48. The Interpretation clarifies the
accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that
a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial
statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on measurement, classification,
interim accounting and disclosure. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is continuing to assess the
potential impacts of this Interpretation.
SFAS 157. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value
Measures SFAS 157. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measures required
under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as
to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is continuing to
assess the impact, if any, of SFAS 157.
SFAS 158. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158, Employers'
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and other Postretirement Plans SFAS
158.  Under SFAS 158, a business  entity that  sponsors one or more
single-employer defined benefit plans is required to                    77             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

o recognize the funded status of a benefit plan in its balance sheet,
measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value with limited
exceptions and the benefit obligation,
o recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the
gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the
period, but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit
cost,
o measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the
employer balance sheet and
o disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information
about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal
year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior
service costs or credits, and transition assets or obligations.
An employer with publicly traded securities is required to initially
recognize the funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans and to
provide the required disclosures as of the end of the first fiscal year ending
after December 15, 2006. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 158
effective on December 31, 2006. The Company previously recognized the funded
status of its defined benefit postretirement plans and currently recognizes
periodic changes in its defined benefit postretirement plans as components of
service costs in the period of change as allowed by SFAS 158. Consequently, the
adoption of SFAS 158 did not have a material impact on the Company liquidity,
financial position or future results of operations. See Note H of Notes to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary  Data for additional  information  regarding the Company
postretirement plans.
NOTE C.   Acquisitions
Evergreen merger. On September 28, 2004, Pioneer completed a merger with
Evergreen, with Pioneer being the surviving corporation for accounting purposes.
The transaction was accounted for as a purchase of Evergreen by Pioneer. As a
result, the financial statements for the Company prior to September 28, 2004 are
those of Pioneer only. The merger with Evergreen was accomplished through the
issuance of 254 million shares of Pioneer common stock and $8511 million of
cash paid to Evergreen shareholders at closing, net of $121 million of acquired
cash. The cash consideration paid in the merger was financed through borrowings
on the Company credit facilities.
The Company recorded $3278 million of goodwill associated with the
Evergreen merger, which represented the excess of the purchase consideration
over the net fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Permian Basin and Onshore Gulf Coast acquisitions. During 2006 and 2005,
the Company spent $712 million and $1678 million, respectively, to acquire
various working interests primarily in the Spraberry and South Texas areas.
NOTE D.   Exploratory Well Costs
The Company capitalizes exploratory well costs until a determination is
made that the well has either found proved reserves or that it is impaired. The
capitalized exploratory well costs are presented in proved properties in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the exploratory well is determined to be
impaired, the well costs are charged to expense.                    78             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004
The following  discussion describes the history and status of each
significant suspended exploratory project   Clipper. During 2005, the Company drilled its first exploratory well on the
Clipper prospect, which was a discovery. During 2006, the Company drilled
additional wells to determine the magnitude of the discovery. The Company is
currently evaluating the plans for development of the discovery, including
evaluating sub-sea tie-back options to third-party production and handling
facilities in the area.
Ozona Deep and Thunder Hawk. During March 2006, the Company sold its
interests in the Ozona Deep and Thunder Hawk properties as part of the Company
deepwater Gulf of Mexico divestiture. See Note N for additional information
regarding the Company divestiture of its deepwater Gulf of Mexico oil and gas
assets.
Oooguruk. During 2003, the Company Alaskan Oooguruk discovery wells found
quantities of oil believed to be commercial. In 2003, the Company began farm-in
discussions with the owner of undeveloped discoveries in adjacent acreage given
its proximity and the potential cost benefits of a larger scale project. The
farm-in was completed during 2004. Along with completing the farm-in agreement,
Pioneer obtained access to exploration well and seismic data to improve the
Company understanding of the potential of the discoveries without having to
drill additional wells. In late 2004, the Company completed an extensive
technical and economic evaluation of the resource potential and a front-end
engineering design study FEED study for the area.
During the first quarter of 2006, the Company sanctioned the development of
the discovery and obtained the necessary regulatory approvals. The Company
installed an offshore gravel drilling and production site during the 2006 winter
construction season and completed armoring activities during the third quarter.
A sub-sea flowline and facilities will be installed during 2007 to carry
produced liquids to existing onshore processing facilities at the Kuparuk River
Unit. Pioneer plans to drill approximately 40 horizontal wells to develop the
discovery. Depending on weather conditions and facilities completion and
accessibility, drilling could begin as early as the fall of 2007. The Company
estimates first production will occur in 2008.
South Africa. During 2001, the Company drilled two South African discovery
wells that found quantities of gas and condensate believed to be commercial.
From 2002 to 2004, the Company actively reviewed the gas supply and demand
fundamentals in South Africa and had discussions with a gas-to-liquids GTL
plant in the area to purchase the condensate and gas. During 2004, a FEED study
was authorized for the gas development and infrastructure design. The FEED study
was completed in early 2005 and based on that study, the GTL plant operator
initiated purchase orders for long-lead time infrastructure components. In
December 2005, the Company announced the final approvals with its partner in the
South Coast gas project to commence the initial development of the project. As a
result, the Company added 114 million Bbls oil equivalent MMBOE of proved
reserves in 2005 and reduced the suspended exploratory costs by $77 million.
During 2000, the Company drilled two South African exploratory wells in the
Company Boomslang prospect. One well was unsuccessful, but the other well
found quantities of hydrocarbons believed to be commercial. The Boomslang
discovery was not included in the initial development phase of the South Coast
Gas project. Boomslang is an oil discovery with a significant gas cap. The
Company believes the Boomslang discovery may ultimately be developed as a gas
discovery, but commercialization plans have not progressed sufficiently to allow
the Company to continue to capitalize the exploratory costs related to the
discovery. Accordingly, the Company expensed the Boomslang discovery in the
fourth quarter of 2006.
Tunisia - Anaguid. During 2003, the Company drilled two exploration wells
on its Anaguid Block in Tunisia which found quantities of condensate and gas
believed to be commercial. During 2004, the wells were scheduled and approved
for extended production tests. However, the project operator delayed the
extended production tests due to issues unrelated to the Company or the project.
During 2005, the project operator, along with the Company, conducted an extended
production test of one of the two existing exploration wells and drilled an
offset appraisal well to the other exploration well.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004
The results of the extended production test were unfavorable and the
Company expensed $51 million associated with this well in 2005. However, the
appraisal well offsetting the second discovery encountered gas and condensate in
a similar horizon to the initial well. The Company has concluded studies on the
appraisal well with unfavorable results and expensed $42 million in the fourth
quarter of 2006. Studies on the second discovery will continue to determine
whether development is economical.

Commodity price swap and collar contracts, interest rate swaps and foreign
currency swap contracts. The fair value of commodity price swap and collar
contracts, interest rate swaps and foreign currency contracts are estimated from
quotes provided by the counterparties to these derivative contracts and
represent the estimated amounts that the Company would expect to receive or pay
to settle the derivative contracts. See Note J for a description of each of
these derivatives, including whether the derivative contract qualifies for hedge
accounting treatment or is considered a speculative derivative contract.
Financial  assets.  The carrying amounts of the trading  securities
approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The fair
value of the notes receivable approximates the carrying value at December 31,
2006 due to the proximity of the execution dates of the notes to December 31.
The current portion of the notes receivable, amounting to $51 million and $4
million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, is included in other
current assets, net in the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets. The trading
securities and the noncurrent portions of the notes receivable are included in
other assets, net in the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Long-term debt. The carrying amount of borrowings outstanding under the
Company corporate credit facility approximates fair value because these
instruments bear interest at variable market rates. The fair values of each of
the senior note issuances were determined based on quoted market prices for each
of the issues. See Note F for additional information regarding the Company
long-term debt.

the Company common stock at a discounted price. Officers of the Company are
not eligible to participate in the ESPP. Contributions to the ESPP are limited
to 15 percent of an employee pay subject to certain ESPP limits during the
eight-month offering period. Participants in the ESPP purchase the Company
common stock at a price that is 15 percent below the closing sales price of the
Company common stock on either the first day or the last day of each offering
period, whichever closing sales price is lower.
Postretirement Benefit Obligations
As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had recorded $198 million
and $186 million, respectively, of unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit
obligations, the current and noncurrent portions of which are included in other
current liabilities and other liabilities and minority interests, respectively,
in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. These obligations are comprised
of five plans of which four relate to predecessor entities that the Company
acquired in prior years. These plans had no assets as of December 31, 2006 or
2005. Other than the Company retirement plan, the participants of these plans
are not current employees of the Company.
As of December 31, 2006, the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations
pertaining to these plans were determined by independent actuaries for four
plans representing $157 million of unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit
obligations and by the Company for one plan representing $41 million of
unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. Interest costs at an
annual rate of 595  percent of the periodic  undiscounted  accumulated
postretirement benefit obligations were employed in the valuations of the
benefit obligations. Certain of the aforementioned plans provide for medical and
dental cost subsidies for plan participants. Annual medical cost escalation
trends of 10 percent in 2007, declining to five percent in 2012 and thereafter,
and annual dental cost escalation trends of seven percent in 2007, declining to
five percent in 2011 and thereafter, were employed to estimate the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligations associated with the medical and dental cost
subsidies.                    87             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

plans for the year ending December 31, 2007 are $15 million and $22 million,
respectively.
As discussed above in Note B, the Company has adopted the provisions of
SFAS 158 effective on December 31, 2006. The Company previously recognized the
funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans and currently
recognizes periodic changes in its defined benefit postretirement plans as
components of service costs in the period of change as allowed by SFAS 158.
Consequently, the adoption of SFAS 158 did not have a material impact on the
Company liquidity, financial position or future results of operations for the
year ended December 31, 2006.
NOTE I.   Commitments and Contingencies
Severance agreements. The Company has entered into severance and change in
control agreements with its officers, subsidiary company officers and certain
key employees. The current annual salaries for the parent company officers, the
subsidiary company officers and key employees covered under such agreements
total $354 million.
Indemnifications. The Company has indemnified its directors and certain of
its officers, employees and agents with respect to claims and damages arising
from acts or omissions taken in such capacity, as well as with respect to
certain litigation.
Legal actions. The Company is party to the legal actions that are described
below. The Company is also party to other proceedings and claims incidental to
its business. While many of these matters involve inherent uncertainty, the
Company believes that the amount of the liability, if any, ultimately incurred
with respect to such other proceedings and claims will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company consolidated financial position as a whole or on
its liquidity, capital resources or future annual results of operations. The
Company will continue to evaluate its litigation matters on a quarter-by-quarter
basis and will adjust its litigation reserves as appropriate to reflect its
assessment of the then current status of litigation.
Alford. The Company is party to a 1993 class action lawsuit filed in the
26th Judicial District Court of Stevens County, Kansas by two classes of royalty
owners, one for each of the Company gathering systems connected to the
Company Satanta gas plant. The plaintiffs in the case assert that they were
improperly charged expenses primarily field compression, which plaintiffs
allege are a cost of production, and for which the plaintiffs claim they, as
royalty owners, are not responsible. Plaintiffs also claim that they are
entitled to 50 percent of the value of the helium extracted at the Company
Satanta gas plant.
During the third quarter of 2006, the Company reached an agreement to
settle the claims made in the lawsuit. Under the terms of the agreement, the
Company agreed to make cash payments to settle the plaintiffs' claims with
respect to production occurring on and before December 31, 2005. The Company
portion of the cash payments is expected to be $327 million, of which
approximately $170 million was paid during the third quarter of 2006 and the
88             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004
remaining approximately $157 million will be paid in the third quarter of 2007.
The Company also agreed to adjust the manner in which royalty payments to the
class members will be calculated for production occurring on and after January
1, 2006, which change is not expected to have a material effect on the Company
liquidity, financial position or future results of operations.
Final approval was received from the Court on February 9, 2007, and the
settlement is expected to be final within 60 days of final approval assuming no
appeals are filed. If no appeals are made or if any appeals made are resolved,
it is expected that the settlement will be final in the second quarter of 2007.
MOSH Holding. On April 11, 2005, the Company and its principal United
States subsidiary, Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc., were named as defendants
in MOSH Holding, L.P. v Pioneer Natural Resources Company; Pioneer Natural
Resources USA, Inc.; Woodside Energy USA Inc.; and JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA, as
Trustee of the Mesa Offshore Trust, which is before the Judicial District Court
of Harris County, Texas 334th Judicial District. On December 8, 2006,
Dagger-Spine  Hedgehog Corporation  Dagger-Spine  filed a Petition In
Intervention in the lawsuit to assert the same claims as MOSH Holding, L.P.
MHLP. MHLP and Dagger-Spine collectively, Plaintiffs are unitholders in
the Trust, which was created in 1982 as the sole limited partner in a
partnership that holds an overriding royalty interest in certain oil and gas
leases offshore Louisiana and Texas. The Company owns the managing general
partner interest in the partnership. Plaintiffs allege that the Company,
together with Woodside Energy USA Inc. Woodside, concealed the value of
the royalty interest and worked to terminate the Mesa Offshore Trust prematurely
and to capture for itself and Woodside profits that belong to the Mesa Offshore
Trust MOT. Plaintiffs also allege breaches of fiduciary duty, misapplication
of trust property, common law fraud, gross negligence, and breach of the
conveyance agreement for the overriding royalty interest. The relief sought by
the plaintiffs includes monetary and punitive damages and certain equitable
relief, including an accounting of expenses, a setting aside of certain
farmouts, and a temporary and permanent injunction.
The Trustee and the Company have reached a conditional settlement of all
claims in the lawsuit that MOT has or might have against the Company. Plaintiffs
are not signatories to the settlement and they, or other unitholders of MOT, may
comment on or object to the settlement. The settlement is subject to certain
conditions and is not final until approved by the court and any appeals are
resolved. The court has set the settlement review hearing for May 21, 2007.
Dorchester Refining Company Site. A subsidiary of the Company has been
notified by a letter from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality TCEQ
dated August 24, 2005 that the TCEQ considers the subsidiary to be a potentially
responsible party with respect to the Dorchester Refining Company State
Superfund Site located in Mount Pleasant, Texas. In connection with the
acquisition of oil and gas assets in 1991, the Company acquired a group of
companies, one of which was an entity that had owned a refinery located at the
Mount Pleasant site from 1977 until 1984. According to the TCEQ, this refinery
was responsible for releases of hazardous substances into the environment.
Pursuant to applicable Texas law, the Company subsidiary, which does not own
any material assets or conduct any material operations, may be subject to
strict, joint and several liability for the costs of conducting a study to
evaluate potential remedial options and for the costs of performing any
remediation ultimately required by the TCEQ. The Company does not know the
nature and extent of the alleged contamination, the potential costs of
remediation or the portion, if any, of such costs that may be allocable to the
Company subsidiary; however, the Company has noted that there appear to be
other operators or owners who may share responsibility for these costs and does
not expect that any such additional liability will have a material adverse
effect on its consolidated financial position as a whole or on its liquidity,
financial position or future annual results of operations.
Environmental Protection Agency Investigation. On November 4, 2005, the
Company learned from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that the agency
was conducting a criminal investigation into a 2003 spill that occurred at a
Company-operated drilling rig located on an ice island offshore Harrison Bay,
Alaska. The investigation is being conducted in conjunction with the U.S.
Attorney Office for the District of Alaska. The spill was previously
investigated by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation ADEC
and, following completion of a clean up, the ADEC issued a letter stating its
determination that, at that time, the site did not pose a threat to human
health, safety or welfare, or the environment. The Company is fully cooperating
with the government investigation.

Argentine obligations. The Company has provided the purchaser of its
Argentine assets certain indemnifications and remains responsible for certain
contingent liabilities, subject to defined limitations. The Company does not
currently believe that these obligations, which primarily pertain to matters of
litigation, environmental contingencies, royalty obligations and income taxes,
are probable of having a material impact on its liquidity, financial position or
future results of operations.
Lease agreements. The Company leases offshore production facilities,
drilling rigs, equipment and office facilities under noncancellable operating
leases. Rental expenses associated with these operating leases for the years
ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were approximately $468 million, $645
million and $518 million, respectively, which includes $87 million, $260
million and $154 million,  respectively,  associated  with  discontinued
operations. Future minimum lease commitments under noncancellable operating
leases at December 31, 2006 are as follows in thousands

Thereafter.   $      Drilling commitments. The Company periodically enters into contractual
arrangements under which the Company is committed to expend funds to drill wells
in the future. The Company also enters into agreements to secure drilling rig
services, which require the Company to make future minimum payments to the rig
operators. The Company records drilling commitments in the periods in which well
capital is expended or rig services are provided.
Transportation agreements. Associated with the Evergreen merger, the
Company assumed gas transportation commitments for specified volumes of gas per
year through 2014. During 2006, the Company expanded these commitments to
support  production  increases,  primarily in the Raton gas field.  The
transportation  commitments averaged approximately 190 million cubic feet
MMcf of gross gas sales volumes per day during 2006, including associated
fuel commitments. These commitments will average approximately 201 MMcf of gross
gas volumes per day during 2007, decrease to approximately 198 MMcf of gross gas
volumes per day during 2008, and decline thereafter to approximately 69 MMcf of
gross gas volumes per day during 2013, before terminating in January 2014.
The Company Canadian subsidiaries are parties to pipeline transportation
service agreements, with aggregate remaining terms of approximately 10 years,
whereby they have committed to transport specified volumes of gas each year
principally from Canada to a point in Chicago, Illinois. Such gas volumes
totaled approximately 86 MMcf of gas per day during 2006 and 78 MMcf of gas per
day during 2005 and 2004, and are comprised of a significant portion of the
Company Canadian net gas production, augmented with certain volumes purchased
at market prices in Canada. The committed volumes to be transported under the
pipeline transportation service agreements are approximately 85 MMcf of gas per
day during 2007 and decline to approximately 75 MMcf of gas per day by the end
of the commitment term. The net gas marketing gains or losses resulting from
purchasing third party gas in Canada and selling it in Chicago are recorded as
other income or other expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Associated with these agreements, the Company recognized $20 and
$41 million of gas marketing gains in other income during the years ended
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $12 million of gas marketing
losses in other expense during the year ended December 31, 2004.

Thereafter.   $ 170,546 NOTE J.   Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses financial derivative contracts to manage exposures to
commodity price, interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company
generally does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative
or trading purposes. The Company also may enter physical delivery contracts to
effectively provide commodity price hedges. Because these contracts are not
expected to be net cash settled, they are considered to be normal sales
contracts and not derivatives. Therefore, these contracts are not recorded in
the financial statements.
All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at estimated fair value.
Fair value is generally determined based on the difference between the fixed
contract price and the underlying market price at the determination date, and/or
the value confirmed by the counterparty. Changes in the fair value of effective
cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income loss,  which is later transferred to earnings when the hedged
transaction occurs. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not
designated as hedges, as well as the ineffective portion of the hedge
derivatives, are recorded in earnings. The ineffective portion is calculated as
the difference between the change in fair value of the derivative and the
estimated change in cash flows from the item hedged.
Fair value hedges. The Company monitors the debt capital markets and
interest rate trends to identify opportunities to enter into and terminate
interest rate swap contracts with the objective of reducing costs of capital. As
of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company was not a party to any open fair
value hedges.
As of December 31, 2006, the carrying value of the Company long-term debt
in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets included a $34 million
reduction in the carrying value attributable to net deferred hedge losses on
terminated fair value hedges that are being amortized as net increases to
interest expense over the original terms of the terminated agreements. The
amortization of net deferred hedge losses on terminated interest rate swaps
increased the Company reported interest expense by $14 thousand during the
year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to deferred gains amortization, which
reduced the Company reported interest expense by $41 million and $192
million during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2006, the scheduled
amortization of net deferred hedge losses on terminated interest rate hedges
including terminated fair value and cash flow hedges that will be recognized

Cash flow hedges. The Company utilizes commodity swap and collar contracts
to i reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company
produces and sells, ii support the Company annual capital budgeting and
expenditure plans and iii reduce commodity price risk associated with certain
capital projects. As of December 31, 2006, all of the Company open commodity
hedges are designated as hedges of Canadian and United States forecasted sales.
The Company also, from time to time, utilizes interest rate contracts to reduce
the effect of interest rate volatility on the Company indebtedness and forward
currency exchange agreements to reduce the effect of U.S. dollar to Canadian
dollar exchange rate volatility.
Oil prices. All material physical sales contracts governing the Company
oil production have been tied directly or indirectly to the New York Mercantile
Exchange NYMEX prices. As of December 31, 2006, all of the Company oil

Gas prices. The Company employs a policy of hedging a portion of its gas
production based on the index price upon which the gas is actually sold in order
to mitigate the basis risk between NYMEX prices and actual index prices, or
based on NYMEX prices, if NYMEX prices are highly correlated with the index
price. As of December 31, 2006, all of the Company gas hedges were designated

volumes due to delays in the start up of production in certain fields and ii
reduced correlations between the indexes of the financial hedge derivatives and
the indexes of the hedged  forecasted  production  for certain  fields.
Ineffectiveness can be associated with closed contracts i.e. realized or can
be associated with open positions i.e. unrealized. The following table sets

represented net deferred losses of $1672 and $5066 million, respectively. The
AOCI - Hedging balance as of December 31, 2006 was comprised of $710 million of
net deferred losses on the effective portions of open cash flow hedges, $1937
million of net deferred losses on terminated cash flow hedges including $17
million of net deferred losses on terminated cash flow interest rate hedges and
$975 million of associated net deferred tax benefits. The AOCI - Hedging
balance as of December 31, 2005 was comprised of $7678 million of net deferred
losses on the effective portions of open cash flow hedges, $300 million of net
deferred losses on terminated cash flow hedges including $32 million of net
deferred losses on terminated cash flow interest rate hedges and $2912 million
of associated net deferred tax benefits. The decrease in AOCI - Hedging during
the year ended  December 31, 2006 was  primarily  attributable  to the
reclassification of net deferred hedge losses to net income as derivatives
matured and, to a lesser extent, decreases in future commodity prices relative
to the commodity prices stipulated in the hedge contracts. The net deferred
losses associated with open cash flow hedges remain subject to market price
fluctuations until the positions are either settled under the terms of the hedge
contracts or terminated prior to settlement. The net deferred losses on
terminated cash flow hedges are fixed.
During the year ending December 31, 2007, based on current estimates of
future commodity prices, the Company expects to reclassify $53 million of net
deferred gains associated with open commodity hedges and $1063 million of net
deferred losses on terminated commodity hedges from AOCI - Hedging to oil and
gas revenues. The Company also expects to reclassify approximately $387 million
of net deferred income tax benefits associated with commodity hedges during the
year ending December 31, 2007 from AOCI - Hedging to income tax benefit.
Terminated  commodity hedges. At times, the Company terminates open
commodity hedge positions when the underlying commodity prices reach a point
that the Company believes will be the high or low price of the commodity prior
to the scheduled settlement of the open commodity position. This allows the
Company to maximize gains or minimize losses associated with the open hedge
positions. At the time of termination of the hedges, the amounts recorded in
AOCI - Hedging are maintained and amortized to earnings over the periods the
production was scheduled to occur.

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109. The Company and its
eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated United States federal income tax
return. Certain subsidiaries are not eligible to be included in the consolidated
United States federal income tax return and separate provisions for income taxes
have been determined for these entities or groups of entities. The tax returns
and the amount of taxable income or loss are subject to examination by United
States federal, state, local and foreign taxing authorities. Current and
estimated tax payments of $1532 million, $414 million and $192 million were
made during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
SFAS 109 requires that the Company continually assess both positive and
negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred
tax assets can be realized prior to their expiration. Pioneer monitors
Company-specific, oil and gas industry and worldwide economic factors and
assesses the likelihood that the Company net operating loss carryforwards
NOLs and other deferred tax attributes in the United States, state, local
and foreign tax jurisdictions will be utilized prior to their expiration. As of
December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company valuation allowances related to
foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions were $947 million and $958 million,
respectively.
The Company effective tax rate on continuing operations of 442 percent
and 445 percent for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively,
differs from the combined United States federal and state statutory rate of
approximately 365 percent primarily due to  o foreign tax rates,
o adjustments to the deferred tax liability for changes in enacted tax laws
and rates, as discussed below,
o statutes in foreign jurisdictions that differ from those in the United
States                    98             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004  o recognition of $84 million of deferred tax benefit, during 2006, as a
result of conversion of senior convertible notes prior to the Company
repayment of the debt principal see Note F,
o recognition of $72 million of taxes during 2005 associated with the
repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004 AJCA and
o expenses for unsuccessful well costs and associated acreage costs in
foreign locations where the Company does not expect to receive income tax
benefits.
During May 2006, the State of Texas enacted legislation that changed the
existing Texas franchise tax from a tax based on net income or taxable capital
to an income tax based on a defined calculation of gross margin the Texas
margin tax. Also, during 2006, the Canadian federal and provincial governments
enacted tax rate reductions that will be phased in over several years. SFAS 109
requires that deferred tax balances be adjusted to reflect tax rate changes
during the periods in which the tax rate changes are enacted. The adjustment due
to the enactment of the Texas margin tax and the Canadian tax rate changes
resulted in a $135 million United States tax expense and a $102 million
Canadian tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2006, respectively.
In October 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA includes a
deduction of 85 percent of qualified foreign earnings that are repatriated, as
defined in the AJCA. During 2005, the Company  determined that it was
advantageous to apply the provisions of the AJCA to qualified foreign earnings
that could be repatriated. The Company formalized repatriation plans in 2005 and
repatriated $3225 million from Canada, South Africa and Tunisia. Approximately
$177 million of the repatriated funds qualified for the dividend exclusion. The
Company is obligated by the provisions of the AJCA to invest the qualifying
dividends in the United States within a reasonable period of time.
Included in the Company income tax provision from continuing operations
for the year ended December 31, 2005 is the reversal of a $269 million tax
benefit recorded in 2004 as a result of the cancellation of the development of
the Olowi block and the Company decision to exit Gabon. Reversal of the tax
benefit was the result of signing an agreement in June 2005 to sell the
Company shares in the subsidiary that owns the interest in the Olowi block to
an unaffiliated buyer, which made it more likely than not that the Company would
not realize the originally recorded tax benefit. The Company completed the sale
of the Gabonese subsidiary during 2005.
The Company income tax provision benefit and amounts separately
allocated were attributable to the following items for the years ended December
31, 2006, 2005 and 2004                                  Year Ended December 31,

NOTE Q.   Income Per Share From Continuing Operations
Basic income per share from continuing operations is computed by dividing
income from continuing operations by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. The computation of diluted income per share
from continuing operations reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities or other contracts to issue common stock that are dilutive to income
from continuing operations were exercised or converted into common stock or
resulted in the issuance of common stock that would then share in the earnings
of the Company.
The following table is a reconciliation of the basic income from continuing
operations to diluted income from continuing operations for the years ended

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 b Common stock options to purchase 30,712 shares of common stock were
outstanding but not included in the computations of diluted income per
share from continuing operations for 2004 because the exercise prices of
the options were greater than the average market price of the common shares
and would be anti-dilutive to the computation.

NOTE S.   Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties
During October 2004, the Company concluded that a $397 million charge for
impairment was required under SFAS 144 for its Gabonese Olowi field as
development of the discovery was canceled. Due to significant increases in
projected field development costs, primarily due to increases in steel costs,
the project did not offer competitive returns. The Olowi field was the Company
only Gabonese investment. During 2005, the Company recorded an incremental
impairment charge of $644 thousand to eliminate the carrying value of the
Company Gabonese Olowi field.
NOTE T.   Volumetric Production Payments
During 2005, the Company sold 278 MMBOE of proved reserves by means of
three VPP agreements for net proceeds of $8926 million, including the
assignment of the Company  obligations under certain  derivative hedge
105             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 agreements. Proceeds from the VPPs were initially used to reduce outstanding
indebtedness. The first VPP sold 58 Bcf of gas volumes over an expected
five-year term that began in February 2005. The second VPP sold 108 million
barrels of oil MMBbls of oil volumes over an expected seven-year term that
began in January 2006. The third VPP sold 60 Bcf of gas volumes over an
expected 32-month term that began in May 2005 and 62 MMBbls of oil volumes over
an expected five-year term that began in January 2006.
The Company VPPs represent limited-term overriding royalty interests in
oil and gas reserves which: i entitle the purchaser to receive production
volumes over a period of time from specific lease interests; ii are free and
clear of all associated future production costs and capital expenditures; iii
are nonrecourse to the Company i.e., the purchaser only recourse is to the
assets acquired; iv transfer title to the purchaser; and v allow the
Company to retain the assets after the VPPs volumetric quantities have been
delivered.
Under SFAS No. 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas
Producing Companies, a VPP is considered a sale of proved reserves. As a
result, the Company i removed the proved reserves associated with the VPPs;
ii recognized the VPP proceeds as deferred revenue which are being amortized
on a unit-of-production basis to oil and gas revenues over the terms of the
VPPs; iii retained responsibility for 100 percent of the production costs and
capital costs related to VPP interests; and iv no longer recognizes production
associated with the VPP volumes.

NOTE U.   Insurance Claims
Hurricane Ivan. During September 2004, the Company sustained damages as a
result of Hurricane Ivan at its Devils Tower and Canyon Express platform
facilities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The damages delayed scheduled well
completions and interrupted production during the second half of 2004 and during
the first half of 2005. The Company maintains business interruption insurance
coverage for such circumstances. During 2004 and 2005, the Company filed claims
with its insurance providers for its estimated losses associated with Hurricane
Ivan.
Based on a settlement agreement between the Company and the insurance
providers, the Company recoverable business interruption loss related to
Hurricane Ivan was $670 million. The Company recorded $76 million and $594
million of the claims in 2004 and 2005, respectively,  in income from
discontinued  operations in the accompanying  Consolidated  Statements of
Operations.
106             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004   Fain Plant. During May 2005, the Company sustained damages as a result of a
fire at its Fain gas plant in the West Panhandle field. The damages interrupted
production from mid-May through mid-July of 2005. The Company maintained
business  interruption and physical damage  insurance  coverage for such
circumstances. The Company recognized a total of $179 million in business
interruption  recoveries and $44 million in physical damage  recoveries
associated with the Fain gas plant fire. The Company recognized $142 million of
the business interruption recoveries in 2005 and the remaining $37 million in
2006, which is included in other income in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Operations.
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. During August and September 2005, the Company
sustained damages as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita at various
facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Other than the East Cameron facility discussed
further below, the damages to the facilities were covered by physical damage
insurance.
The Company filed a business interruption claim with its insurance provider
related to its Devils Tower field resulting from its inability to sell
production as a result of damages to third-party facilities. During 2006, the
Company settled its business interruption claim with its insurance provider for
$185 million, which is included in income from discontinued operations in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
As a result of Hurricane Rita, the Company East Cameron facility, located
in the Gulf of Mexico shelf, was destroyed and the Company does not plan to
rebuild the facility based on the economics of the field. During the fourth
quarter of 2006, the Company application to reef in-place a substantial
portion of the East Cameron debris was denied. As a result, the Company
currently estimates that it will cost approximately $119 million to reclaim and
abandon the East Cameron facility. The estimate to reclaim and abandon the East
Cameron facility is based upon an analysis and fee proposal prepared by a
third-party engineering firm for the majority of the work and an estimate by the
Company for the remainder. During 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded additional
abandonment obligation charges of $750 million and $398 million, respectively,
which amounts are included in hurricane activity, net in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Operations. The operations to reclaim and abandon the
East Cameron facilities began in January 2007 and the Company expects to incur a
substantial portion of the costs in 2007.
The $119 million estimate to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron
facilities contains a number of assumptions that could cause the ultimate cost
to be higher or lower as there are many uncertainties when working offshore and
underwater with damaged equipment and wellbores. The Company currently believes
costs could range from $119 million to $175 million; however, at this point no
better estimate than any other amount within the range can be determined, thus
the Company has recorded the estimated provision of $119 million.
The Company has filed a claim with its insurance providers regarding the
loss at East Cameron. Under the Company insurance policies, the East Cameron
facility had the following coverages: a $14 million of scheduled property
value for the platform, b $4 million of scheduled business interruption
insurance after a deductible  waiting period, c $100 million of well
restoration and safety, in total, for all assets per occurrence and d $400
million for debris removal coverage for all assets per occurrence.
In December 2005, the Company received the $14 million of scheduled
property value for the East Cameron assets and recognized a gain of $97 million
associated  therewith.  The Company received the $4 million of business
interruption recoveries in 2006, which is reflected in interest and other income
in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the fourth
quarter of 2006, the Company recorded estimated insurance recoveries of $43
million, which is reflected in other current assets in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheet and in hurricane activity, net in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Operations, related to the estimated costs for the
debris removal portion of the claim as the Company believes that it is probable
that it will be successful in asserting coverage under the debris removal part
of its insurance coverage. At the present, no recoveries have been reflected
related to the well restoration and safety coverages as the Company is working
to resolve coverage issues regarding coverage under this section of the
insurance policies. Overall, the Company ultimately expects a substantial
portion of the loss to be covered by insurance.

Results of Operations
Information about the Company results of operations for oil and gas
producing activities by geographic operating segment is presented in Note R of
the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Reserve Quantity Information
The estimates of the Company proved oil and gas reserves as of December
31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, which are located in the United States, Argentina,
Canada, South Africa and Tunisia, were based on evaluations prepared by the
Company engineers and audited by independent petroleum engineers with respect
to the Company major properties and prepared by the Company engineers with
respect to all other properties. Reserves were estimated in accordance with
guidelines established by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
and the FASB, which require that reserve estimates be prepared under existing
economic and operating conditions with no provision for price and cost
escalations except by contractual arrangements. The Company reports all reserves
held under production sharing arrangements and concessions utilizing the
economic interest method, which excludes the host country share of proved
reserves. Estimated quantities for production sharing arrangements reported
under the economic interest method are subject to fluctuations in the prices
of oil and gas and recoverable operating expenses and capital costs. If costs
remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change
inversely to changes in commodity prices. The reserve estimates as of December
31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 utilized respective oil prices of $6054, $5962 and
$4196 per Bbl reflecting adjustments for oil quality, respective NGL prices
of $2982, $3634 and $2912 per Bbl, and respective gas prices of $513, $636
and $476 per Mcf reflecting adjustments for Btu content, gas processing and
shrinkage.
Oil and gas  reserve  quantity  estimates  are subject to numerous
uncertainties inherent in the estimation of quantities of proved reserves and in
the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development
expenditures. The accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of
available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment.
Results of subsequent drilling, testing and production may cause either upward
or downward revision of previous estimates. Further, the volumes considered to
be commercially recoverable fluctuate with changes in prices and operating
costs. The Company emphasizes that proved reserve estimates are inherently
imprecise and that estimates of new discoveries are more imprecise than those of
currently producing oil and gas properties. Accordingly, these estimates are
expected to change as additional information becomes available in the future.
The following table provides a rollforward of total proved reserves by
geographic area and in total for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
2004, as well as proved developed reserves by geographic area and in total as of
the beginning and end of each respective year. Oil and NGL volumes are expressed
in MBbls, gas volumes are expressed in MMcf and total volumes are expressed in
thousands of barrels of oil equivalent MBOE.                    110             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is computed by
applying year-end prices of oil and gas with consideration of price changes
only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements to the estimated future
production of proved oil and gas reserves less estimated future expenditures
based on year-end costs to be incurred in developing and producing the proved
reserves, discounted using a rate of ten percent per year to reflect the
estimated timing of the future cash flows. Future income taxes are calculated by
comparing undiscounted future cash flows to the tax basis of oil and gas
properties plus available carryforwards and credits and applying the current tax
rates to the difference. The discounted future cash flow estimates do not
include the effects of the Company commodity hedging contracts. Utilizing
December 31, 2006 commodity prices held constant over each hedge contract
term, the net present value of the Company hedge obligations, less associated
estimated income taxes and discounted at ten percent, was a liability of
approximately $82 million at December 31, 2006.
Discounted future cash flow estimates like those shown below are not
intended to represent estimates of the fair value of oil and gas properties.
Estimates of fair value should also consider probable reserves, anticipated
future oil and gas prices, interest rates, changes in development and production
costs and risks associated with future production. Because of these and other
considerations, any estimate of fair value is necessarily subjective and
imprecise.                    112             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

financial officer, have evaluated, as required by Rule 13a-15b under the

required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There have been no
changes in the Company internal control over financial reporting as defined
in Rule 13a-15f under the Exchange Act that occurred during the Company
last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to
materially affect the Company internal control over financial reporting.
MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The management of the Company is responsible for  establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the
supervision of the Company Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of the Company financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
As of December 31, 2006, management assessed the effectiveness of the
Company internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal
Control -- Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the assessment, management
determined that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on those criteria.
Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that
audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on management
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006. The report, which expresses unqualified
opinions on management assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is included
in this Item under the heading Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.                    115           REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Pioneer Natural Resources Company   We have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Pioneer
Natural Resources Company and subsidiaries the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
criteria established in Internal Control -- Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO
criteria. The Company management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing  such other  procedures  as we  considered  necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, management assessment that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the
COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance
sheets as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders' equity, cash flows and comprehensive income for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 of the Company and
our report dated February 19, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
