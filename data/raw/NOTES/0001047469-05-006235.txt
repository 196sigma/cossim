Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   
To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Yahoo!Inc.: 
We
have completed an integrated audit of Yahoo!Inc. 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004 and audits of
its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented
below. Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule 
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Yahoo!Inc. and its subsidiaries at
December31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects,
the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. As
discussed in Note4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, effective January1, 2002, the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. 
As
discussed in Note2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, during 2004, the Company adopted EITF Issue No04-08 The Effect of Contingently Convertible
Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share. 
Internal control over financial reporting 
Also,
in our opinion, management assessment, included in Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Company management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was 
49  maintained
in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management
assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s/

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsYAHOO! INC.  
Note1 THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The Company.Yahoo!Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, Yahoo! or the Company is a leading global Internet brand
and one of the most trafficked Internet destinations worldwide. Yahoo! seeks to provide Internet services that are essential and relevant to users and businesses through the provision of online
properties the Yahoo! Network to Internet users and a range of tools and marketing solutions for businesses to market to that community of users. 
Stock Split.On April7, 2004, the Yahoo! Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of the Company
shares of common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend. As a result of the stock split, Yahoo! stockholders received one additional share of Yahoo! common stock for each share of common stock
held of record on April26, 2004. The additional shares of Yahoo! common stock were distributed on May11, 2004. All share and per share amounts in these consolidated financial
statements and related notes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split for all periods presented. 
Basis of Presentation.The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Yahoo! and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Investments in entities in which the Company can exercise significant influence, but are less than majority owned and not
otherwise controlled by the Company, are accounted for under the equity method and are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company has included the results of operations
of acquired companies from the date of acquisition. 
Certain
prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Effective this year, a new subtotal is being presented in the consolidated statement of operations:
Income before income taxes, earnings in equity interests, minority interests and cumulative effect of accounting change. Earnings in equity interests and minority interests in operations of
consolidated subsidiaries are now presented below the provision for income taxes. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, these items have consistently been presented net of
income taxes. This presentation has also been adopted for prior periods. In addition, the Company has made reclassifications in the consolidated balance sheets related to the classification of auction
rate securities. Certain of these securities were included in the cash and cash equivalents line on the balance sheet in prior years. These amounts have been reclassified to short term marketable debt
securities. See Note7 Investments for additional information. 
The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its
estimates, including those related to uncollectible receivables, the useful lives of long-lived assets including property and equipment, investment fair values, goodwill and other
intangible assets, income taxes and contingencies. In addition, the Company uses assumptions when employing the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted
for pro forma disclosure purposes. The Company bases its estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances, when these carrying values are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Revenue Recognition.The Company revenues are derived principally from services, which comprise marketing services for businesses and
offerings to users. The Company classifies these revenues as marketing services and fees. The
Company recognizes revenue on arrangements in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No104 Revenue Recognition, SAB 104 and Financial
Accounting Standard Board Emerging 
56  Issues
Task Force EITF Issue No00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. In all cases, revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable,
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed, and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. In accordance with EITF No01-9,
Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor Product, the Company accounts for cash consideration given to customers, who do not receive a separately
identifiable benefit or can not reasonably estimate fair value, as a reduction of revenue rather than as an expense. 
Marketing
Services revenue is generated from several offerings including: the display of textual, rich media and graphical advertisements, display of text based links to advertiser listings, listing
based services, and commerce based transactions. 
The
Company recognizes revenue related to the display of advertisements on the Yahoo! Network as impressions are delivered. Impressions are the number of times that an advertisement appears in
pages viewed by users. Arrangements for these services generally have terms of up to three years, and in the majority of cases, the terms are less than one year or may be terminated at any time by the
advertiser. Some of these advertising agreements involve multiple element arrangements arrangements with more than one deliverable that may include placement on specific properties, and content
integration. 
The
Company generates revenue from the display of text based links to the websites of its advertisers which are placed on the Yahoo! Network as well as on the websites of third party entities which
the Company refers to as affiliates who have integrated the Company sponsored search offerings into their websites. The Company recognizes revenue from these arrangements as click-throughs
occur. Click-throughs are defined as the number of times a user clicks on an advertiser listing. The Company pays affiliates based on click-throughs on the advertiser listings that are displayed
on the websites of these affiliates. These payments are called traffic acquisition costs. In accordance with EITF Issue No99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net
as an Agent, the revenue derived from these arrangements that involve traffic supplied by affiliates is reported gross of the payment to affiliates. This revenue is reported gross due to the fact
that the Company is the primary obligor to the advertisers who are the customers of the advertising service. Listing
revenue is generated from a variety of consumer and business listings-based services, including access to the HotJobs database and classifieds such as Yahoo! Autos, Yahoo! Real Estate and
other search services. The Company recognizes listings revenue when the services are performed. 
Transaction
revenue is generated from facilitating commerce-based transactions through the Yahoo! Network, principally from Yahoo! commerce properties including Yahoo! Travel and Yahoo! Shopping.
The Company recognizes transaction
revenue when there is evidence that qualifying transactions have occurred, for example, when travel arrangements are booked through Yahoo! Travel. Fees
revenue consists of revenues generated from a variety of consumer and business fee-based services, including internet broadband and dial-up services, premium mail, music
and personals offerings as well as services for small businesses. The Company recognizes fees revenue when the services are performed. 
Short-term
deferred revenue primarily comprises contractual billings in excess of recognized revenue and payments received in advance of revenue recognition. Long-term deferred
revenue arose on the settlement of a litigation dispute. See Note14 Litigation Settlement for additional information. 
Traffic Acquisition Costs.Traffic acquisition costs consist of payments made to affiliates that have integrated the Company sponsored
search offerings into their websites and payments made to companies that direct consumer and business traffic to the Yahoo! website. The Company enters into agreements of varying duration that involve
these traffic acquisition costs. There are generally three economic structures of the affiliate agreements: fixed payments based on a guaranteed minimum amount of traffic delivered, which often carry
reciprocal performance guarantees from the affiliate; variable 
57  payments
based on a percentage of the Company revenue or based on a certain metric, such as number of searches or paid clicks; or a combination of the two. The Company expenses, as cost of revenues,
traffic acquisition costs associated with affiliate arrangements under two methods. Agreements with fixed payments are expensed ratably over the term the fixed payment covers. Agreements based on a
percentage of revenue, number of paid introductions, number of searches, or other metrics are expensed based on the volume of the underlying activity or revenue multiplied by the
agreed-upon price or rate. 
Internal Use Software and Website Development Costs.The Company has capitalized certain internal use software and Website development costs
totaling approximately $11million, $11million, and $19million during 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. The estimated useful life of costs capitalized is evaluated for each
specific project and ranges from one to three years. During 2002, 2003 and 2004, the amortization of capitalized costs totaled approximately $9million, $9million and
$11million, respectively. Capitalized internal use software and Website development costs are included in property and equipment, net. 
Product Development.Product development costs consist primarily of payroll and related expenses incurred for enhancements to and
maintenance of the Company network, classification and organization of listings within Yahoo! properties, research and development expenses, amortization of capitalized Website development costs,
and other operating costs. 
Advertising Costs.Advertising production costs are recorded as expense the first time an advertisement appears. Costs of communicating
advertising are recorded as expense as advertising space or airtime is used. All other advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense totaled approximately $94million 115million, and $160million for 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. 
Stock-Based Compensation.The Company measures compensation expense for its stock-based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic
value method. If the fair value based method had been applied in measuring stock compensation expense, the pro forma effect on net income and net income per share would have been as follows in
thousands, except per share amounts: Years Ended December31 2002

See
Recent Accounting Pronouncements below regarding the impact of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No123R SFAS123R, Share-Based Payment. 
58  Income Taxes.Deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and
liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. The provision for income taxes comprises the Company current tax liability and change in deferred income tax assets and
liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that, based on available evidence, is more likely than not to be realized. 
Comprehensive Income.Comprehensive income as defined includes all changes in equity net assets during a period from non-owner
sources. Items of comprehensive income for the Company are unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, net of tax, and foreign currency translation
adjustments which are added to net income to compute comprehensive income. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents, Short and Long-Term Investments.The Company invests its excess cash in debt instruments of the U.S.
Government and its agencies, and in high-quality corporate issuers which are classified as marketable debt securities. All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less are considered cash equivalents. Investments with effective maturities of less than twelve months from the balance sheet date
are considered short-term investments. Investments with effective maturities greater than twelve months from the balance sheet date are considered long-term investments. The
Company marketable debt and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded
in accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains or losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary, if any, on available-for-sale securities are
reported in other income, net. The Company evaluates the investments periodically for possible impairment and reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below
cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Company ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value.
The Company records impairment charges equal to the amount that the carrying value of its available-for-sale securities exceeds the estimated fair market value of the
securities as of the evaluation date, if appropriate. The fair value for securities is determined based on quoted market prices as of the valuation date. In computing realized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities, the Company determines cost based on amounts paid, including direct costs such as commissions, to acquire the security using the specific
identification method. 
The
Company has investments in equity instruments of privately-held companies. These investments are included in other long-term assets and are generally accounted for under
the cost method, as the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operations. The Company monitors its investments for impairment by considering current factors
including economic environment, market conditions and operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment, and records reductions in carrying values
when necessary. The fair value for privately held securities is estimated using the best available information as of the valuation date, including the quoted market prices of comparable public
companies, recent financing rounds of the investee and other investee specific information, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No18, The Equity Method of Accounting for
Investments in Common Stock. 
The
Company accounts for derivatives under SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No133 establishes methods of accounting for derivative
financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities. The derivatives held by the Company as of December31, 2004 comprise warrants to
purchase equity instruments in public and private companies at specified prices over original terms varying from 4 to 10years. These warrants are held for business and strategic purposes.
During the year ended December31, 2004, the Company entered into a derivative contract to sell certain securities. As of December31, 2004, the contract was completed. During 2002, 2003
and 2004, the realized and unrealized gains on derivatives recorded in other income, net were not material to the consolidated results of operations. 
59  Concentration of Risk.Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk consist
primarily of cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, and accounts receivable. As of December31, 2004, substantially all of the Company cash, cash equivalents, and investments
were managed by four financial institutions. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers. The Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses. The Company makes judgment as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables based primarily on
management evaluation of the customer financial condition, past collection history and overall aging of the receivables. Historically, such losses have been within management expectations. As of
December31, 2003 and 2004, no one customer accounted for 10percent or more of the accounts receivable balance. The fair value of marketable equity securities held by the Company was
approximately $816million as of December31, 2004. The fair value of these investments is subject to fluctuation based on market prices. 
Long-Lived Assets.
Property and Equipment.Buildings are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of 25years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term and five years. Computers and equipment, and furniture and fixtures are stated at
cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally two to five years. The Company recognized depreciation expense on property and
equipment of approximately $88million, $105million, and $165million for 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. 
Goodwill.Goodwill is carried at cost. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual test for impairment at
the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment and between annual tests in certain circumstances. The performance of the test involves a two-step
process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the Company reporting units with the reporting unit carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company generally
determines the fair value of its reporting units using the expected present value of future cash flows, giving consideration to the market valuation approach. If the carrying amount of the Company
reporting units exceeds the reporting unit fair value, the Company performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step of the
goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the Company reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. 
Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill.Intangible assets other than goodwill are carried at cost less accumulated
amortization. Intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the economic lives of the respective assets, generally two to seven years. Long-lived
assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not
be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any
impairment loss for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of
the asset. 
Foreign Currency.The functional currency of the Company international subsidiaries is generally the local currency. The financial
statements of these subsidiaries are translated to United States dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the year for
revenues and expenses. Translation gains losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders' equity. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange
transactions are included in other income, net and were not significant during the periods presented. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In March2004, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No03-01, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
Application to Certain Investments EITF03-01. EITF 03-01 provides guidance on the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to certain marketable debt and equity
securities accounted for 
60  under
SFAS No115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities and non-marketable securities accounted for under the cost method. The EITF developed a basic
three-step model to evaluate whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. In September2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03-01-1, which delays the effective date until additional guidance is issued for the application of the recognition and measurement provisions
of EITF 03-01 to investments in securities that are impaired. However, the disclosure requirements are effective for annual periods ended after June15, 2004. The Company is
currently evaluating the effect of this proposed statement on its financial position and results of operations. 
In
December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payment, which requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations all share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, based on their fair values. Accounting for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method supplemented by pro forma disclosures will no
longer be permissible. The new statement will be effective for public entities in periods beginning after June15, 2005. The Company has not yet completed its analysis of the impact of adopting
SFAS123R and is therefore currently unable to quantify the effect on its financial statements. However, the adoption of this new statement will have a significant impact on the results of
operations and net income per share of the Company as the Company will be required to expense the fair value of all share based payments. 
Note2 BASIC AND DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE 
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the
weighted average number of common and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise
of stock options using the treasury stock method and the conversion of the Company zero coupon senior convertible notes the Notes using the if-converted method. For 2002, 2003
and 2004, approximately 157million, 87million and 50million options to purchase common stock, respectively, were excluded from the calculation, as the exercise prices were
greater than the average market price of the common stock during the year. See Note9 Long-Term Debt for additional information related to the Notes. 
The
Company also accounts for the earnings per share impact of its Notes in accordance with EITF Issue No04-08, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings
per Share EITF04-08. EITF04-08 requires that contingently convertible debt be accounted for as convertible debt and included in diluted earnings per share
computations regardless of whether the market price trigger or other contingent feature has been met. The consensus was effective retroactively beginning with reporting periods ending after
December15, 2004. The Company issued its Notes in April2003 and the number of diluted shares in the year ended December31, 2003 has been revised to include the shares related
to the issuance of the Notes. The inclusion of these shares resulted in a decrease of $001 to previously reported diluted earnings per share for the year ended December31, 2003.

Acquisition completed in 2002 
HotJobs.In February2002, the Company completed the acquisition of HotJobs.com,Ltd., HotJobs, a
recruiting solutions company, which became part of its search and marketplace offerings and generates revenue primarily through listings and subscription fees for access to the HotJobs' database.
Through this acquisition, the Company gained a meaningful presence in the online segment of the recruiting marketplace. This is consistent with the Company strategy of building a diversified global
business and providing solutions for users and business partners. These factors contributed to a purchase price in excess of fair market value of the HotJobs' net tangible and intangible assets
acquired, and as a result, the Company has recorded goodwill in connection with the transaction. 
The
total purchase price of approximately $439million consisted of $192million in Yahoo! common stock, representing approximately 24million shares, $206million in cash
consideration, $34million related to approximately 7million stock options exchanged and direct transaction costs of $7million. The $206million of total cash
consideration less cash acquired of approximately $53million resulted in a net cash outlay of approximately $153million. The value of the common stock was determined based on the
average market price of Yahoo! common stock over the 5-day period surrounding the date the terms of the exchange offer were finalized in February2002. The value of the stock
options was determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. 
The
allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the fair values was as follows in thousands: Cash acquired 53,284 Other tangible assets acquired 48,359 Amortizable intangible assets Existing technology and patents 53,300 Customer contracts and related relationships 36,600 Trade name, trademark, and domain name 8,700 Goodwill 282,264 Total assets acquired 482,507 Liabilities assumed 47,343 Deferred stock-based compensation 3,928 Total 439,092 Amortizable intangible assets acquired have estimated useful lives not exceeding seven years. No amount has been allocated to in-process research
and development. Goodwill of $282million represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, and is not deductible for tax
purposes. 
Acquisitions completed in 2003 
Inktomi.On March19, 2003, the Company completed the acquisition of Inktomi Corporation Inktomi, a
provider of Web search and paid inclusion services on the Internet. The acquisition combined the Company global audience and Inktomi search technology to allow the Company to create a more
relevant, comprehensive and higher quality search offering on the Web. In February2004, the Company launched its own branded algorithmic search technology, Yahoo! Search Technology, based on
Inktomi search technology and began deployment on a worldwide basis. These factors contributed to a purchase price in excess of the fair value of the Inktomi net tangible and intangible assets
acquired, and as a result, the Company has recorded goodwill in connection with this transaction. The
total purchase price of approximately $290million consisted of $273million in cash consideration, $14million related to 2million stock options exchanged, and direct
transaction costs $3million. The $273million of total cash 
63  consideration
less cash acquired of approximately $45million resulted in a net cash outlay of $228million. The value of the stock options was determined using the Black-Scholes option
valuation model. 
The
allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values was as follows in thousands: Cash acquired 44,610 Other tangible assets acquired 27,522 Amortizable intangible assets Existing technology and patents 25,900 Customer contracts and related relationships 23,500 Goodwill 217,425 Total assets acquired 338,957 Liabilities assumed 50,638 Deferred stock-based compensation 1,287 Total 289,606 The amortizable intangible assets have useful lives not exceeding five years. No amount has been allocated to in-process research and development.
Goodwill of $217million represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, and is not deductible for tax purposes. Liabilities
assumed included approximately $23million of restructuring costs associated with the acquisition, $6million of which related to workforce reduction and the remainder related to excess
facilities. As of December31, 2004, approximately $12million remains related to excess facilities. This amount includes estimated sub-lease income based on current
comparable rates for leases in the respective markets. If facilities rental rates continue to decrease in these markets or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities, the maximum
amount the actual loss could exceed the original estimate is approximately $2million. 
Overture.On October7, 2003, the Company completed the acquisition of Overture Services,Inc.
Overture, a provider of commercial search services on the Internet, including sponsored search services. The Company believed that the combined assets would further position it as a leader in the
Internet advertising sector. Together, the two companies would be able to provide a diversified suite of integrated marketing solutions, including branding, paid placement, graphical ads,
text-links, multimedia, and contextual advertising. These factors contributed to a purchase price in excess of the fair market value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired from
Overture, and as a result, the Company has recorded goodwill in connection with this transaction. 
Under
the terms of the acquisition agreement, each outstanding share of Overture was exchanged for 12216 shares of Yahoo! common stock, representing approximately 79million shares valued at
$13billion, and $475 in cash, which amounts to $309million in aggregate cash, and together with $136million related to 19million stock options exchanged and direct
transaction costs of $10million which resulted in an aggregate purchase price of $17billion. The approximate $309million of total cash consideration less cash acquired of
$161million resulted in a net cash outlay of $148million. The value of the common stock was determined based on the average market price of the common stock over the 5-day
period surrounding the date the acquisition was announced in July2003. The value of the stock options was determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. 
64   The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values was as follows in thousands: Cash acquired 160,673 Other tangible assets acquired 237,632 Amortizable intangible assets Existing technology and patents 134,300 Affiliate and advertiser contracts and related relationships 202,300 Trade name, trademark, and domain name 17,300 Goodwill 1,155,068 Total assets acquired 1,907,273 Liabilities assumed 242,868 Deferred stock-based compensation 67,213 Total 1,731,618 The amortizable intangible assets have useful lives not exceeding five years. No amount has been allocated to in-process research and development.
Goodwill of $12billion represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, and is not deductible for tax purposes. Other
tangible assets acquired of approximately $238million included long-term prepaid traffic acquisition costs paid by Overture to Yahoo! of $30million. Liabilities assumed of
approximately $243million included a current liability for traffic acquisition costs owed by Overture to Yahoo! of $28million. Liabilities assumed included approximately
$26million of restructuring costs associated with the acquisition, $18million of which related to workforce reduction and $8million related to excess facilities. As of

Under
the terms of the acquisition, the Company has contingently agreed to pay an additional amount of cash up to a maximum of $35million per
year for two years ending December31, 2005. The total maximum of $70million in cash, part of which will be an increase to the purchase price and the remainder will be operating
expense, over the two-year period ending December31, 2005, if certain performance criteria are met. At December31, 2004, the Company recorded an additional
$20million of purchase price and $3million of additional operating expense, as 3721 achieved certain performance-based milestones. As of December31, 2004, these amounts were
included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and will be paid in 2005. 
The
allocation of the purchase price, excluding the remaining contingent payment, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values was as follows in thousands: Cash acquired 6,917 Other tangible assets acquired 4,498 Amortizable intangible assets Trade name, trademark, and domain name 1,000 Customer, affiliate, and advertiser related relationships 7,600 Developed technology and patents 3,800 Goodwill 59,397 Total assets acquired 83,212 Liabilities assumed 11,186 Deferred stock-based compensation 1,757 Total 73,783 The amortizable intangible assets have useful lives not exceeding five years.

net tangible and intangible assets acquired, and is not deductible for tax purposes. The preliminary purchase price allocation for Musicmatch is subject to revision as more detailed analysis is
completed and additional information on the fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available. Any change in the fair value of the net assets of Musicmatch will change the amount of the purchase
price allocable to goodwill. 
Other Acquisitions.During the year ended December31, 2004 the Company acquired three other companies which
were accounted for as business combinations. The total estimated purchase price for these three acquisitions was approximately $49million and consisted of $46million in cash
consideration and $2million related to stock options exchanged and $1million direct transaction costs. The total cash consideration of $46million less cash acquired of
approximately $2million resulted in a net cash outlay of $44million. Of the purchase price, approximately $41million was allocated to goodwill, $14million to
amortizable intangible assets and $6million to net assumed liabilities. No amounts have been allocated to in-process research and development. Goodwill represents the excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, and is not deductible for tax purposes. The purchase price allocations for these acquisitions are preliminary and
subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information on the fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available. Any change in the fair value of the net assets of
the acquired companies will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. 
The
results of operations of each of the acquisitions completed during the year ended December31, 2004 have been included in the Company consolidated statements of operations since the date
that the respective acquisition was completed. Proforma results of operations have not been presented for the acquisitions completed during the year as the results of the acquired companies either
individually or in aggregate were not material to the Company.

primarily includes certain purchase price adjustments that affect existing goodwill, and foreign currency translation adjustments. Foreign currency translation adjustments,
reflecting movement in the currencies of the underlying entities, totaled approximately $31million for the year ended December31, 2004, and were immaterial for the year ended
December31, 2003. See also Note3 Acquisitions for additional information.
2Reclassification
reflects the allocation of goodwill related to the Overture acquisition to the Company financial reporting segments. 
Upon adoption of SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Company performed a transitional impairment test of its goodwill and
intangible assets as of January1, 2002. Due to, among other things, the overall softening of the global economy and the related decline in international advertising, the Company recorded a
transitional goodwill impairment loss of approximately $64million in the International segment, which was recorded during the first quarter of 2002 as a cumulative effect of an accounting
change in the Company consolidated statements of operations. 
68  The
fair value of the reporting units was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows and the market valuation approach. 
The
Company performed its annual assessment of goodwill in 2003 and 2004, and concluded that there were no additional impairments.

The longer the term of the
securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in market rates of interest and yields on bonds. Investments are reviewed periodically to identify possible impairment. When evaluating the
investments, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Company ability and
intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value. The Company has the intent and ability to hold these securities for a reasonable
period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value up to or beyond the initial cost of the investment. The Company expects to realize the full value of all of these investments upon
maturity or sale.

Note14 Litigation Settlement for additional information related to the change in the balance of corporate equity securities. 
Note8 JOINT VENTURES 
SOFTBANK Corp., including its consolidated affiliates SOFTBANK was approximately a four percent stockholder of the Company at December31, 2004. The Company has
joint ventures with SOFTBANK in France, Germany, Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom to establish and manage versions of the Yahoo! Internet Guide for those countries. In March2004,
SOFTBANK and the Company entered into an agreement that provided that, so long as SOFTBANK directly or indirectly owns or controls any shares of the Company common stock, SOFTBANK shall, at the
Company direction, either vote or cause to be voted such shares of common stock in accordance with any written voting recommendation of the Company Board of Directors or grant a proxy to the
Company entitling the Company to vote or cause to be voted such shares in proportion to the votes cast by the other stockholders of the Company. 
73  Yahoo! Japan.During April1996, the Company signed a joint venture agreement with SOFTBANK, which was amended in
September1997, whereby Yahoo! Japan Corporation Yahoo! Japan was formed. The Company also has commercial arrangements with Yahoo! Japan, consisting of services, including algorithmic
search services and sponsored search services
and the related traffic acquisition costs, and license fees. Due to the acquisition of Overture, traffic acquisition costs have increased resulting in the net cost of these arrangements of
approximately $67million for the year ended December31, 2004, compared to net revenues of $8million and $9million for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2003,
respectively. As of December31, 2003 and 2004, the Company had a net payable balance to Yahoo! Japan of approximately $2million and $30million respectively. 
The
investment in Yahoo! Japan is being accounted for using the equity method. As of December31, 2004, the carrying value of the investment was approximately $240million and is
recorded in long-term other assets. The fair value of the Company 34percent ownership in Yahoo! Japan, based on the quoted trading price, was approximately $12billion as
of December31, 2004. 
Prior
to and during 2001, Yahoo! Japan acquired the Company equity interests in certain entities in Japan for total consideration of approximately $65million, paid partially in shares of
Yahoo! Japan common stock and partially in cash. As a result of the acquisition, the Company increased its investment in Yahoo! Japan, which resulted in approximately $41million of goodwill to
be amortized over seven years. The amortization ceased upon the adoption of SFAS No142. 
The
Company also records its share of the results of Yahoo! Japan one quarter in arrears within earnings in equity interests. The following table presents Yahoo! Japan condensed financial
information, as derived from the Yahoo! Japan financial statements for the years ended September30, 2002, 2003 and 2004 and as of September30, 2003 and 2004 in thousands: Years Ended September30 2002

financial statements. 
Yahoo! Europe.During November, 1996, the Company signed a joint venture agreement with a subsidiary of SOFTBANK whereby separate companies
were formed in France, Germany and the United Kingdom collectively Yahoo! Europe to establish and manage versions of the Yahoo! Internet Guide for those countries, develop related online
navigational services, and conduct other related business. The parties have invested a total of $6million in proportion to their respective equity interests as of December31, 2004. The
Company has a majority share of approximately 70percent in each of the Yahoo! Europe entities, and therefore, has consolidated their financial results. Minority interests are presented
separately on the consolidated balance sheets and statement of operations. 
Yahoo! Korea.During August1997, the Company signed a joint venture agreement with SOFTBANK and other SOFTBANK affiliated companies
whereby Yahoo! Korea was formed to develop and operate a Korean version of the 
74  Yahoo!
Internet Guide, develop related Korean online navigational services, and conduct other related business. The parties originally invested a total of $1million in proportion to their
respective equity interests. During March2000, the Company invested an additional $61million in Yahoo! Korea. As a result, the Company recorded goodwill of approximately
$20million. The Company has a majority share of approximately 67percent in the joint venture, and therefore, has consolidated its financial results. Minority interests are presented
separately on the consolidated balance sheets and statement of operations. Note9 LONG-TERM DEBT 
In April2003, the Company issued $750million of zero coupon senior convertible notes the Notes due April2008, which resulted in net proceeds to the
Company of approximately $733million after transaction fees of $17million, which have been deferred and are included on the consolidated balance sheets in other assets. As of
December31, 2004, approximately $11million of the transaction fees remain to be amortized. The Notes were issued at par and bear no interest. The Notes are convertible into Yahoo!
common stock at a conversion price of $2050 per share, which would result in the issuance of an aggregate of approximately 37million shares, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of
specified events. Each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes will initially be convertible into 4878 shares of Yahoo! common stock. The
Notes are convertible prior to the final maturity date 1during any fiscal quarter if the closing sale price of the Company common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30
trading-day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter exceeded 110percent of the conversion price on that 30th trading day,
2during the period beginning January1, 2008 through the maturity date, if the closing sale price of the Company common stock on the previous trading day was 110percent or
more of the then current conversion price, and 3upon specified corporate transactions. Upon conversion, the Company has the right to deliver cash in lieu of common stock. The Company may be
required to repurchase all of the Notes following a fundamental change of the Company, such as a change of control, prior to maturity at face value. The Company may not redeem the Notes prior to their
maturity. 
As
of December31, 2004, the market price condition for convertibility of the Notes was satisfied with respect to the fiscal quarter beginning January1, 2005 and ending on
March31, 2005. During this period holders of the Notes will be able to convert their Notes into shares of Yahoo! common stock at the rate of 4878 shares of Yahoo! common stock for each Note.
The Notes will also be convertible into shares of Yahoo! common stock in subsequent fiscal quarters, if any, with respect to which the market price condition for convertibility is met. As of
December31, 2004, the fair value of the Notes was approximately $14billion based on quoted market prices. The shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes have been included in the
computation of diluted net income per share since the Notes were issued.

As of December31, 2004, the Company United States federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately
$31billion and $23billion, respectively. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2008, and approximately $360million of the
state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2005. The Company United States federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes are approximately
$94million and $98million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2010. 
The
Company has a valuation allowance of approximately $14billion as of December31, 2004 to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized
in future periods. In evaluating the Company ability to recover its deferred income tax assets the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including its operating results,
ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. The change in valuation allowance from 2003 to 2004 was primarily
related to unrealized gains during the year on available-for-sale securities. See Note14 Litigation Settlement for additional information. Approximately
$13billion of the deferred income tax asset balance at December31, 2004 pertains to certain net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards resulting from the
exercise of employee stock options. When recognized, the tax benefit of these loss and credit carryforwards are accounted for as a credit to additional paid-in capital rather than a
reduction of the income tax provision. Approximately $100million of the deferred income tax asset balance relates to net operating losses acquired in certain business combinations and will
adjust goodwill when recognized. Approximately $68million of the deferred income tax asset balance relates to foreign net operating losses that will reduce the provision for income taxes if
and when utilized. 
The
Company provides U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. As of
December31, 2004 the Company had unrecorded deferred income tax liabilities of approximately $16million related to $45million of cumulative net undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries. These earnings are considered to be indefinitely invested in operations outside the United States, as the Company intends to utilize these amounts to fund future expansion of its
international operations. 
Note11 STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY 
Stockholder Rights Plan.In March2001, the Company adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan. Under the plan, the rights were distributed as
a dividend at the rate of one Right for each share of common stock held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on March20, 2001. The Stockholder Rights Plan was not adopted in
response to any effort to acquire control of the Company. The rights will expire on March1, 2011. 
Stock Repurchase Program.In March2001, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the Company to repurchase
up to $500million of its outstanding shares of common stock from time to time over the next two years, depending on market conditions, share price and other factors. In March2003, the
Company Board of Directors authorized a two-year extension of the stock repurchase program. The Company may utilize equity instrument contracts to facilitate the repurchase of common
stock. From March2001 through December31, 2004, the Company had repurchased 32,917,240 shares of common stock at an average price of $486 per share for a total amount of approximately
$60million. Of the shares repurchased, 32,067,240 shares were purchased from SOFTBANK at an average price of $484 per share. No shares were repurchased during the year ended
December31, 2004. Treasury stock is accounted for under the cost method. 
Structured Stock Repurchases.During the year ended December31, 2004, the Company entered into two structured stock repurchase
transactions which settle in cash or stock depending on the market price of Yahoo! common stock on the date of maturity. In February2004, the Company entered into a six month structured
stock repurchase transaction in the amount of $50million which matured in August2004 resulting in the Company receiving a cash settlement of approximately $54million. In
August2004, the Company entered into a $100million transaction which will mature in 
77  four
separate tranches through March31, 2005. One of the four tranches matured and settled in December2004, resulting in the Company receiving a cash settlement of approximately
$26million. On each of the remaining maturity dates, if the market price of Yahoo! common stock is at or above the pre-determined price agreed in connection with such transaction,
which ranges from $2541 to $2674 for the remaining three tranches, the Company will have its investment returned with a premium. If the market price of the Company common stock is below the
pre-determined price, the Company will repurchase shares of its common stock, up to an aggregate of 31million shares. These transactions are recorded in stockholders' equity on
the consolidated balance sheets as of December31, 2004. The shares underlying these transactions were considered outstanding at December31, 2004 and have been included in the
computation of both basic and diluted net income per share for the year ended December31, 2004. 
Note12 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
Benefit Plan.The Company maintains a Yahoo!Inc. 401k Plan the 401k Plan for its full-time employees. The 401k
Plan allows employees of the Company to contribute up to the Internal Revenue Code prescribed maximum amount. Each participant in the 401k Plan may elect to contribute from one percent to fifty
percent of his or her annual compensation to the 401k Plan. The Company matches employee contributions at a rate of 25percent. Employee contributions are fully vested, whereas vesting in
matching Company contributions occurs at a rate of 33percent per year of employment. During 2002, 2003, and 2004, the Company contributions amounted to approximately $3million 5million, and $8million, respectively. 
Stock Option Plans.The Company 1995 Stock Plan and stock option plans assumed through acquisitions are collectively referred to as the
Plans. 
The
Plans allow for the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, and stock purchase rights. Options are generally granted for a term of ten years and generally
vest over a four-year period. The 1995 Stock Plan was amended in April2002 to increase the number of shares available for issuance under the plan by an aggregate of
70million shares to 574million shares. The 1995 Stock Plan was further amended in May2003 to enable the Company to grant additional types of equity-based awards under the 1995
Stock Plan, including
but not limited to, stock appreciation rights, indexed options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and dividend equivalents. The amendment also extended the termination date of the 1995 Stock
Plan from May2005 to May2013. Shares available for future option grants at December31, 2004 totaled approximately 39million. The
1996 Directors' Stock Option Plan the Directors' Plan provides for the issuance of up to approximately 9million non-statutory stock options to non-employee
directors of the Company. Options under the Directors' Plan vest in equal monthly installments over four years for initial grants to new directors, and over four years for annual grants, with
25percent of such options vesting on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant, with the remaining options vesting in equal monthly installments over the 36-month
period thereafter. The Directors' Plan was amended in April2002 to increase the annual grant for outside Directors from 20,000 shares to 50,000 shares and to increase the number of shares
available for issuance under the plan by an aggregate of 4million shares to approximately 9million shares. Shares available for future option grants at December31, 2004 under

to purchase approximately 134million shares and 128million shares were exercisable as of December31, 2002 and 2003, respectively. The weighted average exercise prices
per share for options exercisable as of December31, 2002, and 2003 were $2280 and $2463, respectively. 
79  Restricted Stock.The 1995 Stock Plan permits the granting of restricted stock either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other awards
made by the Company. Rights of repurchase on restricted stock grants generally lapse upon meeting certain performance-based milestones, or passage of time, or a combination of both. Restricted stock
grants are generally measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the Company common stock. Such value is recognized as an expense over
the corresponding service period. Restricted stock awards that have performance criteria are subject to variable accounting treatment. Approximately 438,000 shares and 405,000 shares of restricted
stock were issued during the years ended December31, 2003 and 2004, respectively. 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan.The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan, which provides for the issuance of a
maximum of approximately 30million shares of common stock. The Purchase Plan was amended in May2004 to increase number of shares available for issuance under the plan by an aggregate
of 15million to 30million. In February2001, the Company amended the Purchase Plan to allow, among other things, a 24-month offering period beginning with the
July1, 2001 offering period. Eligible employees can have up to 15percent of their earnings withheld, up to certain maximums, to be used to purchase shares of the Company common stock
at certain plan-defined dates. The price of the common stock purchased under the Purchase Plan for offering periods on or subsequent to July1, 2001 is equal to 85percent of
the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each 24-month offering period or the specified purchase date. 
During
2002, approximately 2million shares were purchased at prices from $463 to $628 per share. During 2003, approximately 3million shares were purchased at prices from $463 to
$1053 per share. During 2004, approximately 2million shares were purchased at prices from $1858 to $2148 per share. As of December31, 2004, approximately 18million shares
were available under the Purchase Plan for future issuance. 
Stock-Based Compensation.The Company measures compensation expense for its stock-based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic
value method. The Company recorded compensation expense in the amount of approximately $8million, $22million and $32million, in 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. The recorded
stock compensation expense relates to the amortization of the intrinsic value of Yahoo! stock options issued and assumed in connection with business combinations and other equity-based awards. This
expense is generally being amortized using the accelerated amortization
method in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No28 Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans. As of
December31, 2004, approximately $29million remains to be amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the options and restricted stock. If the fair value based method had been
applied in measuring stock compensation expense, the pro forma effect on net income and net income per share would have been as follows in thousands, except per share amounts: Years Ended December31 200212
200312
20041 Net income loss As reported 42,815 237,879 839,553 Add: Stock compensation expense included in reported net income, net of related tax effects 5,041 12,987 19,374 Less: Stock compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of related tax effects 389,045 183,515 235,728 Pro forma net income loss 341,189 67,351 623,199 Net income loss per share As reported basic 004 019 062 As reported diluted 004 018 058 Pro forma basic 029 005 046 Pro forma diluted 029 005 043 80   The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company options have characteristics significantly different from
those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in the opinion of management, the existing models do not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its options. 
Because
additional stock options are expected to be granted each year, the pro forma disclosures are not representative of pro forma effects on reported financial results for future years. The fair
value of option grants is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: Years Ended December31 2002

35 1For
the year ended December31, 2002, the Company used its three-year trailing volatility to estimate expected stock price volatility in the computation of
stock-based compensation under the fair value method. For the year ended December31, 2003, the Company used an equally weighted average of three-year trailing volatility and
market-based implied volatility for the computation. For the year ended December31, 2004, the Company used an equally weighted average of three-and-one
half-year trailing volatility and market-based implied volatility for the computation.
2For
the years ended December31, 2002 and 2003, the stock compensation expense amounts have been adjusted to reflect lower calculated fair values for employee stock options
which resulted in a decrease of $99million $008 per share in the pro forma net loss for the year ended December31, 2002 and an increase of $33million $002 per share in
the pro forma net income for the year ended December31, 2003. These adjustments were required as the Company estimate of the fair value of employee stock options was incorrectly based on a
five-and-one-half year expected life rather than the three year expected life intended by management. 
Note13 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
Operating Leases.During 1999, the Company entered into agreements for the development of an office complex in Sunnyvale, California to
serve as its headquarters. Upon substantial completion of the construction in 2001, approximately $259million was funded for the complex in connection with the lease financing arrangement, and
at December31, 2001 such amount had been classified as restricted long-term investments. During July2002, the Company exercised its right, pursuant to the master lease
agreement to acquire the complex for approximately $259million, which was funded by the restricted long-term investments. The Company has also entered into various
non-cancelable operating lease agreements for other offices throughout the United States, and for international subsidiaries, for original lease periods up to 23years and expiring
between 2005 and 2027.

81  
Other Commitments.In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers,
vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company breach of such agreements, services to be
provided by the Company, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of
its officers that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The Company
has also agreed to indemnify certain former officers, directors and employees of acquired companies in connection with the acquisition of such companies. The Company maintains director and officer
insurance, which may cover certain liabilities arising from its obligation to indemnify its directors, and officers and former directors, officers and employees of acquired companies, in certain
circumstances. 
It
is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances
involved in each particular agreement. Such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, the Company has not incurred material costs as a result of obligations
under these agreements and it has not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in its financial statements. 
On
April21, 2003, Overture completed its purchase of the Web Search unit of Fast Search and Transfer ASA, a Norway based developer of search and real-time filtering technologies,
for $70million in cash, plus a contingent earn-out payment of up to $30million over three years based on specified operating criteria. The earn-out payment is
not included in the contractual obligations table. 
On
January2, 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of 3721. In January2004, approximately $51million in cash consideration was paid. Under the terms of the
acquisition, the Company also contingently agreed to pay an additional amount up to a maximum of $70million in cash, part of which will be an
increase to the purchase price and the remainder will be operating expense, over the two-year period ending December31, 2005, if certain performance criteria are met. At
December31, 2004, the Company recorded an additional $20million of additional purchase price and $3million of additional operating expense, as 3721 achieved certain
performance-based milestones. As of December31, 2004, these amounts were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and will be paid in 2005. The remaining contingent payment
of up to $35million is not included in the contractual obligations table below. See Note3 Acquisitions for additional information related to this acquisition.

occurrence of certain events. Upon conversion, the Company has the right to deliver cash in lieu of common stock. See Note9 Long-Term Debt for additional
information related to the long-term debt.
2The
Company is obligated to make payments under contracts to provide sponsored search services to its affiliates, which represent traffic acquisition costs.
3The
Company is obligated to make payments under various arrangements with vendors and other business partners, principally for marketing, bandwidth and content arrangements. 
82  
At December31, 2003 and 2004, the Company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often
referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually
narrow or limited purposes. As such, the Company is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if the Company had engaged in such relationships. 
Contingencies.From time to time, third parties assert patent infringement claims against the Company. Currently, the Company is engaged in
several lawsuits regarding patent issues and has been notified of a number of other potential patent disputes. 
In
addition, from time to time the Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights and
other intellectual property rights, and a
variety of claims, including claims alleging defamation or invasion of privacy, arising in connection with its email, message boards, auction sites, shopping services, and other communications and
community features. 
In
October2000, 800-JR-Cigar,Inc. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Overture, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company acquired in October2003. In October2002, Robert Novak, doing business as Pets Warehouse and PetsWarehouse.com, filed a complaint in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of New York against Overture. In May2004, Government Employees Insurance Company GEICO filed a complaint in the Eastern District of Virginia against
Overture. The plaintiffs in each of these cases claim, among other things, that they have trademark rights in certain search terms and that Overture violates these rights by allowing its advertisers
to bid on these search terms. The complaints seek injunctive relief and damages. Overture settled with GEICO in November2004 and with Robert Novak and Pets Warehouse in February2005.
Overture has also been named as a defendant in several other trade name infringement actions filed in Los Angeles, California in which plaintiffs made similar claims. The Company and Overture believe
that Overture has meritorious defenses to liability and damages in each of these lawsuits and are contesting them vigorously. In August2003, Accor filed a similar complaint in the Nanterre
District Court in France against Overture and Overture S.A.R.L., Overture wholly-owned subsidiary in France. On January17, 2005, the Nanterre District Court ruled in favor of Accor and found
Overture and Overture S.A.R.L. liable for trademark infringement. Overture S.A.R.L. has appealed, and Overture intends to appeal, this decision. 
On
May24, 2001, Arista Records,Inc., Bad Boy Records, BMG Music d/b/a The RCA Records Label, Capitol Records,Inc., Virgin Records America,Inc., Sony Music
EntertainmentInc., UMG Recordings,Inc., Interscope Records, Motown Record Company, L.P., and Zomba Recording Corporation filed a lawsuit alleging copyright infringement against LAUNCH
Media,Inc. LAUNCH in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the consumer-influenced portion of LAUNCH
LAUNCHcast service is interactive within the meaning of Section114 of the Copyright Act and therefore does not qualify for the compulsory license provided for by the Copyright Act. The
Complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief and damages for the alleged infringement. After the lawsuit was commenced, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire LAUNCH. In
June2001, LAUNCH settled the LAUNCH litigation as to UMG Recordings,Inc. The Company acquisition of LAUNCH closed in August2001, and since that time LAUNCH has been a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company and LAUNCH do not believe that LAUNCH has infringed any rights of plaintiffs and intend to vigorously contest the lawsuit. In January2003, LAUNCH
settled the LAUNCH litigation as to Sony Music Entertainment,Inc. In October2003, LAUNCH settled the litigation as to Capitol Records,Inc. and Virgin Records
America,Inc. Accordingly, BMG Music d/b/a/ The RCA Records Label is the sole remaining plaintiff in this proceeding. On March16, 2004, plaintiffs filed motions for partial summary
judgment on the issues of willful infringement and whether the consumer-influenced portion of Launch LAUNCHcast service is interactive within the meaning of Section114 of the Copyright Act
and therefore does not qualify for the compulsory license provided for by the Copyright Act. LAUNCH filed its opposition to the motions for partial summary judgment on April30, 2004, and a
hearing on the motions was held on June18, 2004. The Court has not yet ruled on the motions for summary 
83  judgment.
The Company does not believe it is feasible to predict or determine the outcome or resolution of the remaining LAUNCH litigation at this time. The range of possible resolutions of such
LAUNCH litigation could include judgments against LAUNCH or settlements that could require substantial payments by LAUNCH. 
On
July12, 2001, the first of several purported securities class action lawsuits was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against certain
underwriters involved in Overture initial public offering, Overture, and certain of Overture current and former officers and directors. The Court consolidated the cases against Overture.
Plaintiffs allege, among other things, violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 involving undisclosed compensation to the underwriters, and improper practices
by the underwriters, and seek unspecified damages. Similar complaints were filed in the same court against numerous public companies that conducted initial public offerings of their common stock since
the mid-1990s. All of these lawsuits were consolidated for pretrial purposes before Judge Shira Scheindlin. On April19, 2002, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, alleging
Rule10b-5 claims of fraud. On July15, 2002, the issuers filed a motion to dismiss for failure to comply with applicable pleading standards. On October8, 2002, the
Court entered an Order of Dismissal as to all of the individual defendants in the Overture IPO litigation, without prejudice. On February19, 2003, the Court denied the motion to dismiss the
Rule10b-5 claims against certain defendants, including Overture. Settlement discussions on behalf of the named defendants have occurred over the last year, resulting in a final
settlement memorandum of understanding with the plaintiffs and Overture insurance carriers. This settlement proposal includes the settlement of and release of claims against the issuer defendants,
including Overture. The settlement is subject to a number of conditions, including approval of the court. If the settlement does not occur, and litigation against Overture continues, the Company and
Overture believe that Overture has meritorious defenses to liability and damages and intend to defend the case vigorously. 
On
or about February4, 2004, a shareholder derivative action was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, against the Company as nominal
defendant and certain of the Company current and former officers and directors the Derivative Defendants. Two similar shareholder derivative actions were filed in the California Superior Court
for the County of San Mateo on February13, 2004. The complaints generally allege breaches of fiduciary duties by the Derivative Defendants related to the alleged purchase of shares in initial
public offerings or the alleged acquiescence in such conduct. The complaints seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief purportedly on behalf of the Company from the Derivative Defendants. The
Company understands the Derivative Defendants deny any impropriety and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. The Company does not believe that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have
a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In April2004, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the Delaware action for failure to plead demand
futility. On August2, 2004, the Delaware Court of Chancery granted the motion to dismiss. On October18, 2004, the plaintiffs appealed the granting of the motion to dismiss. On
January21, 2005, the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware affirmed the opinion of the Delaware Court of Chancery granting the motion to dismiss. 
The
Company does not believe, based on current knowledge, that any of the foregoing legal proceedings or claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. However, the Company may incur substantial expenses in defending against third party claims. In the event of a determination adverse to the Company or its subsidiaries, the
Company may incur substantial monetary liability, and be required to change its business practices. Either of these could have a material adverse effect on the Company financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. 
Note14 LITIGATION SETTLEMENT 
In April2002, the Company wholly owned subsidiary, Overture, filed a lawsuit against GoogleInc. Google in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of California. The lawsuit asserted that Google infringed Overture U.S. Patent No6,269,361 the 361 patent. The 361 patent protects various features and innovations
relating to bid-for-performance products and Overture pay-for-performance sponsored search technologies. 
84  In
addition, the Company had a second dispute with Google concerning the shares issuable to the Company pursuant to a warrant held by the Company to purchase Google shares that were received in
connection with a June2000 services agreement. Pursuant to a conversion provision in the warrant, in June2003, Google issued 12million shares to the Company. The Company
believed it was entitled to a greater number of shares in accordance with the warrant agreement. 
In
August2004, Google issued 27million shares of ClassA common stock in settlement of these two disputes. The Company agreed to dismiss the 361 patent lawsuits and has granted
to Google a fully-paid license to the 361 patent as well as several related patent applications held by Overture. The Company allocated the 27million shares between the two
disputes, based on the relative fair values of the two disputes, including consideration of a valuation performed by a third party. A portion of the shares allocated to the patent dispute has been
recorded as an adjustment to goodwill for the period that the patents were in effect prior to Overture acquisition by the Company. The portion of the shares received for the settlement of the patent
dispute which has been allocated to future periods has been recorded in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets and will be recognized as fees revenues over the remaining life of the
patent, approximately 12years. The shares allocated to the warrant dispute settlement did not have an income statement effect as the fair value of the warrant was recorded at the time the
services were performed based on the fair value of the services rendered. 
During
the year ended December31, 2004, the Company disposed of approximately 40million shares of Google and recorded a gain of approximately $413million, net of selling
costs, which is included in other income, net on the consolidated statements of operations. Certain of these shares were sold through a derivative contract which allowed the Company to sell certain of
its Google shares in a transaction with a third party bank the Bank. The Google shares that were subject to the derivative contract were pledged to the Bank for the term of the option contract.
Realized gains on the derivative contract, which are included in other income, net on the consolidated statements of operations, were not material. The derivative contract expired prior to
December31, 2004 and no shares were pledged as of that date. The capital gain on these transactions, together with the increased fair value of marketable equity securities held by the Company,
resulted in the recognition of a tax benefit related to previously reserved capital losses, which reduced the effective income tax rate for the year ended December31, 2004 when compared to the
year ended December31, 2003. 
The
Company remaining holdings of approximately 42million Google shares are now classified as available-for-sale securities and reported at fair value and included
in marketable equity securities on the consolidated balance sheets in the amount of approximately $812million. The unrealized gain, net of tax, of $482million as of December31,
2004 is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. The related tax effect has been recorded as a deferred income tax liability. 
Note15 SEGMENTS 
The Company manages its business geographically. The primary areas of measurement and decision-making are the United States and International. Management relies on an internal
management reporting process that provides revenue and segment operating income before depreciation and amortization for making financial decisions and allocating resources. Segment operating income
before depreciation and amortization includes income from operations before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of stock compensation expense. Management believes that
segment operating income before depreciation and amortization is an appropriate measure of evaluating the operational performance of the Company segments. However, this measure should be considered
in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, income from operations or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Note16 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
The Company and other third parties are limited partners in Softbank Capital Partners LP Softbank Capital, a venture capital fund which is an affiliate of SOFTBANK. A
Managing Partner of Softbank Capital is also a member of the Company Board of Directors. The total investment by the Company in Softbank Capital is approximately $36million and represents
less than a 5% holding in Softbank Capital. A significant portion of this investment has been impaired by the Company, with the remaining value included on the consolidated balance sheets in other
assets. Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the Company invested on the same terms and on the same basis as all other limited partners. 
Revenue
from related parties, excluding Yahoo! Japan, represented less than one percent of our total revenue in the years ended December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004. Management believes that prices
on agreements with related parties were comparable to those with other similarly situated customers of the Company. 
See
Note8 Joint Ventures for additional information related to transactions involving Yahoo! Japan. 
Note17 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
Stock Repurchase Program.In February and March2005, the Company repurchased 4,907,230 shares of common stock in open market
transactions at an average price of approximately $3360 per share, for a total amount of approximately $165million.

26 PART II Item 5. Controls and Procedures     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
The Company management, with the participation of the Company Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company
disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act
as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Company Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the
Company disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act. 
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
There have not been any changes in the Company internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules13a-15f and
15d-15f under the Exchange Act during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company internal control over
financial reporting. 
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
The Company management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15f and
15d-15f under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, the Company management concluded
that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2004. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
The
Company independent registered public accounting firm has audited management assessment of the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004 as stated in their report which appears on page 49.
