33              INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
TALX Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TALX Corporation
and subsidiaries as of March 31, 1997 and 1998, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended March 31, 1998. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TALX Corporation and
subsidiaries as of March 31, 1997 and 1998, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March
31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                            KPMG PEAT MARWICK LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MARCH 31, 1998 AND 1997 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a Description of Business
TALX Corporation TALX or the Company provides interactive Web, interactive
voice response IVR, computer telephony CTI software and services to large
organizations such as Fortune 500 companies and federal government agencies. The
Company software and services enable an organization employees, customers,
vendors and business partners Users to access, input and update information
without human assistance. The Company software and services enhance service
levels, improve productivity and reduce costs by enabling Users to perform
self-service transactions. Historically, the Company has designed and
implemented tailored systems that provide an organization Users with access
to databases of information relating to that organization.
The Work Number for EveryoneR The Work NumberR is a national service
providing automated access to information from multiple organizations. The Work
Number provides automated responses to requests by mortgage lenders or other
verifiers for confirmation of employment information about a participating
employer current and former employees.
Tailored software and services are offered by TALX to its customers either
installed on customers' premises or on an outsourced services basis. The Company
has provided tailored software and services installed at customers' premises
since the early 1980s. In 1993, the Company introduced its outsourced services
business which allows a client to realize the benefits of the Company software
without incurring the administrative or maintenance responsibilities of
operating such a system. For outsourced services customers, the Company
maintains the client database on a system at the Company facilities, where
incoming requests for access to the information are received.
In addition to providing software and services described above, the Company has
historically provided database and document services. Database services include
providing sales leads and prepress services for directory publishers. Document
services include the preparation and mailing of invoices, statements, and
confirmation letters for organizations with high-volume requirements. See Note 2
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
b Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TALX Corporation
and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.
c Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.
d Short-term Investments
Short-term investments at March 31, 1997 consisted of U.S. government agency
debt instruments. The Company classifies its debt and marketable equity
securities in one of two categories: available-for-sale or held-to maturity.
Held-to-maturity securities are those securities which the Company has the
ability and intent to hold until maturity. All other securities are classified
as available-for-sale. All of the Company
37
39 securities were classified as held-to-maturity at March 31, 1997. Interest
income is recognized when earned. Debt securities classified as held-to-maturity
are stated at amortized cost. The estimated fair value of the short-term
investments was approximately the cost basis at March 31, 1997. There were no
short-term investments at March 31, 1998.
e Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or market.
Inventories consist primarily of hardware and spare parts.
f Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation is computed using straight-line and accelerated
methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Amortization of leasehold
improvements and assets recorded under capital leases is computed using the
straight-line method over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or lease
term.
g Product Development and Capitalized Software Development Costs
Product development costs are charged to operations as incurred. Software
development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is
achieved, after which they are capitalized on a product-by-product basis.
Amortization of capitalized software development costs is the greater of the
amount computed using i the ratio that current gross revenues for a product
bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that
product or ii the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic
life of the product. Amortization of capitalized software development costs
starts when the product is available for general release to customers.
h Revenue Recognition, Work in Progress, and Progress Billings
Revenues from The Work Number are recognized from fees charged to Users for
verifications of employment history and salary and from employer conversion and
maintenance fees. Customer premises systems revenue is generally recognized upon
shipment of the system. The Company sells some customer premises systems through
certain strategic alliance relationships. In these instances, revenues are
recognized at the time of shipment to the strategic alliance customer;
however, the Company does not have any future obligations related to these types
of sales. Outsourced services revenue is recognized as the services are
provided. Revenue from maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably
over the maintenance period. Deferred maintenance revenue represents the
unearned portion of maintenance fees.
i Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company sells its sofware and services in a variety of industries. One
customer represented approximately 12% and 14%, of revenues in fiscal 1997 and
1996, respectively. No customer represented over 10% of revenues in fiscal 1998.
The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers' financial
condition and generally does not require collateral; however, it maintains a
security interest in hardware until payment is received. Credit losses from
customers have been within management expectations, and management believes
the allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides for any expected losses.
j Income Taxes
The Company records income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to
38
40 apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date.
k Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company discloses estimated fair values for its financial instruments. A
financial instrument is defined as cash or a contract that both imposes on one
entity a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial instrument
to a second entity and conveys to that second entity a contractual right to
receive cash or another financial instrument from the first entity.
l Stock Option Plans
On April 1, 1996, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement of Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, which permits entities to recognize as expense over the vesting
period the fair value of all stock-based awards on the date of grant.
Alternatively, SFAS No. 123 also allows entities to continue to apply the
provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and provide pro forma net income and pro forma
earnings per share disclosures for employee stock option grants made in 1995 and
later years as if the fair-value-based method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been
applied. The Company has elected to continue to apply the provisions of APB
Opinion No. 25 and provide the pro forma disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123.
m Management Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
n Net Earnings Loss Per Share
Effective with the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 SFAS No. 128. SFAS No. 128
replaced the calculation of primary and fully diluted earnings per share with
basic and diluted earnings per share. Unlike primary earnings per share, basic
earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of stock options. Diluted
earnings per share is similar to the previously reported fully diluted earnings
per share. For all years presented, basic and diluted earnings per share are the
same, and there was no effect on previously reported earnings per share.
Earnings loss per share has been computed using the number of shares of common
stock and common stock options and warrants outstanding, assuming conversion of
all outstanding preferred stock to 751,111 shares of common stock. The weighted
average number of shares used in computing both basic and diluted earnings
loss per share was 3,391,621, 4,330,239, and 5,291,381 for fiscal 1996, 1997,
and 1998, respectively. The weighted average number of shares was based on
common stock outstanding for basic earnings loss per share and common stock
outstanding and common stock options and warrants for diluted earnings loss
per share in periods when such common stock options and warrants are not
antidilutive.
2 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In August 1996, the Company determined to pursue the divestiture of the database
and document services businesses and, accordingly, has reflected the results of
operations of such businesses as discontinued operations. A provision of
$350,000 was made as of June 30, 1996 to reflect the anticipated loss from
operations until the time of disposal. On January 31, 1997, the Company sold
substantially all of the assets of the document services business to Sterling
Direct, Inc., the largest customer of the division. The sales price, after
giving effect to the post-closing adjustments, was $1,241,000. Of the amount 200,000 is in the
39
41 form of an 8%, three-year subordinated note and the remainder was paid in cash.
The net assets related to this sale were approximately $566,000. As of March 31,
1997 and 1998, the Company provided additional provisions for loss, net of tax,
in the amount of $550,000 and $374,000, respectively. The Company anticipates
disposition of the remaining operations through sale during fiscal 1999.
The Company has classified the database and document services businesses as a
discontinued operation and has reclassified the prior period statements of
operations to reflect this change.
Summary balance sheet data as of March 31, 1998 and 1997 is as follows                               1998   1997

43 7 FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS
In June 1996, the Company entered into a loan agreement to secure additional
debt of $4,000,000, through a subordinated note payable, $3,350,000 of which was
funded as of June 30, 1996 and $650,000 of which was funded August 15, 1996. The
loan, which was due and payable on July 1, 2001, bore interest at 1325% with
an effective interest rate of 1925% and required the granting of a security
interest in the Company tangible and intangible assets. In connection with
this loan, the Company issued warrants for 138,142 shares of common stock,
exercisable at $01 per share, for which $879,000 of value was ascribed.
The Company used a portion of the net proceeds of its initial public offering to
repay the amounts outstanding under its various financing arrangements. The
repayment of the subordinated note payable resulted in an extraordinary loss on
early extinguishment of debt of $1,180,000 and a related tax benefit of
$209,000.
Subsequent to March 31, 1998, the Company secured a $5,000,000 line of credit
facility with a commercial bank. Outstanding borrowings, if any, will bear
interest at LIBOR plus 225% and will be secured by accounts receivable and
inventory. 8 LEASES
The Company has noncancellable operating leases, primarily for office space and
office equipment, that expire through 2003 and provide for purchase or renewal
options. During 1991, a partnership, which included the president of the
Company, acquired the building where the Company headquarters are housed. Rent
paid to the partnership amounted to $422,600 in 1996. The partnership sold the
building to an unrelated party in March 1996. Total rent expense for operating leases, including contingent rentals, was
$708,000 in 1998, $578,000 in 1997, and $595,000 in 1996.
Future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases as of March
31, 1998 are as follows                                  IN THOUSANDS

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the
scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income,
and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. TALX and its subsidiaries
carry separate tax histories and, as a result, certain net operating loss
carryforwards are available to offset future taxable income of TALX. In order to
fully realize the deferred tax assets, TALX will need to generate future taxable
income of approximately $4,000,000 prior to the expiration of the net operating
loss carryforwards in 2013. Taxable loss of TALX for the years ended March 31,
1998, 1997, and 1996 was $3,138,000, $608,000, and $934,000, respectively. Based
upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable
income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management
believes it is more likely than not the Company will realize the benefits of
these deductible differences.
At March 31, 1998, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal
income tax purposes of $6,900,000, which are available to offset future federal
taxable income, if any, through 2013. In addition, the Company has alternative
minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately $22,000, which are available
to reduce future federal regular income taxes, if any, over an indefinite
period.
10 STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
In July 1996, the Company Board of Directors authorized and amended the
Company articles of incorporation to effect a 1-for-35 reverse stock split
for each share of common stock and adjusted all outstanding common stock options
and warrants accordingly. The Board of Directors also authorized and amended the
Company articles of incorporation to effect a reduction in all series of
preferred stock and common stock par value to $01. All share data presented
within the consolidated financial statements have been revised to effect for the
reverse stock split and changes in par value.
In July 1996, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to provide that
the aggregate number of shares of common stock the Company shall have the
authority to issue shall be 30,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $01
per share, and 13,700,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $01 per share,
8,700,000 shares of which represent the previously designated Series A, B and C
convertible preferred stock.
All series of convertible preferred stock were converted into common stock upon
completion of the Company initial public offering. Upon the closing, the
Company filed an amendment to its articles of incorporation to reduce the number
of authorized shares of preferred stock to 5,000,000.
TALX has adopted two incentive stock option plans for employees which provide
for the issuance of a maximum of 619,109 shares of common stock. Options are
granted by the Board of Directors at prices not less than fair market value as
of the date of the grant. Certain options are 100% vested upon grant. The
remaining options vest 20% per year and expire six years after the date of the
grant.                    44

TALX has adopted a stock option plan for outside directors which provides for
the issuance of a maximum of 80,000 shares of common stock. Options are granted
in the amount of 1,500 shares each to outside directors at prices not less than
fair market value as of the date of the grant, which is April 1 of each year.
The options vest one year from the date of grant. Options granted amount to
6,000 at March 31, 1998.
The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Accordingly, no compensation cost has
been recognized for the stock option plans. Had compensation cost for the
Company stock option plans been determined based on the fair value at the
grant date for awards in fiscal 1997 and fiscal 1998 consistent with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company net loss and net loss per share would
have been impacted by an immaterial amount less than $01 per share in each
year.
The Company made calculations under SFAS No. 123 reflecting only options granted
in fiscal 1997 and fiscal 1998. Therefore, the full impact of calculating
compensation cost for stock options under SFAS No. 123 was not reflected in the
determination of the impact, because compensation cost is reflected over the
options' vesting period of six years and compensation cost for options granted
prior to April 1, 1995 is not considered. The fair value of option grants for
fiscal 1997 and fiscal 1998 is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions: expected volatility of 65% in fiscal 1997 and 85% in fiscal 1998;
risk-free interest rate of 644% in fiscal 1997 and 619% in fiscal 1998;
expected life of 6 years for both periods; and an expected dividend yield of
00% in both periods.                     OPTIONS OUTSTANDING                OPTIONS EXERCISABLE

47 During fiscal 1997, the shareholders approved the TALX Corporation 1996 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan ESPP. The ESPP allows eligible employees the right to
purchase common stock on a quarterly basis at the lower of 85% of the market
price at the beginning or end of each three-month offering period. As of March
31, 1998, there were 80,000 shares of common stock reserved for the ESPP with
3,285 shares issued in fiscal 1997 and 34,901 shares issued in fiscal 1998.
11 DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts for the Company cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, trade receivables, income tax refund receivable, accounts payable
and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity
of these instruments. The carrying amounts of notes payable to bank, long-term
debt, and capital lease obligations approximate fair value because the interest
rates vary with or approximate market rates.
12 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company sponsors a profit-sharing/401k plan. The plan covers substantially
all of the Company employees. The Company makes contributions to the plans,
subject to ERISA limitations, up to 2% of employees' earnings. Total expense
under the plans for the years ended March 31, 1998, 1997, and 1996 was $146,000 100,000, and $91,000, respectively.
13 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is involved in certain litigation matters arising in the normal
course of business. In the opinion of Company management, these matters will not
