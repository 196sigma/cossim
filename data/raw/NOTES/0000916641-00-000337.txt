TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF
AMF BOWLING, INC.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AMF Bowl-
ing, Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999
and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows,
stockholders' equity and comprehensive loss for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1999. These financial statements are the responsi-
bility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opin-
ion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of mate-
rial misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence sup-
porting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement pre-
sentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opin-
ion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of AMF Bowling, Inc. and sub-
sidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their opera-
tions and their cash flows for each of the three years ended December 31,
1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1. BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
Organization
AMF Bowling, Inc. AMF Bowling and its subsidiaries collectively, the
Company or AMF are principally engaged in two business segments: i the
ownership or operation of bowling centers, consisting of 417 U.S. bowling cen-
ters and 122 international bowling centers Bowling Centers, including 15
joint venture centers described in Note 16. Joint Ventures, as of December
31, 1999, and ii the manufacture and sale of bowling equipment such as auto-
matic pinspotters, automatic scoring equipment, bowling pins, lanes, ball re-
turns, certain spare parts, and the resale of allied products such as bowling
balls, bags, shoes, and certain other spare parts Bowling Products. The
principal markets for bowling equipment are U.S. and international bowling
center operators. AMF also manufactures and sells the PlayMaster, Highland and
Renaissance brands of billiards tables, and owns the Michael Jordan Golf Com-
pany, which currently operates two golf practice ranges.
AMF Bowling Worldwide, Inc., Bowling Worldwide, is a wholly-owned, di-
rect subsidiary of AMF Group Holdings Inc. AMF Group Holdings. AMF Group
Holdings is a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of AMF Bowling. AMF Bowling, AMF
Group Holdings and Bowling Worldwide are Delaware corporations. AMF Bowling
and AMF Group Holdings are holding companies. The principal assets in each are
comprised of investments in subsidiaries. The Company was acquired in 1996 by
an investor group led by affiliates of Goldman, Sachs & Co. the Acquisi-
tion.
Since the Acquisition and prior to December 31, 1999, the Company has ac-
quired 263 bowling centers for a combined purchase price of $4989 million,
and it has constructed two bowling centers and one Michael Jordan Golf prac-
tice range as part of its capital expenditure program. The Company has funded
its acquisitions and center construction from internally generated cash,
borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility the Bank Fa-
cility under the Credit Agreement as defined in Note 8.--Long-Term Debt
and Recapitalization Plan, and issuances of AMF Bowling common stock the
Common Stock. See Note 15.--Acquisitions.
Risks and Other Important Factors
The Company is highly leveraged as a result of indebtedness incurred in
connection with the Acquisition and subsequent bowling center acquisitions.
The Company ability to make scheduled payments of principal of, or to pay
interest on, or to refinance its indebtedness depends on its future perfor-
mance, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial,
competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond its control, in-
cluding the conditions of the debt and equity markets. Based upon the current
level of performance, management believes that cash flow from operations, to-
gether with available borrowings under the Credit Agreement and other sources
of liquidity, will be adequate to meet the Company requirements for working
capital, capital expenditures, scheduled payments of principal of, and inter-
est on, its senior debt, and interest on the Subsidiary Notes for the year
2000. In calendar year 2001, principal payment obligations under the facili-
ties of the Credit Agreement increase significantly, cash interest becomes
payable on the Subsidiary Senior Subordinated Discount Notes and the covenants
under the Credit Agreement will be reset to their original levels. Based on
current levels of performance, the Company anticipates that some form of refi-
nancing will be required to meet the Company financial requirements for cal-
endar years 2001 and beyond. There can be no assurance, however, that the
Company business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that
future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable the Com-
pany to meet its payment obligations under its indebtedness, or make necessary
capital expenditures, or that any refinancing would be available on commer-
cially reasonable terms or at all.                    36            AMF BOWLING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. All dollar amounts are
in thousands, except where otherwise indicated.
Joint Ventures
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method.
These investments are managed as part of the Company Bowling Centers segment
operations, and the Company share of joint venture earnings is included in
earnings for the Bowling Centers segment. The Company is amortizing the excess
of the investment over its equity in its Brazilian joint venture net assets
over a period not to exceed five years. See Note 16. Joint Ventures.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally ac-
cepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assump-
tions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclo-
sure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the report-
ing periods. The more significant estimates made by management include allow-
ances for obsolete inventory, uncollectible accounts receivable, realization
of goodwill, deferred taxes and other deferred assets, litigation and claims,
product warranty costs, and self-insurance costs. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition
For Bowling Products, revenue is generally recognized at the time the prod-
ucts are shipped. In certain countries, with respect to new center packages
NCP or NCPs which include all the equipment necessary to outfit a new
bowling center or expand an existing bowling center orders, revenue is recog-
nized upon installation. For larger contract orders, Bowling Products gener-
ally requires that customers submit a deposit as a condition of accepting the
order. For a significant portion of international sales, Bowling Products gen-
erally requires the customer to obtain a letter of credit prior to shipment.
Warranty Costs
Bowling Products warrants all new products for certain periods up to one
year. Bowling Products charges to income an estimated amount for future war-
ranty obligations, and also offers customers the option to purchase extended
warranties on certain products. Warranty expense aggregated $5,681 for 1999 5,391 for 1998, and $3,007 for 1997, and is included in cost of goods sold in
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company classifies all highly liquid fixed-income investments purchased
with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.
Inventories
Bowling Products' inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, cost
being determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method. Bowling Cen-
ters' inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, with the cost being
determined using the average cost method. See Note 3.--Inventories.
Long-Lived Assets
The carrying value of long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangi-
bles, including goodwill, is reviewed by the Company for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
37            AMF BOWLING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
of an asset may not be recoverable, and an estimate of future undiscounted
cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the
life of an asset are charged to expense as incurred; major renewals or
betterments are capitalized. Upon retirement or sale of an asset, its cost and
related accumulated depreciation are removed from property and equipment, and
any gain or loss is recognized.
Property and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives
using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives of property and equip-
ment are as follows  Buildings and improvements   5-40 years
Leasehold improvements     lesser of the estimated useful life or term of
the lease
Bowling and related equipment 5-10 years
Manufacturing equipment    2-7 years
Furniture and fixtures     3-8 years Goodwill
As a result of the Acquisition and subsequent purchases of bowling centers
discussed in Note 15. Acquisitions, and in accordance with the purchase
method of accounting used for all acquisitions, the Company recorded goodwill
representing the excess of the purchase price over the allocation among the
acquired assets and liabilities in accordance with estimates of fair market
value on the dates of acquisition. Goodwill is being amortized over 40 years.
Amortization expense was $21,384 in 1999, $20,403 in 1998 and $19,827 in 1997.
Accumulated amortization of goodwill was $74,684 and $53,300, respectively, at
December 31, 1999 and 1998.
Leasehold Interests
Leasehold interests are included in other assets net of accumulated amorti-
zation of $22,346 and $17,370 at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Leasehold interests represent favorable lease terms which are comprised of the
difference between amounts due under the contractual lease rate compared to
the market rate for that lease. Leasehold interests are being amortized over
the life of each lease. Amortization expense was $4,976 in 1999, $4,500 in
1998 and $11,735 in 1997.
Income Taxes
The U.S. and international subsidiaries of AMF Bowling are taxable corpora-
tions under the Internal Revenue Code IRC. Income taxes are accounted for
using the asset and liability method under which deferred income taxes are
recognized for the tax consequences on future years of temporary differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets
and liabilities.
Research and Development Costs
Expenditures relating to the development of new products, including signif-
icant improvements and refinements to existing products, are expensed as in-
curred. Amounts charged against income were approximately $342 in 1999, $121
in 1998 and $922 in 1997 and are included in cost of goods sold in the accom-
panying consolidated statements of operations.
Advertising Costs
Costs incurred for producing and communicating advertising are expensed
when incurred. The amounts charged against income were approximately $27,291
in 1999, $33,432 in 1998 and $21,642 in 1997, with
38            AMF BOWLING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 20,756, $20,571 and $12,768, respectively, included in bowling center operat-
ing expenses for Bowling Centers, and $6,535, $12,861 and $8,856, respective-
ly, included in selling, general and administrative expenses for Bowling Prod-
ucts and Corporate in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Earnings Per Share
Basic and diluted net loss per share is calculated based on the actual
weighted-average shares outstanding. Outstanding stock options and warrants
are not considered as their effect is antidilutive. See Note 12. Stockhold-
ers' Equity and Note 13. Employee Benefit Plans.
Foreign Currency Translation
All assets and liabilities of AMF Bowling international operations are
translated from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange
rates. Adjustments resulting from the translation of financial statements of
international operations into U.S. dollars are included in the foreign cur-
rency translation adjustment on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets,
statements of stockholders' equity and statements of comprehensive loss. Reve-
nue and expenses of international operations are translated using average ex-
change rates that existed during the year and reflect currency exchange gains
and losses resulting from transactions conducted in other than local curren-
cies. Transactions in foreign currencies resulted in net losses of $2,432 for
1999, net gains of $2,450 for 1998 and net losses of $3,537 for 1997, and are
included in other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of op-
erations.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying value of financial instruments, including cash and cash equiv-
alents and short-term debt, approximate fair value at December 31, 1999 and
1998, because of the short maturity of these instruments. At December 31, 1999
and 1998, fair value of the interest rate cap agreements to reduce the inter-
est rate risk of its floating rate debt was approximately $16 and $8, respec-
tively. The interest rate cap agreements are valued using the estimated amount
that the Company would receive to terminate the cap agreements as of December
31, 1999 and 1998, based on a quote from the counterparty, taking into account
current interest rates and the credit worthiness of the counterparty. The Com-
pany has no intention of terminating the cap agreements. The fair value of the

In addition, Bowling Worldwide is required to make prepayments which perma-
nently reduce the availability under the Senior Facilities under certain cir-
cumstances, including upon certain asset sales and issuances of debt by Bowl-
ing Worldwide and its subsidiaries and public issuance of equity securities of
AMF Bowling. Bowling Worldwide is also required to make prepayments that per-
manently reduce the availability under the Term Facilities in an amount equal
to up to 50% of Excess Cash Flow for any fiscal year of Bowling Worldwide if
the Total Debt/EBITDA Ratio for that fiscal year is greater than or equal to
550 to 10. If the Total Debt/EBITDA Ratio for that fiscal year is less than
550 to 10, then Bowling Worldwide is required to prepay the Bank Facility in
an amount equal to up to 50% of the Excess Cash Flow as defined in the Credit
Agreement for such fiscal year such payment would be the lesser of x 50%
of the Excess Cash Flow for that fiscal year or y the amount by which such
Excess Cash Flow exceeds $20 million, but Bowling Worldwide would be permit-
ted to reborrow such amounts, subject to the conditions of the Credit Agree-
ment.
The Senior Facilities are guaranteed by AMF Group Holdings and by each of
Bowling Worldwide present and future domestic subsidiaries and are secured
by all of the stock of Bowling Worldwide and Bowling Worldwide present and
future domestic subsidiaries and second-tier subsidiaries, by 66% of the stock
of Bowling Worldwide present and future international subsidiaries and by
substantially all of Bowling Worldwide and its present and future domestic
subsidiaries' present and future property and assets.
Covenants
In connection with the Company recapitalization plan discussed below, the
lenders under the Credit Agreement approved Amendment No. 2 and Waiver to the
Credit Agreement and entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement. The key provisions of the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agree-
ment i waive mandatory prepayment provisions previously existing under the
Credit Agreement with respect to the Company recapitalization plan, ii re-
quire AMF Bowling to contribute $300 million as equity to Bowling Worldwide
to be used to repay amounts borrowed under the Bank Facility and treat such
prepayment as prefunding for new bowling center acquisitions, iii permit the
Company to resume borrowing to fund acquisitions subject to certain criteria
and maintenance of minimum availability under the Bank Facility of $650 mil-
lion through 2000 and $400 million through 2001, iv permit AMF Bowling to
make equity contributions to Bowling Worldwide which will be included in the
calculation of EBITDA for financial covenant purposes under the Credit Agree-
ment up to an aggregate of $100 million during any four consecutive quarters
through December 31, 2001, v modify or waive certain financial covenants and
vi allow Bowling Worldwide to exclude from EBITDA covenant calculations cer-
tain restructuring and Special Charges described below.
Bowling Worldwide is in compliance with the amended covenants as of Decem-
ber 31, 1999. In this connection, AMF Bowling made contributions of $10 mil-
lion and $20 million as equity to Bowling Worldwide in November 1999 and
March 2000 to meet EBITDA requirements under its financial covenant tests as
of September 30, 1999 and December 31, 1999, respectively. The Credit Agree-
ment permits AMF Bowling to make additional equity contributions through 2001
as specified above. Management believes that Bowling Worldwide will be in com-
pliance with the amended covenants during 2000, including the effect of the
aforementioned equity contributions, but any downturn in the current perfor-
mance of Bowling Worldwide could result in non-compliance with these financial
covenants. Failure by Bowling Worldwide to comply with its Credit Agreement
covenants could result in an event of default which, if nor cured or waived,
would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants, as well as
additional affirmative and negative covenants, constraining Bowling Worldwide.
Under the terms currently in effect, Bowling Worldwide must maintain a minimum

aggregate amount of the EBITDA of each bowling center acquired or constructed
by Bowling Worldwide or any of its Subsidiaries after June 14, 1999 and
acquired or constructed at least 15 months prior to such time of
determination.

fined in the Credit Agreement as the ratio of i Modified Consolidated EBITDA
of Bowling Worldwide and its Subsidiaries during a Rolling Period to ii cash
interest payable on all Debt as defined in the Credit Agreement of Bowling
Worldwide and its Subsidiaries at an amount ranging from not less than 175
for the Rolling Period ending June 30, 1999 to not less than 275 for the

cipal amounts of all Debt under the Term Facilities payable by Bowling World-
wide and its Subsidiaries during such Rolling Period through December 31,
2001. Beginning with the Rolling Period ending March 31, 2002 and thereafter,

that Rolling Period must be maintained at levels ranging from not more than
425 for the Rolling Period ending March 31, 1999 to not more than 250 for
the Rolling Period ending March 31, 2002 and thereafter. A Total Debt to
EBITDA Ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement as the ratio of consolidated
total Debt other than Hedge Agreements of Bowling Worldwide and its Subsidi-
aries to Modified Consolidated EBITDA must be maintained at levels ranging
from not more than 750 for the Rolling Period ending March 31, 1999 to not
less than 450 for the Rolling Period ending March 31, 2002 and thereafter. In
each case, the above-mentioned ratios are calculated on a quarterly basis.
Negative covenants under the Senior Facilities prohibit Bowling Worldwide
and its Subsidiaries from incurring any liens except for those created under
the loan documents or otherwise permitted under the Credit Agreement, includ-
ing those securing Bowling Worldwide obligations as borrower on other in-
debtedness not to exceed $50 million at any time outstanding. Bowling World-
wide and its Subsidiaries are also prohibited from incurring any debt, other

interest rate risk of its Bank Debt. The notional amounts of these caps were
$200 million and $100 million, respectively, at December 31, 1999. Interest
expense for interest rate cap agreements was $140 in 1999, $1,608 in 1998 and
$1,823 in 1997.
Bowling Worldwide is exposed to credit-related loss in the event of non-
performance by the counterparty. Bowling Worldwide believes its exposure to
potential loss due to counterparty non-performance is minimized primarily due
to the relatively strong credit rating of the counterparty.
Deferred Financing Costs
Costs incurred to obtain bank financing and issue bond financing are amor-
tized over the lives of the various types of debt using the effective interest
rate method. Bank financing costs, which were incurred to obtain bank financ-
ing for the Acquisition, were entirely written off in the fourth quarter of
1997 in connection with the Credit Agreement. During 1998, the Company de-
ferred $13,833 of financing costs associated with the issuance of the Deben-
tures and with the Amendment No. 2 and Waiver. Amortization expense for fi-
nancing costs was $2,686 in 1999, $3,438 in 1998 and $4,856 in 1997.
Extraordinary Items
1999
As discussed above, the Company recorded an extraordinary gain of approxi-
mately $639 million in connection with its Recapitalization Plan representing
the difference between the accreted value of the Debentures purchased and the
purchase price therefor net of expenses of the tender offer.
1997
The Company recorded after-tax extraordinary charges totaling $234 mil-
lion, net of $128 million of tax, in the fourth quarter of 1997 as a result
of entering into the Credit Agreement, the premium paid to redeem a portion of
the Subsidiary Senior Subordinated Discount Notes and the write-off of the
portion of bond financing costs attributable to the Subsidiary Senior Subordi-
nated Discount Notes redeemed.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Other
The Company is highly leveraged as a result of indebtedness incurred in
connection with the Acquisition and subsequent bowling center acquisitions.
Based upon the current level of performance, management believes that cash
flow from operations, together with available borrowings under the Credit
Agreement and other sources of liquidity, will be adequate to meet the
Company requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, scheduled
payments of principal of, and interest on, its Senior Debt, and interest on
the Subsidiary Notes for the year 2000. In calendar year 2001, principal pay-
ment obligations under the facilities of the Credit Agreement increase signif-
icantly and cash interest becomes payable on the Subsidiary Senior Subordi-
nated Discount Notes. Based on current levels of performance, the Company
anticipates that a refinancing will be required to the meet the Company fi-
nancial requirements for calendar years 2001 and beyond. There is no assur-
ance, however, that the Company will generate sufficient cash flow in a timely
manner to satisfy scheduled principal and interest payments or that any refi-
nancing would be available at commercially reasonable terms or at all.
NOTE 9. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND SPECIAL CHARGES
Restructuring Charges
In 1999, the Company recorded restructuring charges of approximately $85
million that were related primarily to a plan to reorganize and downsize the
Bowling Products business in response to market weakness in the Asia Pacific
region and increased competition which has negatively impacted sales and prof-
itability of NCPs. The restructuring plan was developed in conjunction with a
strategic business assessment performed by Bain & Co. and was designed to re-
duce the overall volatility of the Bowling Products business. Actions taken
included closing one plant in the U.S., and one plant in Korea, three ware-
houses in China, one warehouse in Taiwan, four sales offices in China and one
sales office in Belgium. Additionally, sales offices were downsized in four
other countries. The restructuring charges relate primarily to employee termi-
nation benefits, assetwrite-offs and contract cancellations. As of December
31, 1999, the Company had a remaining reserve related to the restructuring
charges of $06 million.
Asset Impairment Charges
In 1999, the Company recorded asset impairment charges of $81 million rep-
resenting the difference between fair market value and carrying value of im-
paired assets. The asset impairment charges relate to under- performing bowl-
ing center locations that under a formal plan will be closed in the first half
of 2000. Fair market value is generally determined based on the average sales
proceeds from previous sales of idle AMF bowling center locations.

The strategic assessment by Bain & Co. discussed above led to programs de-
signed to improve product line profitability and quality in the Company. This
assessment was a catalyst to the Company recording certain charges. These
charges, along with additional reserves collectively, the Special Charges
recorded by the Company totaled $265 million. The Special Charges are non-
cash, relate primarily to receivables and inventory and are included within
operating expenses.

Realization of deferred tax assets associated with the net operating losses
NOLs and foreign tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating
sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration. Management believes that
there is a risk that certain of these NOLs and foreign tax credit
carryforwards may expire unused and, accordingly, has established a valuation
allowance against them.
As of December 31, 1999, the Company had net operating losses of approxi-
mately $2636 million and foreign tax credits of $115 million that will carry
over to future years to offset U.S. taxes. The foreign tax credits will begin
to expire in the year 2001 and the net operating losses will begin to expire
in the year 2011. The Company has recorded a valuation reserve as of December
31, 1999 for $1130 million related to net operating losses, foreign tax cred-
its and other deferred tax assets that the Company may not utilize prior to
their expirations. The tax provision recorded for 1999 reflects an increase in
the valuation allowance and certain international taxes.
The gross amount of NOLs the Company may utilize on future tax returns is
$236,618. The NOLs expire as follows    Year                                NOLs

Bowling Centers and Bowling Products lease certain facilities and equipment
under operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2016. Bowling
Centers has certain ground leases, associated with several centers, which ex-
pire at various dates through 2058. These leases generally contain renewal op-
tions and require payments of taxes, insurance, maintenance, and other ex-
penses in addition to the minimum annual rentals. Certain leases require
contingent payments based on usage of equipment above certain specified lev-
els. Such contingent rentals amounted to $2,430 in 1999, $1,733 in 1998 and
$1,200 in 1997. Total rent expense under operating leases aggregated approxi-
mately $32,892 in 1999, $31,061 in 1998 and $24,117 in 1997.

Litigation and Claims
In June 1998, Harbin Hai Heng Bowling Entertainment Co. Ltd. Hai Heng
filed an action against a subsidiary of AMF Bowling in Heilongjing, China. Hai
Heng sought to recover $3 to $4 million in damages relating to NCPs purchased
from AMF. Hai Heng asserted that the poor quality of NCPs entitled Hai Heng to
recover the purchase price and damages for lost profits and the cost of stor-
ing the NCPs. In November 1998, the court awarded Hai Heng approximately $35
million. The Company appealed to the next higher court of Heilongjing Prov-
ince, which issued a judgment in favor of Hai Heng for approximately $28 mil-
lion and ordered Hai Heng to return 24 NCPs to AMF.
51            AMF BOWLING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
The Company believes Hai Heng claim is a warranty issue and that Hai Heng
is not entitled to recover the purchase price, lost profits or the cost of
storage. The Company also believes that Hai Heng claim is substantially
without merit and, based on the advice of local legal counsel, believes that
the judicial process leading up to the trial court judgment involved signif-
icant procedural and other legal defects. Following the award, Hai Heng began
to exercise its rights to collect the judgment. The Company appealed to the
Supreme People Court in Beijing the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ac-
cepted the file and told AMF attorneys that it will hear the appeal but has
not issued a written order accepting the appeal.
Due to a number of uncertainties inherent in litigation in China, the Com-
pany can give no assurance on the likelihood of success of the appeal or the
ultimate outcome. However, management does not believe that the outcome will
have a material adverse impact on the financial position of the Company.
On April 22, 1999, a putative class action was filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York by Vulcan International
Corporation against AMF Bowling, The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P., Goldman, Sachs
& Co., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Cowen & Company, Schroder & Co.,
Inc., Richard A. Friedman and Douglas J. Stanard. The complaint has subse-
quently been amended to, among other things, include additional named plain-
tiffs. The plaintiffs, as putative class representatives for all persons who
purchased the Common Stock in the Initial Public Offering or within 25 days of
the effective date of the registration statement related to the Initial Public
Offering, seek, among other things, damages and/or rescission against all de-
fendants jointly and severally pursuant to Sections 11, 12 and/or 15 of the
Securities Act of 1933 based on allegedly inaccurate and misleading disclo-
sures in connection with and following the Initial Public Offering. Management
believes that the litigation is without merit and intends to defend it vigor-
ously.
In addition, the Company currently and from time to time is subject to
claims and actions arising in the ordinary course of its business, including
environmental claims, discrimination claims, workers' compensation claims and
personal injury claims from customers of Bowling Centers. In some actions,
plaintiffs request punitive or other damages that may not be covered by insur-
ance. In management opinion, the claims and actions in which the Company is
involved will not have a material adverse impact on its financial position or
results of operations. However, it is not possible to predict the outcome of
such claims and actions.
NOTE 12. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Stockholders' Agreement
On April 30, 1996, AMF Bowling and the institutional stockholders of AMF
Bowling the Stockholders entered into a stockholders' agreement the
Stockholders' Agreement which regulates the relationship among AMF Bowling
and the Stockholders'. The Stockholders' Agreement primarily provides for,
subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the establishment and nomina-
tion of the Board of Directors and an Executive Committee and guidance in the
event a Stockholder determines to sell its shares of Common Stock. The forego-
ing rights and obligations will terminate in the event of any merger, recapi-
talization, consolidation, reorganization or other restructuring of AMF Bowl-
ing as a result of which the Stockholders own less than a majority of the
outstanding voting power of the entity surviving such transaction, the Stock-
holders' Agreement will terminate.

NOTE 13. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has a defined contribution 401k plan to which U.S. employees
may make voluntary contributions based on their compensation. Under the provi-
sions of the plan, beginning on January 1, 1999, the Company matches 100% of
the first 3% and 50% of the next 2% of employee contributions. Prior to Janu-
ary 1, 1999, the Company could, at its option, match a discretionary percent-
age of employee contributions. The Company may make an additional profit-shar-
ing contribution as determined by the Board of Directors. Employer
contributions made prior to January 1, 1999 vest 100 percent on the fifth an-
niversary of employment. Employer contributions made subsequent to December
31, 1998 vest 100 percent immediately. The amounts charged to expense under
this plan were $2,174 in 1999, $0 in 1998 and $1,779 in 1997.
Certain of the Company international operations have employee benefit
plans covering selected employees. These plans vary as to the funding, includ-
ing local government, employee, and employer funding. Each international oper-
ation has provided for pension expense and made contributions to these plans
in accordance with the requirements of the plans and local country practices.
The amounts that were charged to expense under these plans aggregated $875 in
1999, $974 in 1998 and $814 in 1997.
The Company has employment agreements with certain executives that provide
for salaries and bonuses if certain operational and financial targets are met

provide for payment of accrued compensation, continuation of certain benefits,
severance payments, payment of a portion of the executive bonus and vesting
of options to purchase shares of Common Stock Stock Options following ter-
mination of employment by Bowling Worldwide under certain circumstances. No
amounts were committed for future salaries at December 31, 1999.
1996 Stock Incentive Plan
In connection with the Acquisition, AMF Bowling adopted a stock incentive
plan the 1996 Plan under which AMF Bowling may grant incentive awards in
the form of shares of Common Stock, Stock Options, and stock appreciation
rights to certain officers, employees, consultants, and non-employee directors
Participants of AMF Bowling and its affiliates. The total number of shares
of Common Stock reserved and available for grant under the 1996 Plan is
1,767,151. A committee of AMF Bowling Board of Directors the Committee
is authorized to make grants and various other decisions under the 1996 Plan
and to make determinations as to a number of the terms of awards granted under
the 1996 Plan. In 1999, the Company did not grant any Stock Options under the
1996 Plan. In 1998 and 1997, the Committee granted Stock Options to Partici-
pants to purchase a total of 32,000 and 702,000 shares of Common Stock, re-
spectively. The 1998 Stock Options were granted at an exercise price of $100
per share. The 1997 Stock Options were granted at an exercise price of $1000
per share. The Stock Options granted in 1998 vest on the one-year anniversary
of the grant date. With respect to the 1997 Stock Options, twenty percent of
the options vest on each of the first five anniversaries of the grant dates.
Stock Options are nontransferable except under certain limited circumstances
and, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, have a term of ten years.
The number of Stock Options outstanding to all employees including members
of senior management, and directors under the 1996 Plan at December 31, 1999,
1998 and 1997 total 1,185,650, 1,307,250 and 1,572,000, respectively. Of the
total Stock Options awarded under the 1996 Plan, 591,150 were exercisable dur-
ing 1999 and 522,400 were exercisable during 1998. Of the exercisable Stock

1998 Stock Incentive Plan
Under the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan the 1998 Plan, AMF Bowling may
grant to employees of the Company and its affiliates incentive awards
Awards in the form of Stock Options, stock appreciation rights and shares
of Common Stock that are subject to certain terms and conditions. The total
number of shares of Common Stock reserved and available for grant under the
1998 Plan is four million. In addition, shares of Common Stock that have been
reserved but not issued under the 1996 Plan, and shares which are subject to
awards under the 1996 Plan that expire or otherwise terminate, may be granted
as Awards pursuant to the 1998 Plan. There are 513,951 shares of Common Stock
under the 1996 Plan available for grant of awards under that plan.
Shares allocated to Awards granted under the 1998 Plan which are later for-
feited, expire or otherwise terminate including shares subject to Stock Ap-
preciation Rights that are exercised for cash may again be used for Awards
under the 1998 Plan. No more than 200,000 shares of Common Stock may be allo-
cated to the Awards granted under the 1998 Plan to a Participant in any one
year.
In 1999 and 1998, 1,523,000 and 950,400 Stock Options, respectively were
granted as Awards under the 1998 Plan. Twenty percent of the Stock Options
vest on each of the first five anniversaries of the grants. The number of
Stock Options outstanding to senior management, other employees, and directors

respectively. Of the total Stock Options awarded under the 1998 Plan, 156,030
were exercisable in 1999 and none were exercisable during 1998. Forfeited
Stock Options totaled 151,500 in 1999 and 55,750 in 1998.
In 1999, the chief executive officer of the Company was granted Stock Op-
tions to purchase 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock the CEO Stock Options.
The CEO Stock Options were not granted pursuant to the 1996 Plan or the 1998

granted at an exercise price of $528 per share. Twenty percent of the CEO
Stock Options vest on the grant date and on each of the first four anniversa-
ries of the grant date.
The weighted-average fair value of 1998 Plan Stock Options and CEO Stock
Options granted during 1999 and 1998 is $308 and $487 per option, respec-
tively. The 3,266,150 options outstanding at December 31, 1999 have a
weighted-average exercise price of $668 and a weighted-average remaining con-
tractual life of 93 years.
The 1998 Plan will terminate ten years after its effective date; however,
awards outstanding as of such date will not be affected or impaired by such
termination. The Board and the Committee have authority to amend the 1998 Plan
and awards granted thereunder, subject to the terms of the 1998 Plan.

by the 1998 Plan and is subject to the Stockholders Agreement. One-third of
the Restricted Stock vests on each of the first three anniversaries of the
grant. The Company will record compensation expense related to the issuance of
this Common Stock over the vesting period.
In 1996, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Com-
pensation, and elected to account for its stock options under APB Opinion No.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued NOTE 16. JOINT VENTURES
In April 1997, the Company entered into a joint venture with Hong Leong
Corporation Limited, a Singapore-based conglomerate Hong Leong, to build
and operate bowling centers in the Asia Pacific region. The joint venture
Hong Leong Joint Venture is owned 50% by the Company and 50% by Hong
Leong. The Hong Leong Joint Venture opened its only bowling center during No-
vember 1997 in Tianjin, China. Due to the economic difficulties in the Asia
Pacific region, future development of bowling centers in that region through
the Hong Leong Joint Venture will not be pursued.
In August 1997, the Company entered into a joint venture with Playcenter
S.A., a Sao Paulo-based amusement and entertainment company Playcenter to
build and operate bowling centers in Brazil and Argentina. The joint venture
Playcenter Joint Venture is owned 50% by the Company and 50% by
Playcenter. As of December 31, 1999, the Playcenter Joint Venture operated 12
centers in Brazil and two centers in Argentina. No additional sites for the
Playcenter Joint Venture are being evaluated. The Company and Playcenter have
pledged their shares of the Playcenter Joint Venture in connection with a
guarantee of a third party loan to the Playcenter Joint Venture.
