These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

AND SUBSIDIARIESReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and StockholdersDarling International Inc.:We have audited Darling International Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December28, 2013, based on criteria established inInternal Control - Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO 1992. Darling International Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Darling International Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December28, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO 1992.During 2013, Darling International Inc. acquired Terra Renewal Services TRS and Rothsay and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of Darling International Inc. internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2013 TRS and Rothsay internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $7986 million and total revenues of $498 million included in the consolidated financial statements of Darling International Inc. and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 28, 2013. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Darling International Inc. also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of TRS and Rothsay.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Darling International Inc. and subsidiaries as of December28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December28, 2013, and our report dated February 26, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements./S/ KPMG LLPDallas, TexasFebruary 26, 2014Page 78DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNOTE 1.GENERALa NATURE OF OPERATIONSDarling International Inc., a Delaware corporation Darling, and together with its subsidiaries, the Company, is a leading provider of rendering, used cooking oil and bakery residual recycling and recovery solutions to the U.S. and Canadian food industry. Darling collects and recycles animal by-products, bakery residual and used cooking oil from poultry and meat processors, commercial bakeries, grocery stores, butcher shops, and food service establishments and provides grease trap cleaning services to many of the same establishments. The Company operates over 130processing and transfer facilities located throughout the United States and Canada to process raw materials into finished products such as protein primarily meat and bone meal MBM and poultry meal PM, hides, fats primarily bleachable fancy tallow BFT, poultry grease PG and yellow grease YG and bakery by-products BBP as well as a range of branded and value-added products.The Company sells these products domestically and internationally, primarily to producers of animal feed, pet food, fertilizer, bio-fuels and other consumer and industrial ingredients including oleo-chemicals, soaps and leather goods for use as ingredients in their products or for further processing.As further discussed in Note 2, on October 28, 2013, Darling completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Rothsay Rothsay, a division of Maple Leaf Foods, Inc. MFI, a Canadian corporation, pursuant to an Acquisition Agreement between MFI and Darling dated August 23, 2013 the Rothsay Acquisition.  The Company fiscal 2013year end results include 9weeks of contribution from the assets acquired in the Rothsay Acquisition. The Company operations are currently organized into twosegments: Rendering and Bakery. For additional information on the Companys segments, see Note 21.bSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES1 Basis of PresentationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation2Fiscal YearThe Company has a 52/53week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest December 31.Fiscal years for the consolidated financial statements included herein are for the 52weeks ended December28, 2013, the 52weeks ended December29, 2012, and the 52weeks ended December31, 20113 Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all short-term highly liquid instruments, with an original maturity of three months or less, to be cash equivalents4 Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful AccountsThe Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers non-payment of trade accounts receivable owed to the Company.These trade receivables arise in the ordinary course of business from sales of raw material, finished product or services to the Companys customers.The estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the Companys bad debt experience, prevailing market conditions, and aging of trade accounts receivable, among other factors.If the financial condition of the Companys customers deteriorates, resulting in the customers inability to pay the Companys receivables as they come due, additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required5 InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.Cost is primarily determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method.Page 84DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued6 Long Lived AssetsProperty, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of assets:1 Buildings and improvements, 15to 30years;2 Machinery and equipment, 3to 10years; 3 Vehicles, 3to 8years; and 4 Aircraft, 7to 10years.Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and expenditures for major renewals and improvements are capitalized.Intangible AssetsIntangible assets with indefinite lives, and therefore, not subject to amortization, consist of trade names acquired in the acquisition of Griffin Industries Inc. on December 17, 2010 which was subsequently converted to a limited liability company and its subsidiaries Griffin.Intangible assets subject to amortization consist of:1 collection routes which are made up of groups of suppliers of raw materials in similar geographic areas from which the Company derives collection fees and a dependable source of raw materials for processing into finished products;2 permits that represent licensing of operating plants that have been acquired, giving those plants the ability to operate; 3 non-compete agreements that represent contractual arrangements with former competitors whose businesses were acquired;4 trade names; and 5 royalty, consulting and leasehold agreements.Amortization expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from:5to 21years for collection routes; 10to 20years for permits; 3to 7years for non-compete covenants; and 4to 15years for trade names.Royalty, consulting and leaseholdagreements are amortized over the term of the agreement7 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed ofThe Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset, or related asset group, may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows.Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group.If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount for which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.In fiscal 2013, 2012and 2011no such events occurred requiring that the Company perform testing of its long-lived assets for  and indefinite lived assets are tested for impairment annually as of the balance sheet date or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.The Company follows a two-step process for testing impairment.First, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine whether an indication of impairment exists.If impairment is indicated, then the fair value of the reporting units goodwill is determined by allocating the units fair value of its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.The amount of impairment for goodwill is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its implied fair value.In fiscal 2013, 2012and 2011, the fair values of the Companys reporting units containing goodwill exceeded the related carrying values.Goodwill was approximately $7016 millionand $3814 millionat December28, 2013and December29, 2012, respectively.See Note 7 for further information on the Companys goodwill. Page 85DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued9Environmental ExpendituresEnvironmental expenditures incurred to mitigate or prevent environmental impacts that have yet to occur and that otherwise may result from future operations are capitalized.Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed or charged against established environmental reserves.Reserves are established when environmental impacts have been identified which are probable to require mitigation and/or remediation and the costs are reasonably estimable10Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method.Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.The Company periodically assesses whether it is more likely than not that it will be able to realize its deferred income tax assets.In making this determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence and makes certain assumptions.The Company considers, among other things, its deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, its historical earnings and losses, current industry trends and its outlook for taxable income in future years.The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority. Adjustments are made to the reserves for uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change or additional information is available. Judgment is required to assess the impact of ongoing audits conducted by tax authorities in determining the Companys consolidated income tax provision. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties on tax related matters as a component of income tax expense. 11Earnings per ShareBasic income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares including non-vested and restricted shares with participation rights outstanding during the period.Diluted income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased by dilutive common equivalent shares determined using the treasury stock method. As a result of the use of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, the full effect of the issuance of 46,000,000shares during the fourth quarter as discussed in Note 14, is not included in the below earnings per share calculations for fiscal 2013.Net Income per Common Share in thousandsDecember 28,December 29,December   of dilutive securitiesAdd: Option shares in the money and dilutive effect of nonvested stock848806972Less: Pro-forma treasury   86DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedFor fiscal 2013, 2012and 2011, respectively, 135,733, 207,890and 63,272outstanding stock options were excluded from diluted income per common share as the effect was antidilutive.For fiscal 2013, 2012and 2011, respectively, 57,257, 105,486and 330,268non-vested stock were excluded from diluted income per common share as the effect was antidilutive12Stock Based CompensationThe Company recognizes compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the share-based payments e.g., stock options and non-vested and restricted stock granted to employees and non-employee directors or by incurring liabilities to an employee or other supplier a in amounts based, at least in part, on the price of the entitys shares or other equity instruments, or b that require or may require settlement by issuing the entitys equity shares or other equity instruments.Total stock-based compensation recognized in the statement of operations for the years ended December28, 2013, December29, 2012and December31, 2011was approximately $94 million, $89 millionand $39 million, respectively, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, and the related income tax benefit recognized was approximately $37 million, $35 millionand $19 million, respectively.See Note 14 for further information on the Companys stock-based compensation plans.The benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense are reported as a financing cash flow.For the year ended December28, 2013, December29, 2012and December31, 2011the Company recognized $11 million, $27 millionand $11 millionas an increase in financing cash flows related to such deductions13Use of EstimatesThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.Actual results could differ from those estimates.If it is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect on the financial statements of a condition, situation, or set of circumstances that exist at the date of the financial statements will change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events, and the effect of the change would be material to the financial statements, the Company will disclose the nature of the uncertainty and include an indication that it is at least reasonably possible that a change in the estimate will occur in the near term.If the estimate involves certain loss contingencies, the disclosure will also include an estimate of the probable loss or range of loss or state that an estimate cannot be made14Financial InstrumentsThe carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The Company term loans and revolver borrowings outstanding at December28, 2013, as described in Note 11 have a fair value based on market valuation from a third-party bank. At December28, 2013, the Company term loans had a fair value of approximately $3417 millioncompared to a carrying amount of $3400 millionand the Company revolving loans had a fair value of approximately $2824 millioncompared to a carry amount of $2867 millionat December28, 2013. The Company had no term and revolving borrowings outstanding at December29, 2012. The carrying amount for the Companys other debt is not deemed to be significantly different than the carrying value and all other financial instruments' fair values have been disclosed in Note 18. Page 87DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued15Derivative InstrumentsThe Company makes limited use of derivative instruments to manage cash flow risks related to interest expense, natural gas usage, diesel fuel usage, inventory, forecasted sales and foreign currency exchange rates.The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes.Interest rate swaps are entered into with the intent of managing overall borrowing costs by reducing the potential impact of increases in interest rates on floating-rate long-term debt.Natural gas swaps and options are entered into with the intent of managing the overall cost of natural gas usage by reducing the potential impact of seasonal weather demands on natural gas that increases natural gas prices.Heating oil swaps and options are entered into with the intent of managing the overall cost of diesel fuel usage by reducing the potential impact of seasonal weather demands on diesel fuel that increases diesel fuel prices.Inventory swaps and options are entered into with the intent of managing seasonally high concentrations of MBM, PM, BFT, PG, YG and BBP inventories by reducing the potential impact of changing prices.Corn options and future contracts are entered into with the intent of managing forecasted sales of BBP by reducing the impact of changing prices.  Foreign currency forward contracts are entered into to mitigate the foreign exchange rate risk for transactions designated in a currency other than the Company reporting currency. Entities are required to report all derivative instruments in the statement of financial position at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value i.e., gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, on the reason for holding the instrument. If certain conditions are met, entities may elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures to changes in fair value, cash flows or foreign currencies.If the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income outside of earnings and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Any amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness as well as the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately. If the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change. Hedge accounting treatment ceases if or when the hedge transaction is no longer probable of occurring or the hedge relationship correlation no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.At December28, 2013, the Company had natural gas swaps and corn options outstanding that qualified and were designated for hedge accounting as well as heating oil swaps and foreign currency forward contracts that did not qualify and were not designated for hedge accounting16Revenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes revenue on sales when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss. Certain customers may be required to prepay prior to shipment in order to maintain payment protection against certain foreign and domestic sales. These amounts are recorded as unearned revenue and revenue is recognized when the products have shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss. The Company has formula arrangements with certain suppliers whereby the charge or credit for raw materials is tied to published finished product commodity prices after deducting a fixed processing fee incorporated into the formula and is recorded as a cost of sale by line of business. The Company recognizes revenue related to grease trap servicing and industrial residual removal in the fiscal month the trap service or industrial residual removal occurs17Related Party TransactionsThe Company announced on January21, 2011 that a wholly-owned subsidiary of Darling entered into a limited liability company agreement with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation Valero to form Diamond Green Diesel Holdings LLC the DGD Joint Venture. The Company has related party sale transactions with the DGD Joint Venture. Additionally, Darling through its wholly-owned subsidiary Griffin Industry LLC Griffin, leases two real properties located in Butler, Kentucky and real properties located in each of Jackson, Mississippi and Henderson, Kentucky from Martom Properties, LLC, an entity owned in part by Martin W. Griffin, the Companys Executive Vice President Chief Operations Officer, North America. See Note 10 and Note 23 for further information on the Company related party transactions.Page 88DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued18Foreign Currency Translation and RemeasurementForeign currency translation is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reflects the adjustments resulting from translating the foreign currency denominated financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. The functional currency of the Company foreign subsidiaries is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates, which is generally the local currency of the country. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars at fiscal year end exchange rates. Income and expense items are translated at daily or average monthly exchange rates. Changes in exchange rates that affect cash flows and the related receivables or payables are recognized as transaction gains and losses in determining net income. The Company incurred net foreign currency translation losses of approximately $145 millionin fiscal year 2013 and nocurrency translation in fiscal years 2012 and 2011. In addition, the Company incurred foreign currency gains in the statement of operations of approximately $281 millionin fiscal 2013 with $275 millionrepresenting an unrealized gain on a hedge transaction, which is included in other assets on the balance  prior year immaterial amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation20Subsequent EventsThe Company evaluates subsequent events from the end of the most recent fiscal year through the date the consolidated financial statements are issued.NOTE 2.ACQUISITIONSOn October28, 2013, Darling completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Rothsay for approximately CAD $6402 millionapproximately USD$6126 millionat the exchange rate of CAD$100:USD$09569 comprised of cash of CAD$6445 millionless a contingent receivable of approximately CAD$43 milliondue to over payment for working capital, which was returned by MFI in fiscal 2014. The cash portion of the Rothsay Acquisiton was funded through a combination of borrowings under Darling senior secured revolving credit facility and term loan facility.

Under the Director Restricted Stock Plan, $60,000in restricted Company common stock the Restricted Stock will be awarded to each non-employee director on the fourth business day after the Company releases its earnings for its prior completed fiscal year the Date of Award.The amount of restricted stock to be issued will be calculated using the closing price of the Companys common stock on the third business day after the Company releases its earnings.The Restricted Stock will be subject to a right of repurchase at $001per share upon termination of the holder as a member of the Company board of directors for cause and will not be transferable. These restrictions will lapse with respect to 100%of the Restricted Stock upon the earliest to occur of i tenyears after the Date of Award, ii a Change of Control as defined in the 2004 Omnibus Plan, and iii termination of the non-employee director service with the Company, other than for cause as defined in the Director Restricted Stock Plan.On March 5, 2013, the Company issued 21,780shares of restricted stock in the aggregate to its non-employee directors under the Director Restricted Stock Plan.

The amount of restricted stock and stock options to be issued was predetermined using a discounted per share price. The Discounted Per Share Price is derived by discounting the closing market price of the Company common stock as of the last trading day of thePage 108DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedimmediately preceding fiscal year to account for forfeiture of the restricted stock based on, among other things, the probability of the failure of the restricted stock to be granted and the failure of the Company to meet the required performance measures. The stock options will have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company common stock on the third business day after the Company releases its annual financial results.The above 2013 Restricted Stock and Option Awards were deemed equity classified in fiscal 2013as the shares are known, but have not yet been granted. In addition, a portion of the fiscal 2013LTIP stock awards are treated as a liability until the grant date when the number of shares to be issued is known, and then it becomes equity classified. At December28, 2013, the Company recorded a liability of approximately $03 millionon the balance sheet for the long-term incentive opportunities2010 Special Incentive Program Awards. On November11, 2010, the Committee approved a 2010 Special Incentive Program the 2010 Special Incentive Program for certain key employees of the Company pursuant to the Company 2004 Omnibus Plan, conditioned upon the closing of the Griffin merger.Under the 2010 Special Incentive Program, certain key employees the Participating Employees upon successful completion of the Griffin merger became eligible to receive a total of 640,000shares of restricted stock of which 548,331shares have been issued and 6,667shares have been forfeited as of December28, 2013.The stock vests upon the closing of the Griffin merger and achievement of certain varying market conditions over vesting periods spanning 4years.A Participating Employee will not be entitled to receive any grant under these restricted stock awards if such Participating Employees employment with the Company has terminated, voluntarily or involuntarily, prior to the determination that the conditions to receive such restricted stock award have been fulfilled.NOTE 15.COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEThe Company follows FASB authoritative guidance for reporting and presentation of comprehensive income or loss and its components. Other comprehensive income loss is derived from adjustments that reflect pension adjustments, natural gas derivative adjustments, corn option adjustments, foreign currency translation adjustments and interest rate swap derivative adjustments.

Defined benefits are based principally on length of service and earnings patterns during the five years preceding retirement. During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, as part of the initiative to combine the Darling and Griffin retirement benefit programs, the Company Board of Directors authorized the Company to proceed with the restructuring of its retirement benefit program effective January1, 2012, to include the closing of Darling salaried and hourly defined benefit plans to new participants as well as the freezing of service and wage accruals thereunder effective December31, 2011 a curtailment of these plans for financial reporting purposes and the enhancing of benefits under the Company defined contribution plans. Several locations of the Company-sponsored hourly union plan have been curtailed as a result of collective bargaining renewals for those sites.Page 111DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedEffective January1, 2012, the Griffin hourly 401k plan merged into the Darling International Inc. Hourly 401k Savings Plan.Effective January1, 2012, all of the Companys hourly employees are eligible to participate in this plan, which allows for elective deferrals, an employer match equal to 25%up to 6%of a participants deferrals each pay period and an employer contribution based on age ranging from 2-5%of compensation per year. Previously, the Company employer match was equal to 100%of the first $10per pay period deferred by a participant, with a maximum of $520per year, and an employer contribution equal to $520per year.Effective January1, 2012, Darling International Inc. Hourly 401k Savings Plan accepted the transfer of assets and liabilities of the hourly employees of Griffin that had account balances in the Griffin plans which existed prior to January1, 2012. In addition, effective January1, 2012, the Griffin salaried 401k plan merged into the Darling International Inc. Salaried 401k Savings Plan, a defined contribution plan, which was amended and now includes an employer match equal to 25%up to 6%of a participants deferrals each pay period and an employer contribution based on age ranging from 3-6%of compensation per year. Previously, the Darling International Inc. Salaried 401k Savings Plan included an employer contribution based on age ranging from 2-5%of compensation per year.Effective January1, 2012, Darling International Inc. Salaried 401k Savings Plan accepted the transfer of assets and liabilities of the salaried employees of Griffin that had account balances in the Griffin plans which existed prior to January1, 2012.The Company matching portion and annual employer contribution to the Darling International Inc. Hourly 401k Savings and Darling International Inc. Salaried 401k Savings Plans for the fiscal 2013, 2012and 2011was approximately $82 million, $72 millionand $22 million, respectively.Under Griffin old defined contribution plans the Company made matching contributions for fiscal 2011 of approximately $05 million.As a result of the Rothsay Acquisition, certain employees of MFI became employees of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, the pension benefits of these employees in respect to service prior to October 28, 2013 remain the responsibility of MFI. Benefits and rights accruing to these employees on and after October 28, 2013 including earning increases on benefits accrued for non-Quebec employees prior to October 28, 2013 are the responsibility of the Company. The three plans created with an initial date of October 28, 2013 are the Darling International Canada Inc. Pension Plan for Eligible Salaried and Hourly Non-Union Employees the DICI Non-Union Plan; the Darling International Canada Inc. Pension Plan for Eligible Unionized Employees; and the Darling Supplemental Employees Retirement Plan. In addition, the DICI Non-Union Plan includes a defined contribution component. In fiscal 2013, Rothsay made employer contributions of approximately $01 million.The Company recognizes the over-funded or under-funded status of the Company defined benefit post-retirement plans as an asset or liability in the Company balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur. The following table sets forth the plans funded status for the Company domestic and foreign defined benefit plans and amounts recognized in the Company consolidated balance sheets based on the measurement date December28, 2013and December29, 2012 in thousands:Page 112DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedDecember 28,2013December 29,2012Change in projected benefit obligation:Projected benefit obligation at beginning of  cost507326Interest cost5,3075,451Employee contributions20Actuarial loss12,90413,084Benefits  benefit obligation at end of period129,966137,797Change in plan assets:Fair value of plan assets at beginning of period106,51996,235Actual return on plan assets13,14713,026Employer  contributions20Benefits paid4,7614,617Fair value of plan assets at end of period118,898106,519Funded status11,06831,278Net amount  recognized in the consolidated balancesheets consist of:Non-current assets$29$Non-current liability11,09731,278Net amount  recognized in accumulated othercomprehensive loss consist of:Net actuarial loss$26,738$50,714Prior service cost32174Net amount  do not include deferred taxes of $104 millionand $194 millionat December28, 2013and December29, 2012, respectively.The amounts included in Other in the above table reflect the impact of foreign exchange translation for plans in Canada. The Company domestic pension plan benefits comprise approximately 97%of the projected benefit obligation. Additionally, the Company has made required and tax deductible discretionary contributions to its U.S. pension plans in Fiscal 2013and Fiscal 2012of approximately $40 millionand $19 million, respectively. All of these contributions were made to the domestic plans.December 28,2013December 29,2012Projected benefit  benefit obligation125,939137,797Fair value of plan assets118,898106,519Page 113DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedNet pension cost includes the following components in thousands:December 28,2013December 29,2012December 31,2011Service cost$507$326$1,178Interest cost5,3075,4516,052Expected return on plan  amortization and  pension cost$3,881$3,927$3,219Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the year ended in thousands:20132012Actuarial loss/gain recognized:Reclassification  loss/gain recognized during the period11,8694,145Prior service cost credit recognized:Reclassification adjustments8764Prior service cost arising during the period$15,140$1,169The estimated amount that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost in fiscal 2014is as follows in thousands:2014Net actuarial loss$2,078Prior service cost16$2,094Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations were:December 28,2013December 29,2012December 31,2011Discount rate466%390%450%Rate of compensation increase300 Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the employee benefit pension plans were:December 28,2013December 29,2012December 31,2011Discount rate396%450%555%Rate of increase in future compensation levels%%416%Expected long-term rate of return on assets735%735%785%Page 114DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedConsideration was made to the long-term time horizon for the plans' benefit obligations as well as the related asset class mix in determining the expected long-term rate of return.Historical returns are also considered, over the long-term time horizon, in determining the expected return.Considering the overall asset mix of approximately 60%equity and 40%fixed income, several years in the last tenyears except for 2008 having strong double digit returns as well as several years of single digit losses, the Company believes it is reasonable to expect a long-term rate of return of 735%for the plans' investments as a whole.Plan AssetsThe Company pension plan weighted-average asset allocations at December28, 2013and December29, 2012, by asset category, are as follows:Plan Assets atAsset CategoryDecember 28, 2013December 29, 2012Equity Securities517%613%Debt  initial allocation of the Darling Canada pension plans will be invested in a diversified mix of global and Canadian equity and fixed income instruments. The presumed allocation will approximate the percentages below:Canada equity30%Global equity30%Canadian fixed income35%Cash5%The investment objectives have been established in conjunction with a comprehensive review of the current and projected financial requirements.The primary investment objectives are:1 to have the ability to pay all benefit and expense obligations when due; 2 to maximize investment returns within reasonable and prudent levels of risk in order to minimize contributions; and 3 to maintain flexibility in determining the future level of contributions.Investment results are the most critical element in achieving funding objectives, while reliance on contributions is a secondary element.The investment guidelines are based upon an investment horizon of greater than ten years; therefore, interim fluctuations are viewed with this perspective.The strategic asset allocation is based on this long-term perspective and the plans' funded status.However, because the participants average age is somewhat older than the typical average plan age, consideration is given to retaining some short-term liquidity.Analysis of the cash flow projections of the plans indicates that benefit payments will continue to exceed contributions.The results of a thorough asset-liability study completed during 2012 established a dynamic asset allocation glide path the Glide Path by which the plans' asset allocations are determined. The Glide Path designates intervals based on funded status which contain a corresponding allocation to equities/real assets and fixed income. As the plans' funded status improves, the allocations become more conservative, and the opposite is true when the funded status declines.Based upon the plans funded status, time horizon, risk tolerances, performance expectations, asset class constraints and asset-liability study results, target asset allocation ranges are as follows:Fixed Income35% - 80%Equities20% - 65%The fixed income allocation is primarily invested in corporate and government bonds denominated in U.S. dollar, private and publicly traded mortgages, private placement debt and cash equivalents.The average duration of the issues is managed to closely match the duration of the plans' liabilities. The portfolio is expected to be well-diversified.Page 115DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedThe domestic equity allocation is invested in stocks traded on one of the U.S. stock exchanges.Securities convertible into such stocks, convertible bonds and preferred stock, may also be purchased.The majority of the domestic equities are invested in mutual funds that are well-diversified among growth and value stocks categorized in large, mid and small cap asset classes.By definition, small cap investments carry greater risk than large and mid cap, but also are expected to create greater returns over time than large and mid cap.By definition large cap investments carry less risk than small and mid cap, and are expected to return less than small and mid cap over time.By definition mid cap investments fall between small and large cap stocks concerning riskiness and expected return.Small company definitions fluctuate with market levels but generally will be considered companies with market capitalizations between $300 millionand $2 billion.The portfolio will be diversified in terms of individual company securities and industries.No individual equity or individual fixed income investment comprised more than 15%of the defined benefit plans' total assets excluding U.S. government issues.The international equity allocation is invested in companies whose stock is traded outside the U.S. and/or companies that conduct the major portion of their business outside of the U.S.The portfolio may invest in ADR.The emerging market portion of the international equity investment is held below 10%due to greater volatility in the asset class.The portfolio is well-diversified in terms of companies, industries and countries.The diversified asset portion of the allocation will invest in securities with a goal to outpace inflation and preserve their value. The securities in this allocation may consist of inflation-indexed bonds, securities of real estate companies, commodity index-linked notes, fixed-income securities, securities of natural resource companies, master limited partnerships, publicly-listed infrastructure companies, and floating rate debt.All investment objectives are expected to be achieved over a market cycle anticipated to be a period of five to seven years.Reallocations are performed on a monthly basis to retain target allocation ranges. On a quarterly basis the plans' funded status will be recalculated to determine which Glide Path interval allocation is appropriate.The following table presents fair value measurements for the Company defined benefit plans assets as categorized using the fair value hierarchy under FASB authoritative guidance in thousands:TotalQuoted Prices inActive Markets forIdentical AssetsSignificant  thousands of dollarsFair ValueLevel 1Level 2Level 3Balances asDecember 29, 2012Fixed Income:Long  Term954542412Equity Securities:Domestic   as December 28, 2013Fixed Income:Long  Term771771Equity Securities:Domestic   fiscal 2010 the Company increased its pension investment options allowing for investing directly into mutual funds whereby the Company believes it gives the pension plan assets more options and a greater long term return potential. As a result the Company has transferred its pension assets in fiscal 2010 from pooled separate accountsPage 116DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedPSA accounts to assets comprised primarily of mutual funds, which are publicly traded in an active market. The particular shares used in the defined benefit plans are either retirement plan shares or A-shares with no loads.The fair value of each mutual fund is based on the market value of the underlying investments. In fiscal 2013, the Glide Path directed the Company to invest in certain PSA in an effort to minimize the plans' funded status variability as compared to fiscal 2012.ContributionsThe Company funding policy for employee benefit pension plans is to contribute annually not less than the minimum amount required nor more than the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes.Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future.Based on current actuarial estimates, the Company expects to make payments of approximately $20 millionto meet funding requirements for its pension plans in fiscal 2014.Estimated Future Benefit PaymentsThe following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid in thousands:Year EndingPension  2019 202339,800Multiemployer Pension PlansThe Company participates in various multiemployer pension plans which provide defined benefits to certain employees covered by labor contracts.These plans are not administered by the Company and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants.The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued guidance requiring companies to provide additional disclosures related to individually significant multiemployer pension plans. The Company contributions to each individual multiemployer plan represent less than 5% of the total contributions to each such plan. Based on the most currently available information, the Company has determined that, if a withdrawal were to occur, withdrawal liabilities on twoof the plans in which the Company currently participates could be material to the Company.

Certain of these agreements have expired and are being renegotiated with others having expiration dates through May 31, 2016.c The Company has several processing plants that participate in the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan under collective bargaining agreements that require minimum funding contributions. Certain of these agreements have expired and are being renegotiated with others having expiration dates through April 30, 2016.With respect to the other multiemployer pension plans in which the Company participates and which are not individually significant, fourplans have certified as critical or red zone, threeplan has certified as endangered or yellow zone as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006.  The Company portion of contributions to all plans amounted to $31 million, $32 millionand $31 millionfor the years ended December28, 2013, December29, 2012and December31, 2011, respectively. In June 2009, the Company received a notice of a mass withdrawal termination and a notice of initial withdrawal liability from a multiemployer plan in which it participated.The Company had anticipated this event and as a result had accrued approximately $32 millionas of January 3, 2009 based on the most recent information that was probable and estimable for this plan.The plan had given a notice of redetermination liability in December 2009.In fiscal 2010, the Company received further third party information confirming the future payout related to this multiemployer plan.As a result, the Company reduced its liability to approximately $12 million.In fiscal 2010, another underfunded multiemployer plan in which the Company participates gave notification of partial withdrawal liability.As of December28, 2013, the Company has an accrued liability of approximately $09 millionrepresenting the present value of scheduled withdrawal liability payments under this multiemployer plan.While the Company has no ability to calculate a possible current liability for under-funded multiemployer plans that could terminate or could requireadditional funding under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the amounts could be material.NOTE 17.DERIVATIVESThe Companys operations are exposed to market risks relating to commodity prices that affect the Companys cost of raw materials, finished product prices and energy costs and the risk of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.The Company makes limited use of derivative instruments to manage cash flow risks related to interest expense, natural gas usage, diesel fuel usage, inventory, forecasted sales and foreign currency exchange rates.The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes.Interest rate swaps are entered into with the intent of managing overall borrowing costs by reducing the potential impact of increases in interest rates on floating-rate long-term debt.Natural gas swaps and options are entered into with the intent of managing the overall cost of natural gas usage by reducing the potential impact of seasonal weather demands on natural gas that increases natural gas prices.Heating oil swaps and options are entered into with the intent of managing the overall cost of diesel fuel usage by reducing the potential impact of seasonal weather demands on diesel fuel that increases diesel fuel prices.Corn options and future contracts are entered into with the intent of managing forecasted sales of BBP by reducing the impact of changing prices. Foreign currency forward contracts are entered into to mitigate the foreign exchange rate risk for transactions designated in a currency other than the Company reporting currency. At December28, 2013, the Company had natural gas swaps and corn options outstanding that qualified and were designated for hedge accounting as well as natural gas swaps, heating oil swaps and foreign currency forward contracts that did not qualify and were not designated for hedge accounting. Entities are required to report all derivative instruments in the statement of financial position at fair value.The accounting for changes in the fair value i.e., gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, on the reason for holding the instrument.If certain conditions are met, entities may elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures to changes in fair value, cash flows or foreign currencies.If the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income outside of earnings and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings.Any amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness as well as the ineffective portion of the gain or loss are reported in earnings immediately.If the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change.Page 118DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedIn November 2013, the Company entered into foreign currency exchange forward contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting to mitigate the foreign exchange rate risk of the expected acquisition price of the VION Acquisition. Under the terms of the exchange contracts,the Company exchanged U.S. dollars for 10 billionat a fixed weighted average price of approximately1346with a maturity date of early January 2014. The foreign currency contract was not designated for hedge accounting. At December28, 2013, the Company recorded an other current asset of approximately $275 millionon the balance sheet and recorded an unrealized gain of $275 millionin the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Cash Flow HedgesOn May19, 2006, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements that were considered cash flow hedges according to FASB authoritative guidance. In December 2010, as a result of the Merger and entry into a new Credit Agreement the term loan that specifically related to these interest swap transactions was repaid. As such, the Company discontinued the interest rate swaps and paid approximately $20 millionrepresenting the fair value of these two interest swap transactions at the discontinuance date with the effective portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss to be reclassified to income over the remaining original term of the interest rate swaps which ended April7, 2012.In fiscal 2012and fiscal 2013, the Company has entered into natural gas swap contracts that are considered cash flow hedges.Under the terms of the natural gas swap contracts the Company fixed the expected purchase cost of a portion of its plants expected natural gas usage into the first quarter of fiscal 2014.As of December28, 2013, all of the fiscal 2012contracts and some of fiscal 2013contracts have expired and settled according to the contracts while the remaining contract positions and activity are disclosed below.In fiscal 2012and fiscal 2013, the Company entered into corn option contracts that are considered cash flow hedges. Under the terms of the corn option contracts the Company hedged a portion of it forecasted sales of BBP into the third quarter of fiscal 2014. As of December28, 2013, all fiscal 2012contracts and some of the fiscal 2013contracts have settled while the remaining contract positions and activity are disclosed below. From time to time, the Company may enter into corn option contracts in the future.The Company estimates the amount that will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive gain at December28, 2013into earnings over the next 12months will be approximately $24 million.As of December28, 2013, noamounts have been reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow

MEASUREMENTFASB authoritative guidancewhich defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements including guidance related to nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities.The following table presents the Company financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis as of December28, 2013and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy under FASB authoritative guidance.The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine the fair value.Fair Value Measurements at December 28, 2013 UsingQuoted Prices inActive Markets forIdentical AssetsSignificant  thousands of dollarsTotalLevel 1Level 2Level 3AssetsDerivative

represents the difference between the observable market rates of commonly quoted intervals for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and the fixed swap and option rate considering the instruments term, notional amount and credit risk.See Note 17 Derivatives for breakdown by instrument type.Derivative liabilities consist of the Company natural gas swap contracts, heating oil swap contracts and corn option and futures, which represent the difference between the observable market rates of commonly quoted intervals for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and the fixed swap rate considering the instruments term, notional amount and credit risk.See Note 17 Derivatives for breakdown by instrument type.The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments and as such have been excluded from the table above. The carrying amount for the Company other debt is not deemed to be significantly different than the fair value and all other instruments have been recorded at fair value.The fair value of the senior notes is based on market quotation from a third-party bank.NOTE 19.CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKConcentration of credit risk is limited due to the Company diversified customer base and the fact that the Company sells commodities.Nosingle customer accounted for more than 10%of the Companys net sales in fiscal years 2013, 2012and 2011.NOTE 20.CONTINGENCIESThe Company is a party to several lawsuits, claims and loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of its business, including assertions by certain regulatory and governmental agencies related to permitting requirements and air, wastewater and storm water discharges from the Company processing facilities.The Companys workers compensation, auto and general liability policies contain significant deductibles or self-insured retentions.The Company estimates and accrues its expected ultimate claim costs related to accidents occurring during each fiscal year and carries this accrual as a reserve until these claims are paid by the Company.Page 121DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedAs a result of the matters discussed above, the Company has established loss reserves for insurance, environmental and litigation matters.At December28, 2013and December29, 2012, the reserves for insurance, environmental and litigation contingencies reflected on the balance sheet in accrued expenses and other non-current liabilities were approximately $355 millionand $370 million, respectively.The Company has insurance recovery receivables of approximately $88 millionand $93 million, as of December28, 2013and December29, 2012, respectively, related to these liabilities. The Company management believes these reserves for contingencies are reasonable and sufficient based upon present governmental regulations and information currently available to management; however, there can be no assurance that final costs related to these matters will not exceed current estimates.The Company believes that the likelihood is remote that any additional liability from these lawsuits and claims that may not be covered by insurance would have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Lower Passaic River Area. The Company has been named as a third party defendant in a lawsuit pending in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Essex County, styled New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, The Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Agency and the Administrator of the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund, as Plaintiffs, vs. Occidental Chemical Corporation, Tierra Solutions, Inc., Maxus Energy Corporation, Repsol YPF, S.A., YPF, S.A., YPF Holdings, Inc., and CLH Holdings, as Defendants Docket No. L-009868-05 the Tierra/Maxus Litigation. In the Tierra/Maxus Litigation, which was filed on December13, 2005, the plaintiffs seek to recover from the defendants past and future cleanup and removal costs, as well as unspecified economic damages, punitive damages, penalties and a variety of other forms of relief, purportedly arising from the alleged discharges into the Passaic River of a particular type of dioxin and other unspecified hazardous substances. The damages being sought by the plaintiffs from the defendants are likely to be substantial. On February4, 2009, twoof the defendants, Tierra Solutions, Inc. Tierra and Maxus Energy Corporation Maxus, filed a third party complaint against over 300entities, including the Company, seeking to recover all or a proportionate share of cleanup and removal costs, damages or other loss or harm, if any, for which Tierra or Maxus may be held liable in the Tierra/Maxus Litigation. Tierra and Maxus allege that Standard Tallow Company, an entity that the Company acquired in 1996, contributed to the discharge of the hazardous substances that are the subject of this case while operating a former plant site located in Newark, New Jersey. The Company is a party to a settlement in this matter pursuant to which it will pay the State of New Jersey $195,000and be dismissed from the case. This amount was accrued in the first quarter of 2013. The Superior Court approved the settlement on December 12, 2013 and entered an order dismissing participating third-party defendants from the litigation. We have paid our settlement amount into escrow where it will be held by the Superior Court pending any appeal of the Superior Courts order. Additionally, in December 2009, the Company, along with numerous other entities, received notice from the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA that the Company as successor-in-interest to Standard Tallow Company is considered a potentially responsible party with respect to alleged contamination in the lower Passaic River area which is part of the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site located in Newark, New Jersey. In the letter, the EPA requested that the Company join a group of other parties in funding a remedial investigation and feasibility study at the site. As of the date of this report, the Company has not agreed to participate in the funding group. The Company ultimate liability for investigatory costs, remedial costs and/or natural resource damages in connection with the lower Passaic River area cannot be determined at this time; however, as of the date of this report, there is nothing that leads the Company to believe that these matters will have a material effect on the Company financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Fresno Facility Permit Issue.The Company has been named as a defendant and a real party in interest in a lawsuit filed on April 9, 2012 in the Superior Court of the State of California, Fresno County, styled Concerned Citizens of West Fresno vs. Darling International Inc.The complaint, as subsequently amended, alleges that the Company Fresno facility is operating without a proper use permit and seeks, among other things, injunctive relief. The complaint had at one time also alleged that the Company Fresno facility constitutes a continuing private and public nuisance, but the plaintiff has since amended the complaint to drop these allegations. The City of Fresno was also named as a defendant in the original complaint but has since had a judgment entered in its favor and is no longer a defendant in the lawsuit; however, in December 2013 the City of Fresno filed a motion to intervene as a plaintiff in this matter. The Superior Court heard the motion on February 4, 2014, and entered an order on February 18, 2014 denying the motion. Rendering operations have been conducted on the site since 1955, and the Company believes that it possesses all of the required federal, state and local permits to continue to operate the facility in the manner currently conducted and that its operations do not constitute a private or public nuisance. Accordingly, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter. Discovery has begun and this matter is currently scheduled for trial in July 2014. While management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the Company financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Page 122DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedNOTE 21.BUSINESS SEGMENTSEffective January2, 2011, as a result of the acquisition of Griffin, the Company business operations were reorganized into twonew segments, Rendering and Bakery, in order to better align its business with the underlying markets and customers that the Company serves.

Reclassification adjustments between net income and other comprehensive income must be shown on the face of the statements, with no resulting change in net earnings. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12, Deferral of Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05. This ASU amends ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income. The new standard deferred the requirement to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income while the FASB further deliberates this aspect of the proposal. This update is effective for the Company on January1, 2012 and must be applied retrospectively. The Company adopted this standard as of March 31, 2012. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This ASU amends ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income. This new standard requires an entity to report either on the income statement or disclose in the footnotes to the financial statement the effects on earnings from items that are reclassified out of other comprehensive income. This update was effective for the Company on December 30, 2012. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements.In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2012-02, Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment. The ASU amends ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.  The new standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of performing an impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The new standard allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If based on its qualitative assessment an entity concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, quantitative impairment testing is required.  However, if an entity concludes otherwise, quantitative impairment testing is not required. The standards update is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements.In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists. The ASU amends ASC Topic 740, Income TaxesThe new standard requires, unless certain conditions exist, an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented as a reduction to a deferred tax asset in the financial statements for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. The standard will become effective for the Company prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2013, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. Retrospective application is also permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, the adoption of ASU 2013-11 will have on the Company consolidated financial statements.Page 126DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedNOTE 25.GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATIONThe Company 85%Notes see Note 11 are guaranteed on an unsecured basis by the Company 100%directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries Darling National, Griffin and its subsidiary Craig Protein, Darling AWS LLC, Terra Holding Company, Darling Global Holdings Inc., Darling Northstar LLC, Terra Renewal Services, Inc. and EV Acquisition, Inc. collectively, the 85% Note Guarantors.

required by Rule 13a-15b under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act, the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures.As defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act, disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures of the Company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms.Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Based on managements evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.Internal Control over Financial Reporting.aManagements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f promulgated under the Exchange Act.Those rules define internal control over financial reporting as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; andProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December28, 2013. In making this assessment, the Company management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO 1992.Based on their assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December28, 2013.In August 2013 and October 2013, the Company acquired TRS and Rothsay, respectively. The Company is currently in the process of integrating both TRS and Rothsay pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Company is evaluating changes to processes, information technology systems and other components of internal controls over financial reporting as part of its ongoing integration activities, and as a result, controls will be periodically changed. The Company believes, however, it will be Page 135able to maintain sufficient controls over the substantive results of its financial reporting throughout this integration process.
