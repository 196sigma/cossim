America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.The Company management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, appearing under Item 9Ab.Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated
audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

a development stage enterprise NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 The Company and Significant Accounting Policies Description of the Company We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company and operate in one reportable segment which is focused on discovering and developing innovative small-molecule drugs for the treatment of cancer and immune-mediated diseases.Our mission and goal is to build a viable biopharmaceutical company that commercializes novel therapies intended to improve quality of life, increase duration of life and resolve serious unmet medical healthcare needs.We identify promising product candidates using our scientific development expertise, develop our products in a rapid, cost-efficient manner and pursue commercialization and/or development partners when and where appropriate. To date, substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to the research and development of our products, and we have not generated any commercial revenues from the sale of our products.We do not anticipate the generation of any product commercial revenues until we receive the necessary regulatory and marketing approvals to launch one of our products. We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in 1991, and as of June 30, 2011, had an accumulated deficit of $413,125,000.Based upon the current status of our product development and plans, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs through at least the next twelve months. We expect research and development expenses, as a result of on-going and future clinical trials, to consume a large portion of our existing cash resources.Changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may affect actual future consumption of existing cash resources as
well.In any event, we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations in the future.Our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the following  our ability to establish and the scope of any new partnership collaborations  the progress and success of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates; and  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially.The factors described above will impact our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds.If we are required to raise additional funds, we cannot be certain that such additional funding will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all.Furthermore, any additional equity financing may be highly dilutive, or otherwise disadvantageous, to existing stockholders and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive
covenants.Collaborative arrangements, if necessary to raise additional funds, may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, products or marketing territories.Our failure to raise capital when needed and on acceptable terms, would require us to reduce our operating expenses and would limit our ability to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements, to develop our product candidates, and to continue operations, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Basis of presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pharmacyclics, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pharmacyclics Europe Limited.There has been no significant financial activity to date related to the subsidiary.All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.The U.S. dollar is our functional currency for all of our consolidated operations.  64 Table of Contents Reclassification Certain immaterial prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Management use of estimates and assumptions The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Basic and diluted net loss per share Basic and diluted net loss per share are computed by dividing our net loss for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted net loss per share excludes potential common stock because their effect is antidilutive. Potential common shares consist of shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method. Options to purchase 6,858,198, 8,395,394 and 8,452,899 shares of common stock were outstanding at June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, but have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share because their effect was anti-dilutive. Cash and cash equivalents All highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity date of three months or less that are readily convertible into cash and have insignificant interest rate risk are considered to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities and fair value measurements Our marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale. We include these investments in current assets and carry them at fair value.Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss.The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity.Such amortization is included in interest income.Gains and losses on securities sold are recorded based on the specific identification method and are included in interest expense and other income expense, net in the statement of operations. Management assesses whether declines in the fair value of marketable securities are other than temporary.If the decline is judged to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value and the amount of the write down is included in the statement of operations.In determining whether a decline is other than temporary, management considers various factors including the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in
market value. To date we have not recorded any impairment charges on marketable securities related to other-than-temporary declines in market value. The fair value of our financial assets and liabilities is determined by using three levels of input which are defined as follows Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  65 Table of Contents Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. In markets with infrequent transactions, we primarily utilize broker quotes for valuation of these securities. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. We utilize the market approach to measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. Restricted investments Under our lease agreement, we are required to maintain a $290,000 letter of credit as security for performance under the lease. The letter of credit is secured by a $290,000 certificate of deposit which is included in other assets at June 30, 2011 and 2010. Concentration of credit risk and other risks and uncertainties Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. We place our cash and cash equivalents with high-credit quality financial institutions and invest in debt instruments of financial institutions, corporations and government entities with strong credit ratings. Our management believes it has established guidelines relative to credit quality, diversification and maturities that maintain safety and liquidity.Accounts receivable at June 30, 2011 and 2010 represent amounts due from Servier associated with reimbursement of certain costs. Our products require approvals from the United States Food and Drug Administration the FDA and international regulatory agencies prior to commercial sales. There can be no assurance that our future products will receive required approvals. If we were denied such approvals or such approvals were delayed, it could have a materially adverse impact on us and the execution of our business strategy. We have expended and will continue to expend substantial funds to complete the research, development and clinical testing of our products. We also will be required to expend additional funds to establish commercial-scale manufacturing arrangements and to provide for the marketing and distribution of our products. Specifically, we will require additional funds to commercialize our products. We are unable to entirely fund these efforts with our current financial resources. Additional funds may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are unavailable on a timely basis from operations or additional sources of financing, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operations. Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years, or the lease term of the respective assets, if applicable. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or lease terms.  66 Table of Contents Long-lived assets Management reviews the carrying values of its long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in business conditions indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Management evaluates impairment on the basis of undiscounted future cash flows from operations before interest relating to such assets for the remaining useful life of the assets. If present, impairment is measured based on the difference between fair value and the net book value of the related assets.No significant impairment losses have been recorded to date with respect to our long-lived assets, which consist primarily of property and equipment and leasehold improvements. Revenue recognition We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met:persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the fee is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.Revenue under our license and collaboration arrangements is recognized based on the performance requirements of the contract. Amounts received under such arrangements consist of up-front collaboration payments, periodic milestone payments and payments for research activities. Our collaborations prior to July 1, 2010 with multiple elements were evaluated and divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria were met, including
whether the delivered element had stand-alone value and whether there was verifiable objective and reliable evidence VSOE of the fair value of the undelivered items.The consideration we received was combined and recognized as a single unit of accounting when criteria for separation were not met.Future collaborations with multiple elements will follow the separation criteria in Accounting Standards Update 2009-13 Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.Revenue will be allocated to each element using a selling price hierarchy, where the selling price for an element is based on VSOE if available; third-party evidence TPE, if available and VSOE is not available; or the best estimate of selling price, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Up-front payments under agreements which include future performance requirements are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized over the performance period. The performance period is estimated at the inception of the arrangement and is reevaluated at each reporting period. The reevaluation of the performance period may shorten or lengthen the period during which the deferred revenue is recognized. Revenues related to substantive, at-risk collaboration milestones are recognized upon achievement of the event specified in the underlying agreement. Revenues for research activities are recognized as the related research efforts are performed. Research and development Research and development expenses include personnel and facility-related expenses, outside contracted services including clinical trial costs, manufacturing and process development costs, research costs and other consulting services. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical development costs are a significant component of research and development expenses. We have a history of contracting with third parties that perform various clinical trial activities on our behalf in the ongoing development of our product candidates. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations and may vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flow. We accrue and expense costs for clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon estimates of the percentage of work completed over the life of the individual study in accordance with agreements established with contract research organizations and clinical trial sites. We determine our estimates through
discussions with internal clinical personnel and outside service providers to the progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services.  67 Table of Contents We have purchased quantities of drug substances that are expected to be used in the future to support our clinical development. Until the commercial viability of such products has been demonstrated and the necessary regulatory approvals received, we will continue to charge all such amounts to research and development expense. Income taxes We provide for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This method requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial statement reported amounts. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. Contingencies We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings. We may from time to time, however, become party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Fair value of financial instruments The carrying value of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Accounting for share-based compensation Share-based compensation cost for employee stock options is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award.The accounting grant date for employee stock options with performance obligations is the date on which the performance goals have been defined and a mutual understanding of the terms has been reached.Generally options with performance obligations vest over a four year period, with the goals set and agreed upon annually. Share-based compensation for non-employee stock options is re-estimated at each period-end through the vesting date. The fair value of each stock option is estimated using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility data of our stock. The expected term of stock options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of time that stock options are expected to be outstanding.The expected term for each of our employee options, non-employee options and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan is calculated for and applied to one group of grants as we do not expect substantially different exercise or post-vesting termination behavior among our employee or non-employee population.The risk-free interest rate is based on a zero-coupon United States Treasury
bond whose maturity period equals the expected term of the our options. Options vest upon the passage of time or a combination of time and the achievement of certain performance obligations.The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors will determine if the performance conditions have been met.Share-based compensation expense for the options with performance obligations is recorded when the company believes that the vesting of these options is probable. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In April 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2010-17, Revenue Recognition Milestone Method, which provides guidance on determining whether a milestone is substantive including the criteria that must be met for a milestone to be considered a substantive milestone and the recognition of consideration received upon achievement of a substantive milestone.ASU No. 2010-17 was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after June 15, 2010.We adopted this ASU on July 1, 2010 with no impact on our financial statements.  68 Table of Contents In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that modifies the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements.This guidance requires an entity to allocate revenue to each unit of accounting in multiple deliverable arrangements based on the relative selling price of each deliverable.It also changes the level of evidence of stand-alone selling prices required to separate deliverables by requiring an entity to make its best estimate of the stand-alone selling price of the deliverables when more objective evidence of selling price is not available.This guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2010.We adopted this guidance on
July 1, 2010 with no impact on our financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, which eliminates the presentation options currently in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 220 and requires the presentation of other comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.ASU No. 2011-05 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2011 and requires retrospective application.As this accounting standard only requires enhanced disclosure, the adoption of this standard will not impact our financial position or results of
operations. Note 2 Agreements Collaboration and License Agreement with Les Laboratoires Servier.In April 2009, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Les Laboratoires Servier Servier to research, develop and commercialize PCI-24781, an orally active, novel, small molecule inhibitor of pan-HDAC enzymes.Under the terms of the agreement, Servier acquired the exclusive right to develop and commercialize the pan-HDAC inhibitor product worldwide except for the United States and will pay a royalty to us on sales outside of the United States. Servier is solely responsible for
conducting and paying for all development activities outside the United States.We will continue to own all rights within the United States. In May 2009, we received an upfront payment of $11,000,000 $10,450,000 net of withholding taxes from Servier and we received an additional $4,000,000 for research collaboration paid over a twenty-four month period through April 2011. Our collaboration agreement with Servier is accounted for in accordance with accounting rules governing Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. The non-refundable upfront payment was deferred upon receipt and recognized on a straight-line basis over the two-year period ending on the anticipated date of completion of the research activities associated with the Research Program, which we believe represents the conclusion of all significant obligations on our part. Under the terms of the agreement, four company representatives are required to participate on a Joint Research and Development Committee JRDC. The JRDCs only responsibilities are to  Meet at least twice a year during the agreement term  Oversee the Research Program, Research Plan as defined and Development Plan as defined  Oversee the registration and commercialization of licensed products, and  Maintain a list of Option Compounds as defined existing prior to and identified during the Research Term. We believe that our involvement in the JRDC over the term required to complete the research activities associated with the Research Program represents a substantive performance obligation or deliverable.However, following completion of such research activities, participation on the JRDC represents only a right and a governance role, rather than a substantive performance obligation.  69 Table of Contents The deliverables under the collaboration did not meet criteria in the accounting rules for separation e.g., no separately identifiable fair value.Therefore, the arrangement has been treated as a single unit-of-accounting for purposes of revenue recognition. We recognized the combined unit of accounting over the estimated period required to complete the research activities under the collaboration two years, which coincides with the delivery period for all substantive obligations or deliverables associated with the collaboration. The collaboration and license agreement required us to enter into an agreement to supply drug product for Serviers use in clinical trials.During the quarter ending December 31, 2009, the supply agreement, which is considered part of the arrangement, was completed and executed.Prior to the execution of the supply agreement, we did not meet the evidence of an arrangement criterion required for revenue recognition and therefore had deferred revenue recognition until the execution of the supply agreement.Accordingly upon the execution of the drug supply agreement with Servier, we began recognizing revenue from our collaboration and license
agreement.Total revenue recognized in the year ended June 30, 2010 was $9,307,000, of which $1,211,000 represents the pro-rata portion of revenue attributable to the period from April 2009 i.e., the signing of the collaboration agreement to June 30, 2009, had the supply agreement been completed in April 2009.The remaining revenue associated with the initial $11,000,000 upfront payment and the $4,000,000 research collaboration payments was recognized in the year ended June 30, 2011.Of the $8,228,000 recognized from the Servier agreement for the year ended June 30, 2011, $4,355,000 represents amortization of the $11,000,000 upfront paymentand the remainder represents the pro-rata completion of services associated with research payments, our supply commitment and reimbursement of patent expenses. We also received a $7,000,000 advance development milestone payment in April 2011 which will be recognized as revenue when the related milestone has been reached and we could receive additional payments up to approximately $17,500,000 upon the achievement of certain future development and regulatory milestones, as well as royalty payments. Celera Corporation. In April 2006, we acquired multiple small molecule drug candidates for the treatment of cancer and other diseases from Celera Genomics, an Applera Corporation business now Celera Corporation a subsidiary of Quest Diagnostics Incorporated. Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired Celera technology and intellectual property relating to drugs that target histone deacetylase HDAC enzymes, selective HDAC enzymes, a Factor VIIa inhibitor targeting a tumor signaling pathway involved in angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastases, and B-cell associated tyrosine kinase inhibitors potentially useful for the treatment of lymphomas and
autoimmune diseases. At the date of acquisition, the HDAC drug candidate was in a Phase I clinical trial and the other drug candidates were in pre-clinical development. Future milestone payments to Celera under the agreement, as amended, could total as much as approximately $97,000,000, although we currently cannot predict if or when any of the milestones will be achieved.Approximately two-thirds of the milestone payments relate to our HDAC Inhibitor program and approximately one-third relates to our Factor VIIa program. Approximately 90% of the potential future milestone payments would be paid to Celera after obtaining regulatory approval in various countries.There are no milestone payments related to our Btk program.In addition to the milestone payments, Celera will be entitled to royalty payments based on annual sales of drugs commercialized from our HDAC
Inhibitor, Factor VIIa and certain Btk Inhibitor programs. In 2009 we paid Celera $1,000,000 in connection with an amendment to the agreement which changed the timeline of certain payments to Celera and also changed our obligation to pay royalties under certain conditions.The amount was recorded as research and development expense in 2009, as the technology rights were being utilized in research and development and it was not clear that an alternative future use existed for such technology.  70 Table of Contents University of Texas License. We have entered into a license agreement with the University of Texas in 1991 under which we received the exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize porphyrins, expanded porphyrins e.g. Motexafin Gadolinium and other porphyrin-like substances covered by their patents. In consideration for the license we paid a total of $300,000 and we are obligated to pay royalties based on net sales of products that utilize the licensed technology.

Duggan, our Chairman of the Board and CEO. The loans bore interest as follows: i 136% from December 30, 2008 until March 31, 2009, ii the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Citibank N.A. as its prime rate from April 1, 2009 until the loan was repaid. Total interest expense related to both loans was $43,000 for the year ended June 30, 2010 and $618,000 for the year ended June 30, 2009. In accordance with the terms of the loans, both loans plus accrued interest were settled in August 2009 by the issuance of 4,754,870 shares of common stock in our rights offering and the payment of $404,000 in cash. Note 6 Stockholders' Equity Deficit Common stock Registered Direct Offerings In June 2011, we sold approximately 64 million shares of our common stock to a group of institutional investors in a registered direct offering at $885 per share for net proceeds of approximately $56,039,000.In June 2010, we sold approximately 81 million shares to a group of institutional investors in a registered direct offering at $651 per share for net proceeds of approximately $50,800,000.Our Chairman and CEO, Robert W. Duggan, participated in the 2011 and 2010 offerings in the amounts of $6,000,000 and $7,000,000, respectively. Rights Offering On July 17, 2009, we commenced a rights offering pursuant to which holders of our common stock were entitled to purchase additional shares of our common stock at a price of $128 per share the Rights Offering. In the Rights Offering, stockholders of record as of July 15, 2009, were issued, at no charge, one subscription right for each share of common stock then outstanding.Each right entitled the holder to purchase 06808 share of our common stock for $128 per share.  73 Table of Contents Fractional shares were not issued in the Rights Offering. The subscription rights issued pursuant to the Rights Offering expired on July 31, 2009. Stockholders who exercised their rights in full were also permitted an oversubscription right to purchase additional shares of common stock that remained unsubscribed at the expiration of the Rights Offering, subject to the availability of shares and a pro rata allocation of shares among persons exercising the oversubscription right. As of the close of the Rights Offering on July 31, 2009, the Rights Offering was oversubscribed.The proration of available over-subscription shares was made in accordance with the Offering Prospectus.Approximately 225 million shares of our common stock were purchased in the Rights Offering for net proceeds after offering costs of approximately $1,000,000 and the partial settlement of loans from an affiliate of Robert W. Duggan, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, of approximately $6,100,000 of approximately $21,700,000.Mr. Duggan participated in the Rights Offering for a total of $6,100,000. Preferred stock As amended, our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $00001 per share. The Board of Directors is authorized to issue the preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any series or the designation of such series, without further vote or action by the stockholders.No preferred stock was outstanding at June 30, 2011 or June 30, 2010. The ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval may have certain anti-takeover effects. We are also subject to provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may make certain business combinations more difficult. Stock plans 2004 Equity Incentive Award Plan. In December 2004, stockholders approved the 2004 Equity Incentive Award Plan the 2004 Plan as a replacement for both our 1995 Stock Option Plan the 1995 Plan and the 1995 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan.At June 30, 2010, we had reserved 6,600,000 shares of our common stock for issuance under the plan.In December 2010, the stockholders approved an increase of 2,500,000 shares available for issuance under the plan. The 2004 Plan provides for the issuance of various types of equity awards, such as incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted
stock, stock appreciation rights and performance shares. The exercise price of all stock options granted under the 2004 Plan may not be less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and no stock option will be exercisable more than ten years after the date it is granted. Stock options for employees and consultants typically vest over four years. Non-employee Directors receive annual, automatic, non-discretionary grants of nonqualified stock options. Each new non-employee Director receives an option to purchase 10,000 shares as of the date he or she first becomes a Director. This option grant vests in equal annual installments over five years. In addition, on the date of each annual meeting, each individual re-elected as a non-employee Director will receive an automatic option grant to purchase an additional 7,500 shares of common stock, provided such
individual has served as a Director for at least six months prior to the date of grant. This option grant vests in equal monthly installments over twelve months following the date of grant. 1995 Stock Option Plan. Our 1995 Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in August 1995. Options issued under the 1995 Plan were, at the discretion of the plan administrator, either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. In December 2003, the stockholders approved amendments to the 1995 Plan i such that the exercise price of all stock options were required to be at least equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and ii increased the total number of authorized shares under the plan to 5,345,724 shares of common stock. Generally, shares subject to options under the 1995 Plan vest over a four or five year period and
are exercisable for a period of ten years. In December 2004, the remaining shares available for future grant under the 1995 Plan were transferred to the 2004 Plan. Additionally, if options granted under the 1995 Plan expire or otherwise terminate without being exercised, the shares of common stock reserved for such options again become available for future grant under the 2004 Plan.  74 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our stock option activity in thousands, except per share amounts  Options Outstanding  Number of Options Weighted Average

The fair value of each stock option is estimated using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility data of our stock. The expected term of stock options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of time that stock options are expected to be outstanding.The expected term for each of the types is calculated for and applied to one group of stock options as we do not expect substantially different exercise or post-vesting termination behavior among our employee population.The risk-free interest rate is based on a zero-coupon United States Treasury bond whose maturity period equals the expected term of the our
options.

The total pre-tax intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $10,385,000, $3,990,000 and $2,000, respectively. No income tax benefits were realized in the years ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Shares reserved for issuance and available for grant under the 2004 Plan were 3,714,137 shares as of June 30, 2011. As of June 30, 2011, $10,839,000 of total unrecognized compensation costs related to non vested employee options were scheduled to be recognized over a weighted average period of 286 years.As of June 30, 2011, unrecognized compensation cost of $2,228,000 related to non vested non-employee stock options was scheduled to be recognized over a weighted average period of 262 years.  77 Table of Contents A summary of outstanding, exercisable and vested stock options as of June 30, 2011 is as follows

3,649,445 426 22,684,000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan in August 1995. Qualified employees may elect to have a certain percentage of their salary withheld to purchase shares of our common stock under the Purchase Plan. The purchase price per share is equal to 85% of the fair market value of the stock on specified dates. Sales under the Purchase Plan in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 were 281,016, 61,026 and 35,035 shares of common stock at an average price of $206, $155 and $106 per share, respectively. Shares available for future purchase under the Purchase Plan were 136,530 at June 30, 2011. Compensation cost is estimated using the Black Scholes option-pricing model using the weighted average assumptions noted in the following table.  Year Ended June 30  2011 2010 2009 Expected dividend yield    Stock price volatility 52 105 144 Risk free interest rate 021 053 077 Expected life years 063 120 058 The weighted average estimated grant date fair value of purchase awards under our employee stock purchase plan during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $213, $409 and $073 per share, respectively. During fiscal 2010 a modification to our Purchase Plan went into effect that increased both the maximum employee contribution and the limit on the number of shares that could be purchased.As a result, a 17 of our employees chose to increase their contribution percentage which was accounted for as a modification to the terms of the award and resulted in $306,000 of additional compensation cost during the fiscal year. As of June 30, 2011, $186,000 of total unrecognized compensation costs related to purchase awards under our employee stock purchase plan were scheduled to be recognized over a weighted average period of 032 years.  78 Table of Contents Note 7 Employee Benefit Plan We maintain a defined contribution plan covering substantially all employees under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code. Our matching contribution to the plan was $104,000, $64,000 and $58,000 for the years ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $1,175,000 for the period from inception April 19, 1991 through June 30, 2011. Note 8 Income Taxes Deferred tax assets are summarized as follows in thousands  June 30  2011 2010 Net operating loss carryforwards 68,419 53,005 Tax credit carryforwards 9,857 8,755 Capitalized R D costs 3,784 3,553 Depreciation and amortization 2,457 2,670 Share-based compensation 3,117 3,107 Reserves and accruals 3,160 2,597 Gross deferred tax assets 90,794 73,687 Less valuation allowance 90,794 73,687 Net deferred tax assets A full valuation allowance has been established for our deferred tax assets at June 30, 2011 and 2010 since realization of such assets through the generation of future taxable income is uncertain. The increase decrease in the valuation allowance was approximately $17,107,000, $5,516,000 and $73,322,000 for the years ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The provision for income taxes differs from the amount determined by applying the United States statutory income tax rate to the loss before income taxes as summarized below in thousands  Year Ended June 30  2011 2010 2009 Tax benefit at statutory rate 14,023 6,204 9,121 Research and development credits 1,451 436 2,585 Deferred tax assets not benefited 14,611 6,136 10,269 Share-based compensation 1,096 488 308 Other 233 16 1,129 Withholding tax 550 550  550 550 The $550,000 tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2010 was the result of the reversal of the French withholding taxes related to our receipt of an $11,000,000 upfront payment from Servier in 2010.The withholding tax expense was no longer required as a result of a new treaty between the U.S. and France that was signed at the end of December 2009. At June 30, 2011, we had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $180,393,000 and $121,440,000, respectively. Approximately $7,400,000 of the federal net operating loss carry forwards relate to stock option deductions, the tax benefit of which will be accounted for directly to equity as additional paid in capital as they are utilized. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2012. Federal and state tax credit carry forwards of $4,771,000 and $9,635,000, respectively, are available to offset future taxable income. The federal tax credits will begin to expire in 2012. State research and development credits can be carried forward
indefinitely.  79 Table of Contents Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of and the benefit from net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards that can be carried forward may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than 50%, as defined, over a three year period. This annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization. We have determined that a cumulative stock ownership change happened and we have estimated that a significant portion of our net operating losses for federal and state tax purposes, as well as some amount of our federal research credits, will not be available for use in future
periods due to these limitation rules.The above estimated net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax assets reflect a reduction for the amounts we have estimated will expire unused. The following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits in thousands  Year Ended June 30  2011 2010 2009 Beginning balance 1,285 1,285 2,960 Additions based on tax positions related to current year 441 Additions reduction for tax positions of prior years 1,675 Settlements Lapse of applicable statute of limitations Ending balance 1,726 1,285 1,285 We may from time to time be assessed interest or penalties by major tax jurisdictions, although there have been no such assessments historically.In the event we receive an assessment for interest and/or penalties, it would be classified in the financial statements as income tax expense.As of June 30, 2011, all tax years in major jurisdictions remain open due to the taxing authorities ability to adjust operating loss carry forwards.We do not expect any material changes to the unrecognized tax benefits reported above during the next twelve months. During the year ended June 30, 2011, we were awarded a Therapeutic Discovery Project Tax Credit TDP under Section 48D of the Internal Revenue Code for each of our submitted programs PCI-32765 Btk Inhibitor, PCI-24781 HDAC Inhibitor and PCI-27483 Factor VIIa Inhibitor. We received the maximum available pro rata government allocation under TDP in the amount of $733,000.This is not taxable for federal income tax purposes; however, the net operating loss carry forward was reduced by the amount of grant money received. Note 9 Commitments In January 2011, we entered into an amendment of our facilities lease agreement which added an additional 32,256 square feet of leased space, giving us a total of 64,776 square feet.The amendment included an abatement of the monthly rent of the prior facility lease for the first 7 months, limited to $325,000, and a 12 month abatement for the added space, limited to $290,000. The amendment includes an option to extend the lease term for five years, an early termination fee of $2000 per sq. ft and a relocation option.The amended lease expires in November 2017.  80 Table of Contents We recognize rental expense under the lease on a straight line basis over the lease term. Differences between the straight line rent expense and rent payments are classified as deferred rent liability on the balance sheet. Future minimum lease payments under this non-cancelable operating lease are as follows in thousands  Operating Lease Commitments Less than 1 year 1-3 years 2,554 4-5 years 2,145 More than 5 years 1,609 Total 6,308 Rent expense for the years ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $776,000, $752,000 and $905,000, respectively, and $18,540,000 for the period from inception April 19, 1991 through June 30, 2011. Sublease income was $0 for each of the years ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, and $924,000 from the period from inception April 19, 1991 through June 30, 2011.

In October 2009, we entered into a separation agreement with Glenn Rice, our President and Chief Operating Officer.Under the agreement, Dr. Rice continued to provide services through February 2010 and vesting was accelerated on certain outstanding options.We recorded approximately $200,000 in additional share-based compensation expense related to this agreement in fiscal 2010. In September 2008, our President CEO Dr. Miller and our Vice President, Finance and Administration and CFO Mr. Lea, resigned their positions and entered into separation agreements with us.Under the separation agreements, the two executives continued to provide services through September 30, 2008 and October 31, 2008, respectively and we agreed to pay Dr. Miller and Mr. Lea one year of salary in severance payments, accelerate the vesting of all outstanding options, extend the exercise period of all outstanding options to three years after termination and provide healthcare benefits for twelve months following the termination of their employment.We recorded severance expense of
$536,000 and share-based compensation expense of $1,394,000 associated with the separation agreements in the year ended June 30, 2009.We also recorded severance expense of $600,000 including approximately $200,000 relating to cash-based severance payments and share-based compensation expense of approximately $400,000 in the year ended June 30, 2009 associated with Mr. Leas separation agreement.
