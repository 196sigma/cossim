NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Summary of Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements of BJ Wholesale Club, Inc. the
Company include the financial statements of all of the Company
subsidiaries, all of whose common stock is wholly owned by the Company.
Fiscal Year
The Company fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. The
fiscal years ended February 2, 2002 and January 29, 2000 included 52 weeks. The
fiscal year ended February 3, 2001 included 53 weeks.
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
The Company considers highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments with
maturities exceeding three months are classified as marketable securities.
Merchandise Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined under the average
cost method, or market. The Company recognizes the write-down of slow-moving or
obsolete inventory in cost of sales when such write-downs are probable and
estimable. The Company recognizes a reserve for inventory shrinkage for the
period between physical inventories based on historical results of previous
physical inventories, shrinkage trends or other judgments management believes
to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Property and Equipment
Property is depreciated by use of the straight-line method for financial
reporting purposes. Buildings are depreciated over 33 1/3 years. Leasehold
costs and improvements are amortized over the lease term or their estimated
useful life, whichever is shorter. Furniture, fixtures and equipment are
depreciated over three to ten years. Interest related to the development of
owned facilities is capitalized.
Normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
The Company reviews the realizability of its long-lived assets whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not
be recoverable. Current and expected operating results and cash flows and other
factors are considered in connection with the Company reviews. For purposes
of evaluating the recoverability of long-lived assets, the recoverability test
is performed using undiscounted net cash flows of individual clubs and
consolidated net cash flows for long-lived assets not identifiable to
individual clubs. Impairment losses are measured as the difference between the
carrying amount and the fair value of the impaired assets.
Accounts Payable
The Company banking arrangements provide for the daily replenishment of
vendor payable accounts as checks are presented. The balances of checks
outstanding in these bank accounts totaling $72,004,000 at February 2, 2002 and
$54,918,000 at February 3, 2001 are included in accounts payable on the balance
sheet.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of merchandise at the time of
purchase by the customer. Membership fee revenue is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the life of the membership, which is typically twelve
months.
24  Preopening Costs
Preopening costs consist of direct incremental costs of opening or
relocating a facility and are charged to operations as incurred.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs generally consist of promoting new memberships and new
store openings and also include television and radio advertising some of which
is vendor-funded during the holiday season. The Company expenses advertising
costs as incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company applies the accounting provisions prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,
APB 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for its stock-based
compensation.
Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value
because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued four new standards in 2001.  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 141, Business
Combinations, addresses financial accounting and reporting for all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and for combinations
accounted for using the purchase method for which the date of acquisition
is after June 30, 2001.  SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, addresses financial
accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible
assets and how they should be accounted for after initial recognition in
the financial statements. This statement becomes effective in 2002,
except that goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001
are subject immediately to the provisions of the statement.  SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, addresses
financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset
retirement costs. This statement becomes effective in 2003.  SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets, supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. SFAS No.
144 establishes a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be
disposed of by sale and resolves significant implementation issues
related to SFAS No. 121. This statement becomes effective in 2002.
Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 01-09, Accounting for
Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer, addresses the income statement
characterization of consideration given by a vendor to a customer and provides
guidance on recognizing and measuring sales incentives. EITF Issue No. 01-09
becomes effective in 2002.
The adoption of SFAS Nos. 141, 142 and 144 and EITF Issue No. 01-09 is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company results of operations,
financial position or cash flows, or to produce any major changes in current
disclosures. The Company is in the process of evaluating the requirements of
SFAS No. 143.
Estimates Included in Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
25 and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
A. Spin-off of the Company from Waban Inc. and Related Party Transactions
The Company, which previously had been a wholly owned subsidiary of Waban
Inc. Waban, became a separate and independent public entity on July 28,
1997, when Waban distributed to its stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the
Company outstanding common stock the spin-off.
Pursuant to the spin-off, the Company and Waban entered into a Tax Sharing
Agreement to provide for the payment of taxes and the entitlement to tax
refunds for periods prior to the spin-off date. Each party has agreed to
indemnify the other in specified circumstances if certain events occurring
after July 28, 1997 cause the spin-off or certain related transactions to
become taxable.
After the spin-off, the Company provided certain services to Waban which
has since changed its name to House2Home, Inc. formerly HomeBase, Inc. at
rates negotiated in accordance with a Services Agreement entered into between
the Company and House2Home. The amounts received by the Company for these
services were not material.
B. Loss on Contingent Lease Obligations
In connection with the spin-off of Waban by The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX
in 1989, Waban and TJX entered into an agreement pursuant to which Waban agreed
to indemnify TJX against any liabilities that TJX might incur with respect to
41 current House2Home leases as to which TJX was either a lessee or guarantor.
Pursuant to a subsequent agreement, BJ agreed to indemnify TJX for 100% of
House2Home lease liabilities through January 31, 2003 and for 50% of any such
liabilities thereafter.
House2Home filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code on November 7, 2001. In 2001, the Company recorded pretax
charges of $1064 million including interest accretion charges of $14
million for its estimated loss associated with House2Home leases. On a
post-tax basis, these charges totaled $638 million, or $87 per diluted share.
This loss was based on the present value of rent liabilities under these
leases, including estimated real estate taxes and common area maintenance
charges, reduced by estimated income from the subleasing of these properties.
An annual discount rate of 6% was used to calculate the present value of these
lease obligations.
Payments that the Company makes to settle its lease indemnification
obligations will reduce operating cash flows in varying amounts over the
remaining terms of the House2Home leases, which expire at various times up to
2016. The Company believes that these payments will not have a material impact
on its future financial condition or cash flows and that the liabilities
recorded in the financial statements adequately provide for its indemnification
obligations. However, there can be no assurance that the Company actual
liability under the TJX indemnification agreement will not differ materially
from amounts recorded in the financial statements due to a number of factors,
including future economic factors which may affect the ability to successfully
sublease the House2Home properties.
C. Debt
The Company has a $200 million unsecured credit agreement with a group of
banks which expires July 9, 2002. The agreement includes a $50 million
sub-facility for letters of credit, of which $23 million was outstanding at
February 2, 2002. The Company is required to pay an annual facility fee which
is currently 015% of the total commitment. Interest on borrowings is payable
at the Company option either at a the Eurodollar rate plus a margin which
is currently 030%, b the agent bank prime rate or c a rate determined by
competitive bidding. The facility fee and Eurodollar margin are both subject to
change based upon the Company fixed charge coverage ratio. The agreement
contains covenants which, among other things, include
26 minimum net worth and fixed charge coverage requirements and a maximum funded
debt-to-capital limitation, and prohibit the payment of cash dividends on the
Company common stock. In September 2001, the agreement was amended to
generally limit the cumulative repurchase of the Company common stock to $110
million plus 50% of net income as defined by the agreement earned after
January 30, 1998. The Company expects to enter into a new credit agreement
before the current agreement expires.
The Company also maintains a separate line in the amount of $41 million for
letters of credit, primarily to support the purchase of inventories, of which
$128 million was outstanding at February 2, 2002, and an additional $20
million uncommitted credit line for short-term borrowings.
There were no bank borrowings outstanding at February 2, 2002 and February
3, 2001.
D. Commitments and Contingencies
The Company is obligated under long-term leases for the rental of real
estate and equipment, some of which are classified as capital leases pursuant
to SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases. In addition, the Company is generally
required to pay insurance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses and,
in some cases, additional rentals based on a percentage of sales or other
factors. The real estate leases range up to 45 years and have varying renewal
options. The equipment leases range up to 5 years.
Future minimum lease payments as of February 2, 2002 were                            Capital  Operating

Total minimum operating lease payments above have not been reduced by
minimum sublease rentals of $1,730,000 due in the future under noncancelable
subleases of BJ properties.
Rental expense under operating leases including contingent rentals, which
were not material amounted to $76,895,000, $68,906,000 and $57,148,000 in
2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively.
The Company is involved in various legal proceedings that are typical of a
retail business. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these
proceedings or any related claims, the Company believes that such proceedings
or claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition or results of operations.
E. Capital Stock
During 2001, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an
additional $150 million of the Company common stock in addition to the $150
million previously authorized. In 2001, the Company repurchased 2,145,700
shares of common stock for $95,774,000, or an average price of $4464 per
share. The
27 Company repurchased 2,088,200 shares for $64,346,000 in 2000 and 1,190,702
shares for $35,024,000 in 1999. As of February 2, 2002, the Company remaining
repurchase authorization was $73,926,000.
The Company has a shareholder rights plan, originally adopted in 1997 and
amended in 1999, pursuant to which shareholders are issued one-half of a Right
for each share of common stock. Each Right entitles the holder to purchase from
the Company 1/1000 share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock
Series A Preferred Stock at a price of $120. The Company has designated
100,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for issuance under the shareholder
rights plan; none has been issued to date. Generally, the terms of the Series A
Preferred Stock are designed so that 1/1000 share of Series A Preferred Stock
is the economic equivalent of one share of the Company common stock. The
Rights are exercisable only if a person acquires 20% or more of the Company
common stock or commences a tender offer that would result in such person
owning 30% or more of the Company common stock. In addition, in general, if
after a person has become a 20% owner, the Company is involved in a business
combination transaction in which it is not the surviving corporation or in
connection with which the Company common stock is changed, or the Company
disposes of 50% or more of its assets or earning power, each Right that has not
previously been exercised or voided will entitle its holder to purchase that
number of shares of common stock of such other person which equals $120 divided
by one-half of the then current market price of such common stock. The Company
will generally be entitled to redeem the Rights at $01 per Right at any time
until the tenth business day following public announcement that a person has
become a 20% owner. The Rights expire on July 10, 2007, unless earlier redeemed
or exchanged.
The Company has authorized 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $01 par
value, of which no shares have been issued.
In December 1997, one of the Company subsidiaries issued 126 shares of
non-voting preferred stock to individual stockholders at $2,200 per share.
These shares are each entitled to receive ongoing annual dividends of $200 per
share. The minority interest in this subsidiary is equal to the preferred
shares' preference in an involuntary liquidation of $277,200 and is included in
other noncurrent liabilities in the Company consolidated balance sheets at
February 2, 2002 and February 3, 2001.
F. Stock Incentive Plans
Under its 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, the Company has granted certain key
employees options to purchase common stock at prices equal to 100% of market
price on the grant date. These options, which expire ten years from the grant
date, are generally exercisable 25% per year starting one year after the grant
date. The maximum number of shares of common stock issuable under this plan is
5,249,402 shares, plus shares subject to awards granted under the BJ
Wholesale Club, Inc. 1997 Replacement Stock Incentive Plan the Replacement
Plan which are not actually issued because such awards expire or are
canceled. Under the Replacement Plan, which expired on January 28, 1998, BJ
employees who held Waban stock options and restricted stock were granted
replacement BJ options and restricted stock, which preserved the same
inherent value, vesting terms and expiration dates as the Waban awards they
replaced in connection with the spin-off.
Under its 1997 Director Stock Option Plan, BJ external directors are
granted options to purchase common stock at prices equal to 100% of market
price on the grant date. These options expire ten years from the grant date and
are exercisable in three equal annual installments beginning on the first day
of the month which includes the first anniversary of the date of grant. A
maximum of 300,000 shares may be issued under the 1997 Director Stock Incentive
Plan.
As of February 2, 2002 and February 3, 2001, respectively, 633,570 and
1,349,287 shares were reserved for future stock awards under the Company
stock incentive plans.
The Company applies APB 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for its
stock-based compensation. Total pretax compensation cost recognized in the
statements of income for stock-based employee compensation awards was $29,000
in 2001, $23,000 in 2000 and $19,000 in 1999 and consisted entirely of
restricted stock
28 expense, which is charged to income ratably over the periods during which the
restrictions lapse. 2,000 shares of restricted stock were issued during 2000 at
a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $3706. No restricted stock was
issued in 2001 or 1999. No compensation cost has been recognized under APB 25
for the Company stock options because the exercise price equaled the market
price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and has
been determined as if the Company had accounted for its stock options under the
fair value method of that statement. The fair value for these options was
estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following weighted-average assumptions: risk-free interest rates of 400 612% and 619% in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively; volatility factor of the
expected market price of the Company common stock of 40 in 2001 and 42 in
2000 and 1999; and expected life of the options of 5 years in 2001, 2000 and
1999. No dividends were expected. The weighted-average fair value of options
granted was $1875 in 2001, $1621 in 2000 and $1320 in 1999.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of
highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.
Because the Company employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its stock options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The Company
pro forma information follows                        Fiscal Year Ended

disclosure are not necessarily representative of the effects on reported net
income for future years because options vest over several years and additional
awards generally are made each year.

The Company has not established a valuation allowance because its deferred
tax assets can be realized by offsetting deferred tax liabilities and future
taxable income, which management believes will more likely than not be earned,
based on the Company historical earnings record and projected future earnings.
I. Pensions
Under the Company 401k Savings plans, participating employees may make
pretax contributions up to 15% of covered compensation. The Company matches
employee contributions at 100% of the first one percent of covered compensation
and 50% of the next four percent. The Company expense under these plans was
$3,245,000, $3,166,000 and $2,657,000 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
The Company has a non-contributory defined contribution retirement plan for
certain key employees. Under this plan, the Company funds annual retirement
contributions for the designated participants on an after-tax basis. For the
last three years, the Company contributions equaled 5% of the participants'
base salary. Participants become fully vested in their contribution accounts at
the end of the fiscal year in which they complete four years of service. The
Company pretax expense under this plan was $991,000, $990,000 and $856,000 in
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
J. Postretirement Medical Benefits
The Company has a defined benefit postretirement medical plan which covers
employees and their spouses who retire after age 55 with at least 10 years of
service, who are not eligible for Medicare, and who participated in a
Company-sponsored medical plan. Amounts contributed by retired employees under
this plan are based on years of service prior to retirement. The plan is not
funded.
