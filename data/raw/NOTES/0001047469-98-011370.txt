REPORT OF MANAGEMENT
Stockholders of
USCS International, Inc.
The Company management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and
objectivity of the consolidated financial statements and other financial
information presented in this report. The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and
reflect the effects of certain estimates and judgments made by management.
Management maintains an effective system of internal control that is
designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and
transactions are properly recorded and executed in accordance with management
authorization. The system is continuously monitored by direct management review
and by internal audit. The Company selects and trains qualified people who are
provided with and expected to adhere to the Company standards of business
conduct. These standards, which set forth the highest principles of business
ethics and conduct, are a key element of the Company control system. It is
management responsibility to proactively foster an environment conducive to
these principles.
The Company consolidated financial statements have been audited by Price
Waterhouse LLP, independent accountants. Their audits were conducted in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and included a review of
financial controls and such tests of accounting records and procedures as they
considered necessary in the circumstances. Management made available to them all
of the Company financial records and data. Management believes that all
representations made to Price Waterhouse LLP were valid.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors meets regularly with
management and the independent accountants to review accounting, reporting,
auditing and internal control matters. The committee has direct and private
access to external auditors.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of USCS International, Inc.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of USCS
International, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. GENERAL
USCS International, Inc. the Company, a Delaware corporation, provides
transaction-based comprehensive customer management software and services and
bill processing services and solutions to the global communications industry and
other high volume services companies and sells, maintains and leases computer
systems primarily in North America. The Company generally provides software and
bill processing services to cable television and multi-service providers under
long-term bundled service contracts. The Company also provides bill processing
services on a stand-alone basis primarily to clients in the telecommunications
market. In June 1996, the Company completed an initial public offering IPO of
its common stock.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Consolidation--The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany
accounts and transactions.
Financial Statement Preparation--The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition--The Company recognizes services revenue monthly as the
services are performed. Fixed fees and the present value of minimum fees under
software licenses are recognized as revenue upon installation. Variable software
license fees are a component of fees billed under bundled service contracts and
are recognized as revenue over the life of the license based on usage. Revenue
from equipment sales is recognized as equipment is shipped. Income from
sales-type leases is recognized as revenue at a constant periodic rate of return
on the net investment in the lease. Billing for services in advance of
performance is recorded as deferred revenue.
In November 1997, the AICPA issued Statement of Position No. 97-2 Software
Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2, which is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1997. The Company has evaluated the provisions of SOP 97-2
and does not expect the adoption of SOP 97-2 to have a material impact on the
Company revenue recognition policies.
Concentration of Credit Risk--Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of
trade accounts receivable. A majority of the Company trade receivables are
derived from sales to the cable television and telecommunications industries.
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial
condition and, generally, requires no collateral. The Company maintains an
allowance for doubtful accounts on its receivables based upon expected
collectibility of all accounts receivable. Uncollectible amounts have not been
significant.
Paper Products and Other Inventory--Paper products and other inventory is
stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates actual cost determined
on a first-in, first-out basis, or market.
Property and Equipment--Property and equipment is recorded at cost.
Depreciation and amortization expense is recognized on the declining balance and
straight-line methods over useful lives ranging from two to seven years on
equipment and thirty-one to forty years on buildings.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Research and Development--Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred and consist primarily of software development costs incurred prior to
the achievement of technological feasibility. The Company capitalizes software
development costs after the products reach technological feasibility. These
costs are amortized on a product-by-product basis using the greater of the
amount computed by taking the ratio of current year net revenue to estimated
future net revenue or the amount computed by the straight-line method over the
estimated useful life of the product. No amortization has been recorded to date.
The Company evaluates the net realizable value of capitalized software
development costs on a product-by-product basis in accordance with SFAS 86. The
cost of custom development that is required by a specific client is charged to
cost of revenue.
Customer Deposits--The Company requires postage deposits of its clients
based on long-term contractual arrangements. The Company does not anticipate
repaying in the next year amounts classified as non-current.
Foreign Currency Translation--The functional currency of the Company
foreign subsidiary is the foreign currency. Adjustments arising from the
translation of balance sheets to U.S. dollars at the year-end exchange rates are
included in stockholders' equity. Income and expenses are translated at the
average prevailing rate during the year.
Earnings Per Share--The Company has presented earnings per share in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings
Per Share SFAS 128. All previously reported amounts have been restated to
conform to SFAS 128. In addition, pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission
SEC guidelines, earnings per share for all periods prior to the IPO have
been restated in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 98 SAB
98. See Note 11.
Stock-Based Compensation--The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
arrangements with employees and directors in accordance with the provisions of
APB No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and complies with the
disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. Under APB No. 25, compensation cost is recognized based on the
difference, if any, on the date of grant between the fair value of the Company
stock and the amount an employee or director must pay to acquire the stock.
Treasury Stock--The Company, from time to time, at the authorization of the
Board of Directors, repurchases shares of the Company common stock to be held
as treasury stock with reservation of such treasury stock for future issuance
under various employee stock purchase and incentive stock option plans, and for
distributions to the Company 401k Retirement Plan.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements--In June 1997, Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income SFAS 130 and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 131, Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information SFAS 131 were issued. The adoption
of both statements is required for years beginning after December 31, 1997. SFAS
130 requires, in addition to net income, the identification, classification and
presentation of items of comprehensive income, as defined by the statement, in
the Company financial statements and notes thereto. SFAS 131 requires separate
reporting in the financial statements of certain financial and descriptive
information about operating segments. The Company will report comprehensive
income for the first quarter of 1998 and segment reporting for the year ended
December 31, 1998. The Company does not expect the adoption of the statements to
have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

4. BENEFITS PLANS
The Company has an employee savings and pension benefit plan known as the
401k Retirement Plan. This plan covers substantially all employees. The
Company matches employee contributions of up to six percent of compensation at a
rate of fifty percent. The Company is required to make a contribution of 3% of
each eligible employee annual compensation. Commencing in 1996, under the
plan profit-sharing element, the Company also contributes 10% of pretax
profits. Prior to 1996, under the plan profit-sharing element, the Company
could contribute up to 3% of each eligible employee compensation determined at
the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company contribution expense was
$6,737,000, $5,179,000 and $4,204,000 in 1997, 1996 and 1995.
The Company may fund the plan profit-sharing element either with cash or
with shares of the Company common stock. The Company intends to fund the 1997
obligation to the 401k with shares held in treasury at the fair market value
on the date of contribution.
The Company had two defined contribution stock ownership plans ESOP
covering substantially all employees who were employed by the Company as of
February 18, 1993. There were no contributions to the plans in 1997, 1996 and
1995. Under the plans, the Company was obligated, at the employee option, to
repurchase vested shares at the current fair market value upon termination or
retirement. Substantially all share repurchases in 1996 and prior years resulted
from the repurchase of shares from former employees. The Company repurchase
obligations under the plans lapsed effective with the IPO. In 1997, the Board of
Directors terminated the Company ESOP effective January 1, 1997. An initial
distribution from the ESOP trust occurred in August 1997, with a total of
approximately 518,000 shares and cash of

4. BENEFITS PLANS CONTINUED
$579,000 distributed to the participants. In December 1997, the remaining
approximately 2,900,000 shares and cash of $97,000 were distributed.
The Company has non-qualified deferred compensation plans for senior
management and certain highly compensated employees. The plans permit
participants to defer a portion of their compensation and may provide additional
life insurance benefits until termination of their employment at which time
payment of amounts deferred is made in a lump sum or annual installments.
Deferred amounts accrue interest at a rate determined by the Board of Directors
or are credited with deemed gains or losses of the underlying investments. At
December 31, 1997, amounts deferred under the plans and the related accrued
interest were not material.
5. LONG-TERM DEBT
Long-term debt consists of the following at December 31 dollars in
thousands:
MATURITIES  1997    1996
Credit agreement with a finance company, collateralized, without recourse, by     1998   $  4,559 $  8,027

Company choice of LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 55% to 125%, the bank
base rate or a quoted rate rate of 694% at December 31, 1997.
Under the borrowing agreements, the Company is required to maintain certain
financial ratios and meet a net worth test. In addition, the Company has four
outstanding standby letters of credit totaling $4,684,000 at December 31, 1997.

9. LEASING ACTIVITIES
LEASES
The net investment in sales-type leases held by the Company and its leasing
subsidiary reflects the gross lease receivable and the estimated residual value
of the leased equipment less unearned income. The net investment in sales-type
leases consists of the following at December 31 in thousands:
1997    1996
Total minimum lease payments  $ 12,858 $ 15,516
Estimated unguaranteed residual value of leased property.     10     8
Gross investment in    12,868   15,524
Less unearned    2,290   4,350
Net investment in    10,578   11,174
Less current    5,892   4,922
Non-current  $  4,686 $  6,252
Lease transactions which do not meet the criteria of a sales-type lease are
accounted for as operating leases. Leased equipment is recorded at cost and
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term to the
estimated residual value at the expiration of the lease term. Income is
recognized monthly on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Operating leases are non-cancelable. At December 31, 1997, equipment leased to
clients under operating leases had a cost of $7,462,000 and a net book value of
$4,951,000.
Future payments to be received under leases are in thousands:
SALES-TYPE  OPERATING
$  7,871  $  2,075
3,375    2,062
1,612     938
$ 12,858  $  5,075
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients and generally
maintains a perfected security interest on all equipment leased under sales-type
and operating leases as collateral for lease payments receivable. Substantially
all lease contracts have been pledged and the related receipts have been
assigned to various lenders as collateral for nonrecourse borrowings. The
borrowing agreements provide that the debt is to be satisfied solely from
amounts due under the terms of the lease contracts and the value of the leased
equipment. The lenders' collateral interest in both the lease agreement and the
equipment terminates upon repayment of the debt.
SUBSIDIARY
At December 31, 1997 and 1996, the Company wholly owned leasing subsidiary
had total assets of $17,061,000 and $16,197,000 and long-term debt of $4,559,000
and $8,027,000, respectively. Net income was $1,794,000, $1,147,000 and
$1,352,000 in 1997, 1996 and 1995.

STOCK OPTION PLANS
The Company has five stock option plans under which shares of the Company
common stock have been reserved for issuance to directors, officers and key
employees.
Under the 1988, 1990, 1993 and 1996 Stock Option Plans, options may be
granted at prices and with terms and conditions established by the Company
Board of Directors at the date of grant. Options vest over periods of up to
sixty months and expire ten years after the date of grant.
Under the Director Stock Option Plan, options may be granted at fair
market value. Options vest annually over three years and expire five years after
the date of grant.
Information regarding the Company stock option plans is summarized below:

At December 31, 1997, 1,962,936 shares were available for future grants
under the stock option plans.
For purposes of the following pro forma disclosures required by SFAS 123,
the estimated fair value of options is amortized to expense over the options'
vesting period. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes option
model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that
have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option
valuation models, such as the Black-Scholes model, require the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, which are
subject to change from time to time. For this reason, and because the SFAS 123
fair-value based method of accounting has not been applied to options granted
prior to January 1, 1995, the resulting pro forma compensation costs are not
necessarily indicative of costs to be expected in future years.

Exercise prices of some options differ from the market price of the stock on
the grant date. During 1997, 1996 and 1995, options for 561,190, 1,229,074 and
551,775 shares of stock were granted at a weighted average exercise price of
$1745, $1320 and $505 per share, respectively, which equaled the weighted
average fair value on the date of grant.
In addition, during 1997, options to purchase 105,740 shares were granted at
$1755 per share. The fair value on the date of grant was $1663 per share. The
optionees are entitled to receive a bonus of $1655 per share exercised. There
were no grants in 1997, 1996, or 1995 with exercise prices greater than the
market price at the date of grant.
Compensation expense recognized in accordance with APB 25 was not material
in 1997, 1996 and 1995.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
In April 1996, the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the
Plan which was implemented in 1997. Under the Plan, shares are purchased on a
quarterly basis at 95% 90% as of January 1, 1998 of the lower of fair market
value of the Company common stock on the first or last business day of each
calendar quarter. Shares purchased under the Plan may not be sold or otherwise
transferred for six months after issuance. Common stock purchases under the Plan
totaled approximately 19,000 shares at a weighted average purchase price of
$1841. The weighted average fair value of the employee purchase rights and
compensation expense, as calculated under SFAS 123 using the Black-Scholes
option valuation model, was immaterial.
11. EARNINGS PER SHARE
The Company has presented earnings per share in accordance with SFAS 128.
Under SFAS 128, basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average
number of outstanding registered shares. Diluted earnings per share are computed
using weighted average registered shares and common stock equivalents, including
the net shares issuable upon exercise of stock options when dilutive.
Pursuant to SEC guidelines, the Company earnings per share calculation for
all periods prior to the IPO included additional dilution from certain common
stock and common stock equivalents issued within one year prior to the IPO.
These shares were included in the calculation as if they were outstanding for
all periods prior to their issuance. In February 1998, the SEC issued SAB 98
which amends this treatment and requires all earnings per share calculations
presented to conform with SFAS 128. All earnings per share amounts presented
have been restated to reflect the application of SFAS 128 and SAB 98.
The following table reconciles net income and weighted average shares
outstanding for the basic earnings per share and the diluted earnings per share
computation. Common stock equivalents consist solely of the net shares issuable
upon the exercise of stock options when dilutive.
