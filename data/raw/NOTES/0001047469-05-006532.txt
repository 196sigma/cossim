Natrol,Inc.      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    
1.Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Description of Business 
Natrol,Inc. and subsidiaries collectively, the Company manufactures and markets branded, high-quality dietary supplement products under
three branded labels, Natrol, Laci Le Beau and Prolab. The Company core Natrol brand markets vitamins, minerals, hormonal supplements, herbal products, and specialty combination formulations. The
Laci Le Beau brand sells specialty teas and the Prolab brand markets sports nutrition products to athletes and other health minded individuals. The Company sells its products through multiple channels
of distribution that reach consumers through mass market retailers, health food stores, fitness centers, the Internet, catalogues and other points of distribution. 
The
Company also sells raw materials and markets limited contract manufacturing through its Essentially Pure Ingredients division which operates within the Company core operating unit. 
Principles of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of Natrol,Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. 
Estimates and Assumptions 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates, although
management does not believe any differences would materially affect the Company consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
Significant Risks and Uncertainties 
Product returns are a recurring part of the Company business. Estimating product returns requires significant management judgment. Products may be returned for
various reasons including expiration dates or lack of sufficient sales. During 2004, returns and reimbursements for damages and outdated products were 35% of gross shipments a decrease from 2003 and
2002 when returns and reimbursements for damages and outdated products were respectively 47% and 87% of gross sales. There is no guarantee that future returns will not increase to, or exceed, the
levels experienced in 2002. Furthermore, the possibility exists that should the Company lose a major account, the Company may agree to accept a substantial amount of returns. 
The
Company monitors its inventory and analyzes it on a regular basis. Cycle counts are taken daily to verify inventory levels. In addition, the Company analyzes the movement of items
within its inventory in an effort to determine the likelihood that inventory will be sold or used before expiration dates are reached. The Company provides an allowance against that portion of its
inventory that it believes is unlikely to be sold or used before expiration dates are reached. At December31, 2004, inventory allowances were approximately $14million. Restricted Cash 
Restricted cash represents cash that has been deposited with an insurance company as part of the Company self-insurance program. The cash earns
interest at a current rate of 165% per annum, and 
44  will
be returned to the Company should the Company terminate the policy. The policy, which is cancelable by the Company, is effective through 2008. Inventory 
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost determined by the first-in, first-out method or market. 
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets
ranging from three-to-ten years for furniture, machinery and equipment. Buildings are depreciated over 40years, and improvements are depreciated over periods ranging
from five-to-forty years, using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the
shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms. 
Long-Lived Assets 
The Company evaluates long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. 
Goodwill 
In June2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB approved two new statements: Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
SFAS No141 requires business combinations entered into after June30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. SFAS No142 requires that goodwill not
be amortized, but be tested for impairment at least annually. The Company adopted SFAS No142 on January1, 2002. In accordance with such adoption, the Company identified all reporting
units in conjunction with the provisions of SFAS No142 and allocated all goodwill accordingly. Beginning in 2002, goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually as of December31. The
Company tested goodwill for impairment using the two-step process prescribed in SFAS No142. The first step is a screen for potential impairment, while the second step measures the
amount of the impairment, if any. In 2002, the Company performed the first step of the impairment test and that there was potential impairment of the Natrol segment. The Company performed the second
step as of December31, 2002 for the Natrol segment and determined that its goodwill balance of $10,958,000 was impaired. The impairment loss was recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting
change in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2002. 
The
Company performed its annual impairment test as of December31, 2004 and December31, 2003 and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in either year. 
45  As
part of a legal settlement with the former owners of Prolab, in 2004, the Company received $20million which was recorded as reduction of goodwill. The balance of goodwill as
of December31, 2004, therefore, was reduced to approximately $2million. 
The
changes in the carrying value of goodwill for the years ended December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 were as follows in thousands: Balance, December 31, 2001 14,984 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 10,958 Balance, December 31, 2002 and 2003 4,026 Reduction of goodwill from legal settlement in 2004 2,000 Balance, December 31, 2004 2,026 Income Taxes 
Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax
rates. Management provides a valuation allowance when it believes, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. 
Revenue Recognition 
The Company sells its products to retail outlets through a direct sales force and a national broker network. The Company recognizes revenue from sales when
product is shipped and title is transferred. Net sales represent product shipped less actual and estimated returns, spoilage allowances, allowances for product deemed to be unsaleable by customers,
free goods shipped to customers for promotional or other purposes and slotting fees. Estimates and allowances are based upon known claims and an estimate of additional returns when the amount of
future returns can be reasonably estimated. 
Advertising Costs 
Advertising and promotional costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising and promotional costs were in thousands $6,122, $5,427, and $6,778 for the years ended
December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. These amounts are exclusive of promotional and other costs that are netted against sales revenue. 
Research and Development Costs 
The Company incurs costs in support of its dietary research and development. These costs are expensed as incurred and were in thousands $752, $608, and $504,
for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
Shipping and Handling Costs 
The Company records all amounts charged to customers for shipping and handling as revenue. All shipping and fulfillment costs are classified as selling and
marketing expenses and were in thousands $3,455, $3,172, and $2,504, for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
46  Stock-Based Compensation 
As allowed under SFAS123, the Company accounts for its employee stock option plan under the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. The
Company has a stock-based compensation plan, which is described more fully in Note5. The Company operating results do not include a compensation charge related to this
plan, as all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The following table illustrates the effect on the operating results
and per share amounts, if the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, had been applied to
stock-based employee compensation. Years Ended December 31 2004

These
assumptions resulted in weighted-average fair values of $166, $087, and $087 for each stock option granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
Income Loss Per Share 
The Company calculates income loss per share in accordance with SFAS No128, Earnings per Share. Basic
income loss per share has been computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income loss per share has been computed
by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents stock options. 
Stock
options to purchase 2,442,000, 2,950,000, and 2,916,000 shares of common stock at December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were outstanding and of these shares,
520,000, 2,950,000 and 2,916,000, were respectively considered anti-dilutive. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The carrying value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates
fair market value based on their short-term nature. The fair value of the Company long-term notes payable is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the
Company current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The estimated fair value of long-term notes payable exceeded the carrying value by approximately
$11million at December31, 2004. Concentration of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, and accounts
receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are placed with high credit-quality institutions and the amount of credit exposure to any one institution is limited. Significant portions of the Company sales
are made directly to mass merchandisers and national retailers. Due to the increased volume of sales to these channels, the Company has experienced an increased concentration of credit risk, and as a
result, may at anytime have individually significant receivable balances with such mass merchandisers and national retailers. While the Company monitors and manages this risk, financial difficulties
on the part of one or more major customers may have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers and maintains an allowance for potential
credit losses. 
No
one customer represented 10% or more of the Company net sales in 2004 and 2003 and no account represented more than 10% of the Company net accounts receivable as of
December31, 2004. Accounts receivable from one customer represented approximately 160% of net accounts receivable at December31, 2003. One customer represented 123% of net sales in
the year ended December31, 2002. This customer accounted for 134% of accounts receivable at December31, 2002. No other customers represented more than 10% of net sales in 2002. Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
In December2002, the FASB issued SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure. This statement
amends SFAS No123, to provide alternative methods of 
48  voluntary
transition to change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. Additionally, this statement amends disclosure requirements of accounting for stock-
based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reporting results. As of December31, 2002, the Company has adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No148, but has
elected to continue to account for stock-based compensation to its employees and directors using the intrinsic value method proscribed by APB No25 and related interpretations. 
In
January2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46. In December2003, FIN 46 was replaced by FASB
interpretation No46R Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46R clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No51, Consolidated Financial Statements,
to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have
sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46R requires an enterprise to consolidate a variable
interest entity if that enterprise will absorb a majority of the entity expected losses, is entitled to receive a majority of the entity expected residual returns, or both. FIN 46R is effective
for entities being evaluated under FIN 46R for consolidation no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after March15, 2004. The Company does not currently have any
variable interest entities that will be impacted by adoption of FIN 46R. 
On
April30, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS
No149 amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No133.
The new guidance amends SFAS No133 for decisions made as part of the Derivatives Implementation Group DIG process that effectively required amendments to SFAS No133, and
decisions made in connection with other FASB projects dealing with financial instruments and in connection with implementation issues raised in relation to the application of the definition of a
derivative and characteristics of a derivative that contains financing components. In addition, it clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the
statement of cash flows. SFAS No149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June30, 2003.
Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. In
May2003, the FASB issued SFAS No150 Accounting for Financial Instruments with the Characteristics of Both Liabilities and
Equities. SFAS No150 establishes standards regarding the manner in which an issuer classifies and measures certain types of financial instruments having
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. Pursuant to SFAS No150, such freestanding financial instruments i.e., those entered into separately from an entity other financial
instruments or equity transactions or that are legally detachable and separately exercisable must be classified as liabilities or, in some cases, assets. In addition, SFAS No150 requires
that financial instruments containing obligations to repurchase the issuing entity equity shares and, under certain circumstances, obligations that are settled by delivery of the issuer shares be
classified as liabilities. Certain aspects of SFAS No150 have been deferred; however, the Statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May31, 2003
and for other instruments at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June15, 2003. The Company does not currently have any financial instruments that 
49  have
been impacted by SFAS No150. The adoption of SFAS No150 did not have a material impact on the Company financial position or results of operations. In
December2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No104, Revenue Recognition. SAB 104, which was effective upon issuance, updates portions of the
interpretive guidance included in Topic 13 of the codification of Staff Accounting Bulletins and revises or rescinds portions of the interpretative guidance included in SAB 101 in order to make this
interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and SEC rules and regulations. The principal revisions relate to the incorporation of certain sections of
the staff Frequently Asked Question FAQ document on revenue recognition into Topic 13. SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements, which was issued in December1999, provides guidance to SEC registrants on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenues in the financial statements. Since the Company
has already adopted all such standards upon issuance, the application of this revised guidance did not impact its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or disclosure requirements. 
In
November2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No151, Inventory Costs an amendment of
Accounting Research Bulletin ARB No43, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material spoilage. This Statement
requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal. In addition, this Statement requires that allocation of fixed
production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. Companies are required to adopt the provisions of this Statement for fiscal years
beginning after June15, 2005. The Company does not believe there will be a material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations from the adoption of this standard. 
In
December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. The
amendments made by Statement 153 are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. Further, the amendments eliminate
the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance.
Previously, Opinion 29 required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be
based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished. Opinion 29 provided an exception to its basic measurement principle fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets. The Board believes
that exception required that some nonmonetary exchanges, although commercially substantive, be recorded on a carryover basis. By focusing the exception on exchanges that lack commercial substance, the
Board believes this Statement produces financial reporting that more faithfully represents the economics of the transactions. The Statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in
fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2005. Earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after the date of issuance. The provisions
of this Statement shall be applied prospectively. The Company has evaluated the impact of the adoption of SFAS152, and does not believe the impact will be significant to the Company overall
results of operations or financial position. 
50  In
December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment. Statement 123R will provide investors and other users of financial statements with more
complete and neutral financial information by requiring that the compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. That cost will be measured based
on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. Statement 123R covers a wide range of share-based compensation arrangements including share options, restricted share plans,
performance-based awards, share appreciation rights, and employee share purchase plans. Statement 123R replaces FASB
Statement No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Statement 123, as originally issued in 1995,
established as preferable a fair-value-based method of accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees. However, that Statement permitted entities the option of continuing
to apply the guidance in Opinion 25, as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair-value-based method been used. Public
entities other than those filing as small business issuers will be required to apply Statement 123R as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June15, 2005. The
Company has evaluated the impact of the adoption of SFAS123R, and does not believe the impact will be significant to the Company overall results of operations or financial position. 
In
December 2004 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued two FASB Staff PositionsFSP FAS109-1, Application of FASB Statement 109
Accounting for Income Taxes to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and FSP FAS 109-2 Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the
Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Neither of these
affected the Company as it does not participate in the related activities.

7.Employee Benefits Plans 
The Company has a profit sharing 401k plan that covers substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to the maximum allowed under
law. Contributions are discretionary; however, the Company generally matches 10% of the employees' contributions up to the maximum of 1% of eligible compensation. Amounts recognized as expense were
approximately $33,000, $26,000, and $14,000, for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
In

8.Impairment of Goodwill 
On January1, 2002, the Company adopted SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No142 requires that goodwill not
be amortized. In accordance with such adoption, the Company identified all reporting units in conjunction with the provisions of SFAS No142 and allocated all goodwill accordingly. Beginning
in 2002, goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually, or whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. In 2002, the Company tested goodwill for impairment using the two-step process prescribed in
SFAS No142. The first step is a screen for potential impairment, while the second step measures the amount of the impairment, if any. The Company performed the impairment test and determined
that there was potential impairment of the Natrol segment. The Company performed the second step as of January1, 2002 for the Natrol segment and determined that its goodwill balance of
$10,958,000 was impaired. The impairment loss was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of income tax benefit of approximately $41million, in the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2002. The
remaining goodwill balance at December31, 2002 and 2003 was approximately $40million. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company completed its annual goodwill
impairment testing and determined that goodwill was not impaired. Additionally, during March 2004, the Company settled its litigation with the former owners of Prolab Nutrition, Inc. The Company
received $2million in cash, which was reflected in the financial statements for the quarter ending March31, 2004 as a reduction of goodwill. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No142, the Company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2004 and concluded that it was not impaired. The
Company, as part of its review of financial results for 2004, performed an assessment of the carrying value of the Company goodwill recorded in connection with its various
acquisitions and determined that no impairment existed. The carrying value of the Company goodwill at December31, 2004 was approximately $2million. 
9.Discontinued Operations 
In December2003, the Company discontinued its Annasa and Tamsol units. Annasa, a subsidiary of Natrol, a multi-level marketer of proprietary nutritional
products began operations in 2002. Tamsol was also formed in 2002, to generate direct-to-consumer sales via radio, television, direct mail and other non-retail
venues. The Company has reclassified its financial statements to segregate the revenues, direct costs and expenses excluding allocated costs, assets and liabilities and cash flows of the
discontinued operations. The net operating results, net assets and net cash flows of these businesses have been reported as Discontinued Operations in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. 
The
Company sold Annasa trademarks and certain other assets to an investor group led by former Annasa distributors. The Company received $35,000 for the intellectual property assets.
The investor group has agreed to also pay the Company a royalty of between one and two percent of net revenue for 20years.

Prior to the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company reported its revenue and income through three operating segments; Natrol, Annasa and Prolab. As discussed in
Note9, Annasa was discontinued in the fourth quarter of 2003. Additionally, the Company consolidated its Prolab operating unit into the core Natrol operating unit as of October1, 2003
and as of that date Prolab began operating as a brand within the core operating unit similar to the Company other brands. As of October1, 2003, the Company no longer considered Prolab a
separate operating segment. As a result, segment operating results are no longer being reported.
