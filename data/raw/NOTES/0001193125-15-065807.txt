Controls and Procedures The Company utilizes a cloud-based professional service automation system
provided by a third-party service organization, Changepoint, in the Companys consulting and education business lines. This system is used to track billable time used to invoice customers, as well as to track and process internal business
travel and entertainment expenses. The Companys contract with the third-party service organization requires that the third-party service organization provide to the Company, on an annual basis, a Service Organization Control SOC
1 Type 2 report in accordance with the AICPA Attestation Standards, Section 801, Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization, addressing the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to the
cloud-based system and business processing activities performed by the service organization on the Companys behalf. The third-party service organization provided such reports in the past.The Company relies upon this report, among other
things, in assessing the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. The third-party service organization did not provide an adequate SOC 1 Type 2 report for the year ended December 31, 2014. As a result, the Company did not have
evidence of the design and operating effectiveness of the automated transaction level controls to track billable time and expenses and internal business travel and entertainment expenses, and related general information technology controls intended
to prevent unauthorized system access and inappropriate change management for the cloud-based system at the third-party service organization, and accordingly, the Company has concluded that there is a material weakness in the Companys internal
control over financial reporting at December 31, 2014. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide
reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer
concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level because of a material weakness related to the control activities performed by the third-party service organization described
above. Although the Company has not received an adequate SOC 1 Type 2 report from the third-party service organization, management believes, based on substantive testing performed, that the financial statements included in this annual report fairly
present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. Managements Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys principal executive and principal financial
officers and effected by the Companys board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Such internal control includes those policies and procedures that:  Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and  Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014. In making this assessment, our management
used the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework 1992 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on its assessment, our management has identified the following deficiency
in internal control that we have deemed to be a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014: 
The Company had a failure of the operating effectiveness of a monitoring control designed to ensure that the Company obtains evidence of the
design and operating effectiveness of the automated transaction level controls related to a third-party service organizations cloud-based professional services automation system used to track billable time and expenses and internal business
travel and entertainment expenses information, and the related general information technology controls intended to prevent unauthorized system access and inappropriate change management to the cloud-based professional services automation system
and information contained within. Although no adjustment was required to our consolidated financial statements, management concluded that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement could occur in consulting revenue and travel and entertainment expenses in the consolidated financial statements if the control deficiency was not remediated. Accordingly, management concluded that
there is a material weakness in the Companys internal control over financial reporting and that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014. 
KPMG LLP has issued an adverse report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report is included in the Reports of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firms in . Planned Remediation of Material Weakness 
This cloud-based professional services automation system is used by the Company to track billable time used to invoice customers within the Companys
consulting business line, as well as to track and process the Companys internal business travel and entertainment expenses. The Company relies upon a SOC 1 Type 2 report from the service organization, in assessing the effectiveness of its
internal control over financial reporting as it relates to the design and operating effectiveness of the automated transaction level controls and the related general information technology controls described above. The Company was unable to obtain
an adequate SOC 1 Type 2 report from the service organization for the year ended December 31, 2014. To address this issue, the Company intends to implement alternative controls and additional testing procedures in the interim and to demand that the
third-party service organization provide an adequate, contractually required SOC 1 Type 2 report with respect to future periods, as well as to consider transitioning off of the cloud-based system provided by the third-party service organization.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Other than the identification of the material weakness described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2014 due to either ongoing or restructuring activities that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. Management plans to transition to the revised COSO 2013 Framework in 2015.
