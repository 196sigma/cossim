MERCURY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA A. Description of Business Mercury Computer Systems, Inc. the Company or Mercury designs,
manufactures and markets high-performance embedded computer systems and software. The primary areas of business for the Company are defense electronics, which includes radar, signals intelligence, sonar, smart weapons, and imagery applications;
imaging and visualization solutions, which includes life sciences medical diagnostic imaging and biotechnology, geosciences oil and gas exploration, and simulation applications; and commercial OEM solutions, which includes semiconductor test
inspection, reticle inspection, mask writing, and telecommunications test applications. These markets have computing needs that benefit from the unique system architecture developed by the Company. B.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies BASIS OF PRESENTATION The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2004, including amounts for cash and
cash equivalents, auction rate securities, deferred revenue and accounts receivable have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal year 2005 and 2006 presentation. Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2005,
including amounts for treasury stock, deferred revenue, accounts receivable and notes payable have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal year 2006 presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the previously reported net income or
shareholders equity. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company reclassified its presentation of unpaid deferred revenue to
deferred revenue to conform with current year presentation. Previously, all unpaid deferred revenue was classified as a contra-accounts receivable balance. Accordingly, the Company has revised the classification to exclude unpaid deferred revenue
from accounts receivable, thus increasing the balance by $1,272 at June30, 2005 and to include such amounts in deferred revenue and customer advances. In addition, the Company has made corresponding adjustments to the accompanying statements
of cash flows which resulted in a change in cash provided by certain operating assets and liabilities, but did not impact the total cash provided by operating activities. This change in classification does not affect the previously reported
consolidated statement of operations. In the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company concluded that it was appropriate to classify a
portion of the costs associated with the Companys retirement of treasury stock and common stock as a result of the enactment of the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act as a reduction of retained earnings. Previously, all such costs were
classified as a reduction in additional paid-in capital. Accordingly, the Company has revised the classification to increase additional paid-in capital by $48,309 and to decrease retained earnings by $48,309 at June30, 2005. This change in
classification does not affect the previously reported consolidated statement of operations or consolidated statement of cash flows. USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
53 Table of Contents
REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue from system sales is recognized upon shipment provided that title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, there is persuasive evidence of an
arrangement, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured, and customer acceptance criteria, if any, have been successfully demonstrated. Certain contracts with customers require the Company to perform tests of its products prior to shipment to ensure their performance complies with the
Companys published product specifications and, on occasion, with additional customer-requested specifications. In these cases, the Company conducts such tests and, if they are completed successfully, includes a written confirmation with each
order shipped. As a result, at the time of each product shipment, the Company believes that no further customer testing requirements exist and that there is no uncertainty of non-acceptance by its customer. In the limited instance that customer
payment is conditioned upon final acceptance testing by the customer at its own facility, the Company does not recognize any revenue until the final acceptance testing has been completed and written confirmation from the customer has been received.
For multiple-element arrangements, the Company defers the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the
portion of the sales price that is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered. For a delivered item to be considered a separate unit, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis, there must be objective and
reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement, and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially within the control of the Company. Fair value is generally limited to
the price charged when the same or similar element is sold separately or, if applicable, the stated substantive renewal rate in the agreement. Installation of the Companys products requires insignificant effort that does not alter the capabilities of the Companys products and may be performed by its customers or other vendors. If an order includes installation or
training services that are undelivered at the time of product shipment, the Company defers revenue equal to the fair value of the installation or training obligations until such time as the services have been provided. The Company determines these
fair values based on the price typically charged to its customers who purchase these services separately. For transactions involving the
licensing of standalone software products and of software that is not incidental to the product, the Company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery of the software has occurred, the price is fixed or
determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. The Companys standalone software products are not deemed essential to the functionality of any hardware system and do not require installation by the Company or
significant modification or customization of the software. The fair value of maintenance agreements related to standalone software products is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of each maintenance agreement. The Company also engages in long-term contracts for the development, production and services activities which it accounts for consistent with the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA audit and accounting guide, Audits of Federal Government Contractors, the AICPAs Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain
Production-Type Contracts, and other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature. The Company considers the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting for a particular
contract. Generally for fixed-price contracts, other than service-type contracts, revenue is recognized primarily under the percentage of completion method or, for certain short-term contracts, by the completed contract method. Revenue from
service-type fixed-price contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period or by other appropriate output methods to measure service provided, and contract costs are expensed as incurred. The risk to the company on a fixed-price contract is
that if estimates to complete the contract change from one period to the next, profit levels will vary from period to period. For time and materials contracts, revenue reflects the number of direct labor hours expended in the performance of a
contract multiplied by the contract billing rate, as well as reimbursement of 
54 Table of Contents
other billable direct costs. The risk inherent in time and materials contracts is that actual costs may differ materially from negotiated billing rates in
the contract, which would directly affect operating income. For all types of contracts, the company recognizes anticipated contract losses as soon as they become known and estimable. Out-of-pocket expenses that are reimbursable by the customer are
included in revenue and cost of revenue. The use of contract accounting requires significant judgment relative to estimating total
contract revenues and costs, including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the contract, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, anticipated increases in wages and prices for subcontractor services and materials,
and the availability of subcontractor services and materials. The Companys estimates are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of its engineers, program managers and other personnel, who review each long-term contract monthly to
assess the contracts schedule, performance, technical matters and estimated cost at completion. Changes in estimates are applied on a retrospective basis, that is to say when adjustments in estimated contract costs are identified, such
revisions may have the effect of adjusting in the current period the earnings applicable to performance in prior periods. With very
limited exceptions, the Company does not provide its customers with rights of product return, other than those related to warranty provisions that permit repair or replacement of defective goods. The Company accrues for anticipated warranty costs
upon product shipment. Currently, for the few commercial products that have rights of product return, the Company defers revenue until the return period ends due to the limited sales and returns history related to these products. Revenue from product royalties are recognized upon receipt of payment by the Company unless another reasonable and reliable method of recognition is more
appropriate. DEFERRED REVENUES AND CUSTOMER
ADVANCES Deferred revenues consist of deferred product revenue and, to a lesser extent, deferred service revenue. Deferred
product revenue represents amounts that have been invoiced to customers, but are not yet recognizable as revenue because one or more of the conditions for revenue recognition have not been met. Deferred service revenue primarily represents amounts
invoiced to customers for annual maintenance contracts, which are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangements. Customer advances represent deposits received from customers on an order. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash equivalents, consisting of money market funds and U.S. government and U.S. government agency issues with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at
the date of purchase, are carried at fair market value. MARKETABLE SECURITIES 
The Company classifies investments in marketable securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and periodically re-evaluates such
classification. There were no securities classified as trading or held-to-maturity as of June30, 2006 and 2005. Securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair market value. Unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale
securities are included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income until disposition of the security. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in
other income or expense. For determinations of gain or loss, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The fair value of cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in marketable securities represents the quoted market prices at the balance sheet dates. Debt securities with maturities at date of purchase 
55 Table of Contents
of greater than 90 days but less than one year to maturity at a particular balance sheet date are classified as short-term marketable securities. Debt
securities that have remaining maturities of greater than one year at a particular balance sheet date are classified as long-term marketable securities. The Company invests in auction rate securities, among other financial instruments. Auction rate securities are debt instruments with interest rates that generally reset every 7 to 28 days. Despite the long-term nature
of their stated contractual maturities, the Company has the ability to quickly liquidate investments in auction rate securities. Accordingly, these investments are classified as short-term. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, marketable securities and accounts
receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. At June30, 2006 and 2005, the Company had approximately $8,841 and $18,051, respectively, of cash on
deposit or invested with its primary financial and lending institution. There are no significant concentrations of investments in corporate debt securities with any single issuer of debt securities. The Company provides credit to customers in the normal course of business. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers
financial condition and limits the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary but generally does not require collateral. At June30, 2006, six customers accounted for 50% of the Companys receivables. At June30, 2005, four
customers accounted for 61% of the Companys receivables. INVENTORY Inventory is stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or market value, and consists of materials, labor and overhead. On a quarterly basis, the
Company uses consistent methodologies to evaluate inventory for net realizable value. The Company reduces the value of reporting inventory for excess and obsolete inventory, consisting of on-hand and non-cancelable on-order inventory in excess of
estimated usage. The excess and obsolete inventory evaluation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix and possible alternative uses. GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS Acquired intangible assets result from the Companys various business acquisitions see Note M to the consolidated financial statements and certain licensed technologies, and consist of identifiable intangible assets, including
completed technology, licensing agreements, customer backlog and customer relationships. Acquired intangible assets are reported at cost, net of accumulated amortization and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of
up to six years. Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of the acquired net assets in a business acquisition exceeded the fair values of
the net identifiable assets on the date of purchase. Goodwill is not amortized in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually, on a
reporting unit basis, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the
carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. 
56 Table of Contents
LONG-LIVED ASSETS Long-lived assets primarily include property and equipment and acquired intangible assets. The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets for
events and circumstances that indicate a potential impairment in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. Each impairment test is based on a comparison of the estimated
undiscounted cash flows of the asset as compared to the recorded value of the asset. If impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are the long-lived, physical assets of the Company acquired for use in the Companys normal business operations and are not
intended for resale by the Company. These assets are recorded at cost. Renewals and betterments that increase the useful lives of the assets are capitalized. Repair and maintenance expenditures that increase the efficiency of the assets are expensed
as incurred. The Company capitalizes interest costs associated with the development and construction of certain qualifying assets in accordance with SFAS No34, Capitalization of Interest Costs, over the period of construction.
Equipment under capital lease is recorded at the present value of the minimum lease payments required during the lease period. Depreciation is based on the following estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method:  Computer software and equipment
2to5years
Machinery and equipment
5 years
Furniture and fixtures
5 years
Buildings
15and30years
Building improvements
10 years
As assets are retired or sold, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations. Expenditures for major software purchases and software
developed for internal use are capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are generally 3 to 5 years. For software developed for internal use, all external direct costs for
material and services and certain payroll and related fringe benefit costs are capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. 
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS The Company capitalizes software development costs incurred after a products technological feasibility has been established and before it is
available for general release to customers. Amortization of capitalized software costs commences once the product is available for general release and is computed on an individual product basis based on the greater of athe ratio that current
gross revenues for a product bear to total anticipated gross revenues for that product, or bthe straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the product. Software development costs qualifying for capitalization were not material
for any of the years ended June30, 2006, 2005 and 2004. RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT COSTS Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. 
57 Table of Contents
IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT The Company values tangible and intangible assets acquired through its business acquisitions at fair value,
including in-process research and development IPRD. The Company determines IPRD through established valuation techniques for various projects for the development of new products and technologies and expenses IPRD when technological
feasibility is not reached. ADVERTISING COSTS The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. During the years ended June30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, advertising expenses totaled $500, $50 and
$141, respectively, and were included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY The Companys product sales generally include a 12 or
18month standard hardware warranty, with the exception of product sales in the MPS segment, which generally include a three-year standard hardware warranty. At time of product shipment, the Company accrues for the estimated cost to repair or
replace potentially defective products. Estimated warranty costs are based upon prior actual warranty costs for substantially similar transactions. INCOME TAXES The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for
the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence,
it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. NET
EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic net earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus additional common shares that
would have been outstanding if potential dilutive common shares had been issued for stock-based compensation. If dilutive, calculations of
diluted earnings per share also include the effect of the assumed conversion of the Companys contingently convertible notes into shares of common stock, including an increase to reported net income for interest expense net of tax incurred on
the notes that would not have been incurred if the debt had, in fact, been converted. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company has several stock-based employee compensation
plans. On July1, 2005, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payment, using the modified prospective method, which results in the provisions of SFAS 123R only being
applied to the consolidated financial statements on a going-forward basis that is, the prior period results were not restated. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date
based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period. Further, the 
58 Table of Contents
Company has elected under SFAS 123R to recognize the fair value of awards with pro-rata vesting on a straight-line basis. Previously, the Company had
followed Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations, which resulted in the accounting for employee share options at their intrinsic value in the consolidated
financial statements. The Companys determination of fair value of stock-based payment awards is affected by the Companys stock
price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to the Companys expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and the actual and projected
employee stock option exercise behaviors. Any changes in these assumptions may materially affect the estimated fair value of the stock-based award. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/ LOSS Comprehensive income/ loss
consists of net income and other comprehensive income loss, which includes foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on investments in marketable securities. For purposes of comprehensive income/loss disclosures,
the Company does not record tax provisions or benefits for the net changes in the foreign currency translation adjustment, as the Company intends to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss income were as follows:  Years EndedJune 30 2006 2005 Accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments 704 455 Accumulated net unrealized losses on securities 732 388 Total accumulated other comprehensive loss income 28 843
FOREIGN CURRENCY Local currencies are used as the functional currency for the Companys subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands and
Japan. The accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in effect at period-end for assets and liabilities and at average exchange rates during the period for results of operations. The related translation adjustments are
reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity. Gains losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense and were immaterial for all periods presented. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. The Interpretation clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This Interpretation presents a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006. While additional efforts will
be necessary to measure and disclose this information, the Company does not expect the adoption of Interpretation No48 to have a material impact on its financial statements. In June 2005, The FASB issued FSP FAS 143-1, Accounting for Electronic Waste Obligations. The obligations addressed in the FSP relate to those
which might be created under the operation of Directive 2002/96/EC on Electrical and Electronic Equipment adopted by the European Union in February 2003. The FSP 
59 Table of Contents
provides guidance on proper accounting for costs associated with retiring electronic equipment classified as Historical held by commercial users
on or before August13, 2005. Commercial users in EU countries that have adopted the law may be required to record an asset retirement obligation and to capitalize a related increase in the carrying value of the equipment subject to the
directive utilizing concepts outlined under FASB Statement No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, and the related FASB Interpretation No47, Accounting for Conditions Asset Retirement Obligations. The
effective date of this FSP is the first reporting period after June8, 2005 or the date of adoption of the law by the applicable EU-member country. The Company has evaluated whether the EU Directive is applicable to both its foreign
subsidiaries and to shipments abroad from its U.S. subsidiaries. Management has assessed the impact of the adoption of this accounting pronouncement and there was no material affect on operating results. In June2005, the FASB issued SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections: a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board
APBOpinion No20 and FASB Statement No3 SFAS 154. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application for voluntary changes in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to do so. Retrospective application refers
to the application of a different accounting principle to previously issued financial statements as if that principle had always been used. SFAS 154s retrospective-application requirement replaces APB Opinion No20s requirement to
recognize most voluntary changes in accounting principle by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. Under SFAS 154, correction of an error in previously issued financial
statements will continue to be accounted for by restating the prior-period financial statements, and a change in accounting estimate will continue to be accounted for prospectively. The requirements of SFAS 154 are effective for accounting changes
made in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005, however, early adoption is allowed. The Company adopted SFAS 154 during fiscal 2006. This adoption had no impact on fiscal 2006. C. Stock-Based Compensation STOCK OPTION PLANS The number of shares authorized for issuance under the
Companys 2005 Stock Incentive Plan the 2005 Plan is 1,942,264 shares as of the adoption of the 2005 Plan and will be increased by any future cancellations, forfeitures or terminations other than by exercise under the
Companys 1997 Stock Option Plan. The 2005 Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and deferred stock awards to employees and non-employees. All stock options are
granted with an exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair value of the Companys common stock at the date of grant and the options have a maximum term of 10 years. There were 948,090 shares available for future grant under the 2005 Plan
at June30, 2006. The number of shares authorized for issuance under the Companys 1997 Stock Option Plan the 1997
Plan is 8,650,000 shares, of which 100,000 shares may be issued pursuant to restricted stock grants. The 1997 Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options and restricted stock to employees and non-employees. All
stock options are granted with an exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair value of the Companys common stock at the date of grant. The options vest over periods of zero to six years and have a maximum term of 10 years. Following
shareholder approval of the 2005 Plan on November14, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors directed that no further grants of stock options or other awards would be made under the 1997 Plan. The foregoing action does not affect any
outstanding awards under the 1997 Plan, which remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

and 2004, respectively, with a weighted-average exercise price of $2648 and $2405. The aggregate intrinsic value of the Companys
in-the-money outstanding and exercisable options as of June30, 2006 was $3,047. The intrinsic value of the options exercised during fiscal year 2006 was $1,923. Nonvested common stock options are subject to the risk of forfeiture
until the fulfillment of specified conditions. As of June30, 2006, there was $16,623 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested options granted under the Companys stock plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over
a weighted-average period of 15 years from June30, 2006.

weighted-average period of 19 years from June30, 2006. The total fair value of nonvested restricted stock awards that vested during the year ended June30, 2006 was $0. EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN During 1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP and authorized 500,000 shares for future issuance. Under the plan, rights
are granted to purchase shares of common stock at 85% of the lesser of the market value of such shares at either the beginning or the end of each six-month offering period. The plan permits employees to purchase common stock through payroll
deductions, which may not exceed 10% of an employees compensation as defined in the plan. The number of shares issued under the ESPP during fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 90,807, 63,717 and 62,371, respectively. Shares available for
future purchase under the ESPP totaled 35,581 at June30, 2006. STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION The Company has several stock-based employee compensation plans. On July1, 2005, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payment, using the modified prospective method, which results in the provisions of SFAS 123R only being applied to the consolidated financial statements on a
going-forward basis that is, the prior period results were not restated. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as
expense over the service period. Stock-based employee compensation expense was $10,144 before tax for fiscal year 2006. Previously, the Company had followed Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations, which resulted in the accounting for employee share options at their intrinsic value in the consolidated financial statements. 
62 Table of Contents
The Company recognized the full impact of its share-based payment plans in the consolidated statements of
operations for fiscal year 2006 under SFAS 123R and did not capitalize any such costs on the consolidated balance sheets, as such costs that qualified for capitalization were not material. The following table presents share-based compensation
expenses included in the Companys consolidated statement of operations:  YearEnded June30,2006

for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No123 to stock-based employee awards.

The weighted-average grant-date fair values of options granted during fiscal years 2006, 2005 and
2004 were $1062, $1779 and $1508, respectively, per option. The fair value of options at date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:  Years Ended June30 2006 2005 2004 Option life
6years 6years 6years Risk-free interest rate
472 394 348 Stock volatility
53 73 76 Dividend rate
0 0 0 1
The option life was determined using the simplified method for estimating expected option life, which qualify as plain-vanilla options. 
63 Table of Contents 2
The risk-free interest rate for each grant is equal to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life. 3
The fiscal 2006 stock volatility for each grant is measured using the weighted average of historical daily price changes of the Companys common stock over the most recent
period equal to the expected option life of the grant, the historical short-term trend of the option and other factors, such as expected changes in volatility arising from planned changes in the Companys business operations.
The weighted-average fair value of stock purchase rights granted as part of the Companys ESPP during fiscal years
2006, 2005 and 2004 were $656, $729 and $674, respectively per right. The fair value of the employees stock purchase rights were estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:  Years Ended June30 2006 2005 2004 Option life

0 0 0 During the fiscal year 2006, the Company granted 610,516 shares of nonvested restricted common
stock to certain employees and officers as permitted under the 1997 and 2005 Stock Plans. These restricted stock grants either vest ratably in annual tranches over three years, four years or cliff vest after four years and are subject to forfeiture
if employment terminates during the prescribed retention period. Compensation expense for the number of shares issued is recognized ratably over the service period and is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of cost of
revenues, selling, general and administrative and research and development expense. During fiscal year 2006, $1,050 of compensation expense was recognized related to these restricted stock awards. In addition, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $0, $0 and $176 during fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, for stock
options granted to non-employees. Such amounts reflect the fair value of options upon their final vesting dates as well as adjustments for the revaluation of a portion of the unvested options at each period-end. The fair value of these non-employee
stock option grants was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. On June20, 2005, prior to the adoption of SFAS
123R, the Company accelerated the vesting of outstanding stock options granted to employees and officers with an exercise price of $2900 or greater. As a result, vesting was accelerated for options to purchase 552,097 shares of the Companys
common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $3221 and exercise prices per share ranging from $2926 to $4085, including options to purchase 51,565 shares held by the Companys executive officers and no options held by the
Companys non-employee directors. By taking this action, the Company reduced the amount of compensation expense recorded in subsequent, post-SFAS 123R, fiscal periods. No compensation expense was recorded in the Companys consolidated
statement of operations for the year ended June30, 2005 related to this action as these options had no intrinsic value on June20, 2005. For purposes of the SFAS No123 pro forma calculation above, the expense related to the options
that were accelerated was $63 million, net of tax, for the year ended June30, 2005.

included in the calculation of diluted net loss earnings per share for the year ended June30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, because the equity instruments were antidilutive. During the year ended June30, 2005, the Company adopted the guidance of Emerging Issue Task Force Issue No04-08 EITF 04-08,
The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings Per Share. The guidance requires the inclusion in diluted earnings per share calculations of the effect of notes that are contingently convertible into shares of common
stock, with restatement of reported amounts for periods prior to adoption. As a result of adoption, the calculations of diluted net income per share for the years ended June30, 2005 and 2004 iinclude 4,135,000 and 717,000 shares,
respectively, which represent the securities issuable under the Companys outstanding Convertible Senior Notes issued in fiscal year 2004 and iireflect increases to reported net income of $2,354 and $404 respectively, representing the
interest expense including amortization of deferred financing costs incurred, net of tax, related to the Convertible Senior Notes that would have not have been incurred had the notes been converted into common stock, as assumed per the
calculation. Further, for the year ended June30, 2006, the effect of the convertible debt would be antidilutive, thus the convertible debt had no impact on the dilutive net loss earnings per share calculation.

system in fiscal 2006 and has placed $1,734 into service through June30, 2006. The Company does not depreciate CIP until it is placed into service. H. Operating Segment, Significant Customers and Geographic Information Operating segments are defined as components of an
enterprise evaluated regularly by the Companys senior management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company has four operating and reportable segments which were determined based upon the nature of the products
offered to customers, the market characteristics of each operating segment and the Companys management structure:  Defense Business Unit Defense, formerly Defense Electronics Group This segment provides high-performance embedded computer systems as standard products to the defense
markets by using COTS and selected rugged components. This segment also provides customized design services to meet the specified requirements of a military application. During fiscal year 2006, the Company acquired Echotek Corporation and their
results are reported in this operating segment.  Commercial Imaging and Visualization Business Unit CIV, formerly Imaging and Visualization Solutions Group This segment provides high-performance embedded computer systems
and two-dimensional 2Dand three-dimensional 3Dimage processing and visualization software to the imaging and visualization market including life sciences medical imaging and biotechnology, geoscience earth sciences including oil
and gas exploration, and simulation commercial and defense. During fiscal year 2006, the Company acquired SoHard AG and their results are reported in this operating segment.  Advanced Solutions Business Unit Advanced Solutions, formerly OEM Solutions Group This segment provides a host of high-performance I/O bandwidth computer systems, services
and licenses of intellectual property for the semiconductor photomask generation, reticle inspection and wafer inspection, telecommunication, military and aerospace markets.  Modular Products and Services Business Unit MPS, formerly Momentum Computer Group This segment provides quick turn-around design for application-specific processor and
high-performance I/O boards for the telecommunications, military and aerospace markets. 
67 Table of Contents
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note B:
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The profitability measure employed by the Company and its chief operating decision maker for making decisions about allocating resources to segments and assessing segment performance is income loss
from operations prior to stock compensation expense. As such, stock compensation expense has been excluded from each operating segments income loss from operations below and reported separately to reconcile the reported segment income loss
from operations to the consolidated operating income reported in the consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, asset information by reportable segment is not reported because the Company does not produce such information internally. The

certain licensed technologies and the Companys acquisition of Myriad Logic, Inc., the TGS Group, Advanced Radio Corporation, Momentum Computer, Inc., SoHard AG and Echotek Corporation and consist of identifiable intangible assets, including
completed technology, licensing agreements, customer backlog and customer relationships. Acquired intangible assets are reported at cost, net of accumulated amortization and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of
up to six years. Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of the acquired net assets in a business acquisition exceeded the fair values of the identifiable assets on the date of purchase. In accordance with the requirements of SFAS No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not amortized; rather goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded
goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an
impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. In prior fiscal years, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the third fiscal quarter. In fiscal 2006, after the Companys goodwill impairment test was
completed in the third fiscal quarter, the Company changed the annual goodwill impairment test date to the fourth fiscal quarter to align with the Companys normal business process for updating the Companys strategic plan and forecasts,
which is finalized each year in the fourth fiscal quarter. As a result of this change in the method of applying an accounting principle, which the Company believes is preferable, the Company performed an additional goodwill impairment test in the
fourth fiscal quarter of 2006. The Company noted that neither the third nor fourth quarter tests resulted in the identification of any impairment. Further, the Company noted that this accounting change had no effect on current or prior period
results.

and an increase of $1,162 related to foreign currency translation adjustments. The increase in goodwill during fiscal year 2005 was
primarily the result of the Companys acquisition of Momentum Computer, Inc. see Note M to the consolidated financial statements which resulted in an increase of goodwill of $9,052, net of a reduction of $523 related to the net operating loss
carryforwards of MCI determined based on final tax returns. Offsetting these amounts is the foreign currency translation adjustment impact of $756 and two opening balance sheet adjustments totaling $206 recorded related to the TGS Group acquisition

In September 2005, the Company entered into an agreement to license certain technologies from a third
party for $2,000. The costs associated with the license agreement were capitalized as an intangible asset in accordance with FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and will be amortized over the estimated period that the Company
will receive an economic benefit from the intangible asset. Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets for the years ended
June30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $7,976, $2,353 and $914, respectively. Estimated future amortization expense for acquired intangible assets remaining at June30, 2006 is $7,585 for fiscal 2007, $7,585 for fiscal 2008, $3,958 for fiscal
2009, $2,354 for fiscal 2010, and $1,394 thereafter. J. Commitments and Contingencies LEGAL CLAIMS On January31, 2006, the Company received a written notice and request for indemnification from Seismic Micro-Technology, Inc. SMT, which had been named as a defendant in a patent infringement suit
entitled Landmark Graphics Corporation, et al. v. Paradigm Geophysical Corporation, et al., filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. SMT based its request for indemnification on the terms of certain
application developer agreements it entered into with the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The complaint alleges infringement by SMT of U.S. patent number 6,765,570, and seeks injunctive relief, treble damages, costs and attorneys
fees. On February22, 2006, SMT answered and filed counterclaims for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity. On February28, 2006 the Company notified SMT that it would indemnify SMT from all costs and damages that may be
awarded against SMT in the foregoing action, and would be responsible for attorneys fees and expenses incurred by SMT in defense of the action, subject to certain conditions, including the Companys right to control and direct the defense
of the action on behalf of SMT. The Company believes there are meritorious defenses to the complaint and the Company intends to contest it vigorously. However, an adverse resolution of this litigation could have an adverse effect on the
Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved. No amounts have been accrued for this loss contingency. The Company is also subject to other legal proceedings, claims and tax audits that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe
the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS The Companys standard product sales and license agreements entered
into in the ordinary course of business typically contain an indemnification provision pursuant to which the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party
in connection with any patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to the Companys products. Such provisions generally survive termination or expiration of the agreements. The potential
amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is, in some instances, unlimited PURCHASE COMMITMENTS In June 2005, the Company entered into an alliance
agreement with a third party to purchase certain computer equipment and services. This alliance agreement, as subsequently amended, is in effect until December 2011 and contains penalties for volume commitments and a variable early termination
penalty that generally decreases over time based upon purchases. Aggregate minimum purchase commitments over the six-year term of the agreement total $69,090. As of June30, 2006, the total early termination fee was $1,870. Further, this
71 Table of Contents
agreement requires payments of $2,000 related to the licensing of certain technology,$6,750 related to the development of certain technologies and
royalty payments based on future purchases capped at a maximum of $1,000 with a minimum of $200. Payments totaling $2,900 were made during fiscal 2006 in relation to this alliance agreement. In July 2005, the Company began an ERP system upgrade to improve our ERP system capabilities and processes. In connection with the implementation of the
ERP system upgrade, the Company entered into several agreements with a third-party relating to the initial phases of the implementation. As of June30, 2006, there was $549 of funds authorized that have not been expended related to the ERP
effort. As of June30, 2006, the Company has entered into non-cancelable purchase commitments for certain inventory components used
in its normal operations. The purchase commitments covered by these agreements are for less than one year and aggregate approximately $19,484. LEASE COMMITMENTS The Company leases certain facilities, machinery and
equipment under various cancelable and non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through fiscal 2013. The leases contain various renewal options. Rental charges are subject to escalation for increases in certain operating costs of
the lessor. For tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays, the Company records a deferred rent liability on the consolidated balance sheets and amortizes the deferred rent over the terms of the leases as reductions to rent expense on the
consolidated statements of operations. Rental expense during the years ended June30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $2,440, $1,780, and $1,100, respectively. Minimum lease payments under the Companys non-cancelable operating leases are as

Thereafter 362 Total minimum lease payments 6,313 K. Shareholders Equity PREFERRED STOCK The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $001 per share. SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN The Company has adopted a Shareholder
Rights Plan, the purpose of which is, among other things, to enhance the Boards ability to protect the shareholder interests and to ensure that shareholders receive fair treatment in the event any coercive takeover attempt of the Company is
made in the future. The Shareholder Rights Plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, the Company or a large block of the Companys common stock. The following summary
description of the Shareholder Rights Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Companys Shareholder Rights Plan, which has been previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an
exhibit to a Registration Statement on Form 8-A. 
72 Table of Contents
In connection with the adoption of the Shareholder Rights Plan, the Board of Directors of the Company
declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right a Right for each outstanding share of common stock to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December23, 2005. The Rights currently are not
exercisable and are attached to and trade with the outstanding shares of common stock. Under the Shareholder Rights Plan, the Rights become exercisable if a person becomes an acquiring person by acquiring 15% or more of the outstanding
shares of common stock or if a person commences a tender offer that would result in that person owning 15% or more of the common stock. If a person becomes an acquiring person, each holder of a Right other than the acquiring person
would be entitled to purchase, at the then-current exercise price, such number of shares of the Companys preferred stock which are equivalent to shares of common stock having a value of twice the exercise price of the Right. If the Company is
acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after any such event, each holder of a Right would then be entitled to purchase, at the then-current exercise price, shares of the acquiring companys common stock having a value of
twice the exercise price of the Right. STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM 
In July 2004, the Companys Board of Directors extended the share repurchase program through December 2005 and authorized an increase in the total
authorized dollar amount for repurchase then available to approximately $25,000. During fiscal year 2005, the Company repurchased 873,459 shares of its common stock, which completed the authorized purchase under this stock repurchase program.
In July2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a second share repurchase program for up to $20,000 of the
Companys currently outstanding common stock. This program is intended to offset the potential dilutive impact of the issuance of shares in connection with the Companys employee stock option and purchase plans. Repurchases of the
Companys common stock may be made from time to time at managements discretion on the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions. During fiscal 2006, 531,824 shares of common stock were repurchased
under this program for a total cost of $12,284. L. Product Warranty Liability All of the Companys product sales generally include a 12 or 18-month standard hardware warranty, with the exception of product sales in the MPS
segment, which generally include a three-year standard hardware warranty. At the time of product shipment, the Company accrues the estimated cost to repair or replace potentially defective products. Estimated warranty costs are based upon prior
actual warranty costs for substantially similar transactions. The following table presents the changes in the Companys product warranty liability for the years ended June30, 2006, 2005 and 2004:  Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Beginning balance at June30 1,620 1,135 925 Accruals for warranties issued during the period 5,044 2,398 2,147 Warranty liabilities assumed in acquisitions 101 25 Settlements made during the period 4,164 1,938 1,937 Ending balance at June30 2,601 1,620 1,135 The Company recorded $85 and $16, respectively, for the fair value of product warranty liabilities
assumed in connection with the acquisitions of Echotek Corporation and SoHard AG during the year ended June30, 2006.

M. Acquisitions As part of a continuing growth strategy, the Company, from time to time, may acquire interests, either partially or wholly, in businesses the Company deems to be at favorable market prices. The Company generally
attempts to make acquisitions from which it can expand its breadth of product offerings, increase its market share and/or realize sales and marketing synergies. TGS Group On May6, 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of TGS Group TGS Group. TGS
Group is a leading supplier of three-dimensional 3Dimage processing and visualization software to diverse end markets including life sciences medical imaging and biotechnology, geoscience earth sciences including oil and gas exploration,
and simulation commercial and defense. TGS Group is headquartered in Bordeaux, France, has operations in Berlin, Germany and San Diego, California and has sales offices in Italy and the United Kingdom. The results of TGS Groups operations
have been included in the consolidated financial statements since May6, 2004. The initial purchase price of TGS Group consisted of
cash of $12,880 as well as 257,511 shares of the Companys common stock. As of June30, 2004, the Company had paid $9,438 of the cash consideration and had not yet issued the required shares of common stock due to a dispute with the
sellers regarding the determination of the final purchase price. Also as of that date, the Company had recorded $7,512 as a current liability and $630 as a long-term other liability for the expected remaining purchase price payable to the former TGS
Group shareholders. As a result, as June30, 2004, the Company had recorded a preliminary TGS Group purchase price of $19,302, including $1,722 of transaction costs directly related to the acquisition. The initial purchase price as of the acquisition date was allocated based on the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed as follows:
Accounts receivable 1,315 Property and equipment 287 Other assets 1,179 Acquired intangible assets customer relationships, completed technology and licensing agreement 3,520 Goodwill 19,142 Current liabilities 5,022 Short-term notes payable repaid subsequent to acquisition date 897 Deferred tax liabilities, net 222 19,302 In December 2004, the Company entered into an agreement with the former shareholders of TGS Group
which finalized the purchase price for the acquisition and, as a result, paid $2,812 in cash and issued 206,554 shares of the Companys common stock valued at $4,813, representing the final payment of purchase price. The final purchase price of
$19,415 for the acquisition of TGS Group consisted of total cash payments of $12,880, 206,554 shares of the Companys common stock valued at $4,813, and $1,722 of transaction costs directly related to the acquisition. The finalization of the
purchase price resulted in a $113 increase to goodwill recorded. This transaction resulted in an amount of purchase price that exceeded
the estimated fair values of tangible and intangible assets, which was allocated to goodwill. The Company believes that the high amount of goodwill relative to identifiable intangible assets was the result of two factors: 1the overall
rationale for the transaction, which was to gain entry into the 3D medical image processing market by combining the acquired technology of TGS Group with that of the Company, in order to move from 2D image processing to an integrated 3D 
74 Table of Contents
application layer product and offer this product to the Companys existing customers; and 2the buyer-specific synergies of expected additional
revenues and associated profits, resulting from the integration of the Companys and TGS Groups technology and the exploitation of this technology primarily with the Companys customers. In addition, at the acquisition date, TGS
Group had a working capital deficit, which caused the Company to acquire net liabilities of approximately $34 million excluding intangible assets and had the direct effect of increasing the amount of recorded goodwill by a corresponding amount.
The amortization period for the acquired intangible assets subject to amortization is five years. The goodwill and other intangible assets
associated with the acquisition are not deductible for tax purposes. The pro forma statements reflecting the operating results of TGS
Group and the Company as if TGS Group had been acquired as of July1, 2003 would not differ materially from the operating results of the Company as reported. Advanced Radio Corporation On June1, 2004, Mercury completed its acquisition of Advanced Radio
Corporation ARC. ARC is a developer of radio frequency RF products used in signals intelligence SIGINT applications and commercial opportunities such as wireless infrastructure testing. The total purchase price of $6,760 consisted of $6,603 in
cash plus $157 of transaction costs directly related to the acquisition. The transaction also includes contingent payments of up to an aggregate of $1,500 in cash payable over three years, which will be treated recorded as compensation expense if
and as it is incurred. The results of ARCs operations have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements since June1, 2004. The purchase price as of the acquisition date was allocated based on the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed as follows:  Other assets 76 Property and equipment 82 Inventory 299 Acquired intangible assets completed technology 770 In-process research and development 500 Deferred tax assets, net 131 Goodwill 5,642 Current liabilities 339 Short-term notes payable repaid subsequent to the acquisition date 401 6,760 In connection with the acquisition of ARC, the Company obtained an appraisal of the fair value of
its intangible assets. This appraisal valued at $500 in-process research and development IPRD of two projects for the development of new products and technologies. Because the technological feasibility of these products under development had
not been established and no future alternative uses existed, the purchased IPRD was expensed at the acquisition date and recorded in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The value of the
purchased IPRD was determined using the residual income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value. Each project was analyzed to determine the technological innovations
included; the utilization of core technology; the complexity, cost and time to complete development; any alternative future use or current technological feasibility; and the stage of completion. This transaction resulted in an amount of purchase price that exceeded the estimated fair values of tangible and intangible assets, which was allocated
to goodwill. The Company believes that the high amount of goodwill 
75 Table of Contents
relative to identifiable intangible assets relates to several factors including: 1the Companys willingness to pay for potential buyer-specific
synergies related to market opportunities for combined existing product offering; 2the Companys ability to protect its existing competitive advantages within certain product lines of its Defense Electronics Group; and 3the
potential to continue developing next-generation technologies from the acquired workforce. The amortization period for the acquired
intangible assets subject to amortization is five years. The goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the acquisition are not deductible for tax purposes. The pro forma statements reflecting the operating results of ARC as if ARC had been acquired as of July1, 2003 would not differ materially from the operating results of the Company as reported. Momentum Computer, Inc. On
September30, 2004, the Company acquired a 35% voting interest in Momentum Computer, Inc. MCI, a manufacturer and developer of high-performance embedded processor and I/O boards, for $3,087, which was recorded at that time as an investment in
an unconsolidated entity. On December7, 2004, the Company acquired the remaining 65% voting interest in MCI in a separately negotiated transaction, paying $10,500 in cash and agreeing to pay up to $12,000 of additional cash consideration if
specified operating income and revenue targets are achieved by MCI over 24 months following the closing. Any such additional payments will be recorded as additional goodwill if and when incurred. The acquisition of MCI has been accounted for in accordance with SFAS No141, Business Combinations. The total purchase price for the
acquisition of MCI was $13,790, consisting of cash payments of $13,587, and transaction costs of $203 directly related to the acquisition. The results of MCIs operations have been included in the Companys consolidated financial
statements since December7, 2004. Prior to that date, the Company recorded its pro rata share of MCIs net operating results under the equity method of accounting. The purchase price as of December7, 2004 was allocated based upon the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed as follows:
Cash 388 Accounts receivable 1,157 Property and equipment 452 Other assets 192 Inventory 1,975 Customer relationships 1,900 Customer backlog 549 Goodwill 9,575 Current liabilities 1,759 Short-term notes payable repaid subsequent to acquisition date 500 Deferred tax liabilities, net 139 13,790 This transaction resulted in an amount of purchase price that exceeded the estimated fair values
of tangible and intangible assets, which was allocated to goodwill. The Company believes that the high amount of goodwill relative to identifiable intangible assets was the result of several factors including: 1the Companys ability to
gain protection against competition and to mitigate loss of market share at the low end of the market through expanded product and service offerings; 2the Companys intentions to utilize its financial stability and market presence to
attract new customers that were not then customers of MCI; and 3buyer-related synergies resulting from the Companys leverage of its sales force and intellectual property to attract new contracts and revenue. 
76 Table of Contents
The acquired intangible assets, other than goodwill, will be amortized over their estimated useful lives
of six years for customer relationships and four months for customer backlog. The goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the acquisition are not deductible for tax purposes. Pro forma financial information reflecting the operating results of MCI and the Company as if MCI had been acquired as of July1, 2003 would not
differ materially from the operating results of the Company, as reported. SoHard AG On July1, 2005, the Company acquired SoHard AG SoHard for a purchase price of $23,294 including direct transaction costs of $1,003. SoHard is a
market leader in the development of advanced software solutions for medical imaging systems, hardware and firmware for commercial embedded systems and software intelligence applications delivered via professional services. SoHard is headquartered in
Fuerth, Germany. The results of SoHards operations have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements since July1, 2005. The acquisition of SoHard was accounted for in accordance with SFAS No141, Business Combinations. The purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based
on estimates of their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Fair values of intangible assets were determined by management using the assistance of independent third-party appraisals. The tangible long-lived assets were valued using the
cost approach, while the intangible long-lived assets were valued using a discounted cash flow method. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities was allocated to goodwill.
Goodwill and intangible assets recognized in this transaction are not deductible for tax purposes. The Company believes that the high amount of goodwill relative to identifiable intangible assets relates to several factors including: 1the
Companys willingness to pay for potential buyer-specific synergies related to market opportunities for combined existing and future product offering; 2the Companys ability to protect its existing competitive advantages within
certain product lines of its Commercial Imaging and Visualization Business Unit; and 3the potential to sell Mercury products to existing SoHard customers. The purchase price as of July1, 2005 was allocated based upon the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed as follows:  Cash 888 Accounts receivable 1,180 Inventory 287 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 570 Property and equipment 418 Customer relationships 3,300 Other acquired intangible assets customer backlog, non-compete and technology 2,350 In-process research and development 450 Goodwill 17,157 Current liabilities 1,916 Current portion of long-term notes payable 36 Deferred tax liabilities, net 751 Long-term notes payable 603 23,294 
77 Table of Contents
The purchase price allocation was finalized in fiscal 2006, upon completion of the fair-value appraisals
of intangible assets and final assessment of the fair values of certain assumed assets and liabilities. As of June30, 2006, there
was approximately $532 of unpaid purchase price related to the SoHard acquisition. This liability is accrued and recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in accrued expenses and is expected to be paid by July 2006. In-process research and development IPRD consisted of one project under development at the acquisition date. Because the technological feasibility
of this project had not been established and no future alternative uses existed, the purchased IPRD was expensed at the acquisition date in the consolidated statement of operations. The value of the purchased IPRD was determined using the
residual income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value. Each project was analyzed to determine the technological innovations included; the utilization of core technology; the
complexity, cost and time to complete development; any alternative future use or current technological feasibility; and the stage of completion. The amortization periods for the acquired intangible assets subject to amortization are as follows:  Customer relationships

On August31, 2005, the Company purchased Echotek Corporation Echotek for a purchase price of $50,274 including direct
transaction costs of $368. The purchase price excluding transaction costs was paid in a combination of cash totaling $44,734 and 177,132 shares of Mercury common stock. The 177,132 shares of common stock were valued at $5,172 based on the average
closing price of the Companys common stock for the five-day period including two days before and after July12, 2005, the date the Company executed the related merger agreement and announced the transaction. Based in Huntsville, Alabama,
Echotek is a market leader in the development of data acquisition products. The results of Echoteks operations have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements since September1, 2005. The acquisition of Echotek was accounted for in accordance with SFAS No141, Business Combinations. The purchase price of the acquisition
was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Fair values of intangible assets were determined management using the assistance of independent third-party
appraisals. The tangible long-lived assets were valued using the cost approach, while the intangible long-lived assets were valued using a discounted cash flow method. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible
and intangible assets and liabilities was allocated to goodwill. Goodwill and intangible assets recognized in this transaction are not deductible for tax purposes. The Company believes that the high amount of goodwill relative to identifiable
intangible assets relates to several factors including: 1the Companys willingness to pay for potential buyer-specific synergies related to market opportunities for combined existing and future product offering; 2the
Companys intentions to utilize its financial stability and market presence to attract new customers that were not then customers of Echotek; and 3the potential to continue developing next-generation technologies from the acquired
workforce.

convert the Notes or require the Company to repurchase the Notes. The holders may also require the Company to repurchase the Notes, in whole or in part, on May1, 2009, 2014 or 2019 or if the Companys common stock is neither listed nor
approved for trading on specified markets. Upon issuance of the Notes, the Company received net proceeds of $120,889 after offering
expenses of $4,111, which were recorded as deferred financing costs in other long-term assets on the balance sheet and are being amortized over the five-year term to May1, 2009, the first optional redemption date of the debt. For the year
ended June30, 2006 and 2005, additional interest expense from the amortization of these deferred financing costs totaled $840 and $855, respectively. The unamortized balance of deferred financing costs totaled approximately $2,397 and $3,237
at June30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Mortgage Notes Payable In November 1999, the Company completed a lending agreement with a commercial financing company, issuing two 730% senior secured financing notes the
Mortgage Notes due November 2014. The original principal amount of the Mortgage Notes totaled $14,500. The Mortgage Notes are collateralized by the Companys corporate headquarters, which consists of two buildings. The terms of the Mortgage
Notes contained certain covenants, which, among other provisions, require the Company to maintain a specified minimum tangible net worth on November2nd of each year. The Mortgage Notes also include significant prepayment penalties. The outstanding principal amount on the Mortgage Notes was $9,997 and $10,828 at June30, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. On October19, 2005, the Company obtained a temporary waiver from the holders of the Mortgage Notes, effective through
December31, 2005, for the Companys non-compliance with the minimum tangible net worth ratio covenant as of November2, 2005. This non-compliance was largely the result of the intangible assets capitalized as a result of two
businesses acquired by the Company during the nine months ended March31, 2006. On December22, 2005, the Company amended certain financial covenants relating to the Mortgage Notes. Pursuant to the amendments, the minimum tangible net
worth covenant was replaced with new financial covenants relating to the maintenance of an interest coverage ratio, certain leverage ratios and a minimum consolidated net worth. The amendments also permanently waived any non-compliance with the
superseded minimum tangible net worth covenant as of November2, 2005. The Company was not in compliance with the consolidated
interest expense to EBIT and consolidated indebtedness to EBITDA covenants as of March31, 2006. This non-compliance was largely due to the impact of the third quarter 2006 losses on the covenant ratios. On April21, 2006, the Company
obtained a temporary waiver from the holders of the Mortgage Notes, effective through July15, 2006, for the Companys non-compliance with these covenants, after which time the Company would be required to meet these covenants. Management
expects, however, that the Company will not be in compliance with the covenants as currently structured after July15, 2006. Accordingly, the Company has reclassified its Mortgage Notes from long-term to current as of June30, 2006. If a
new agreement cannot be reached or if an agreement is reached but the covenants are not attainable and the Mortgage Note holders were to exercise their rights, the Company would be required to repay the outstanding principal, accrued interest plus
the prepayment penalty which as of June30, 2006 would be approximately $594. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of
the Mortgage Notes as of June30, 2005. Other Notes Payable As of June30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, the Company had other notes payable totaling approximately $697 and $63 consisting of government loans to
foreign subsidiaries and other foreign debt. The interest rate on the other notes payable ranges from 0% to 712%.

The components of the Companys net deferred tax assets were as follows:  June30 2006 2005 Deferred tax assets Receivable allowances and inventory valuations 4,916 2,232 Accrued compensation 1,660 1,350 Equity compensation 2,466 Property and equipment depreciation 224 State research and development tax credit carryforwards 5,341 4,170 Net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards of acquired businesses 6,363 Other temporary differences 1,947 3,505 22,917 11,257 Valuation allowance 8,887 1,667 Total deferred tax assets 14,030 9,590 Deferred tax liabilities Property and equipment depreciation 144 Acquired intangible assets 8,165 2,095 Other temporary differences 567 206 Total deferred tax liabilities 8,732 2,445 Net deferred tax assets 5,298 7,145 In fiscal 2006, the Company recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities of approximately $1,190
and $9,044, respectively, in connection with the acquisitions of SoHard and Echotek. During fiscal 2006, management determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets acquired in the SoHard acquisition would not be utilized in
the foreseeable future due to uncertainties surrounding the timing and amounts of future taxable income of SoHard. As a result, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $646. At June30, 2006, the Company had Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $5,977. The Company also had Federal and state
research and development credit carryforwards of $485 and $5,341, respectively, which will begin to expire in 2007 and 2015, respectively. As of June 30, 2006 the Company also had approximately $10,210 in foreign net operating loss carryforwards.
During fiscal 2006, the Company determined that it is more likely than not it will not utilize these Federal and state research and development credits in the foreseeable future. As a result, a valuation allowance of approximately $5,826 was
recorded against the deferred tax asset relating to the credits. During fiscal year 2006, the Companys valuation allowance increased
by an additional $748 as a result of additional net operating losses incurred by the TGS Group. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that these losses will not be utilized in the foreseeable future. In fiscal 2005, the Company recorded deferred tax assets of $1,255, and deferred tax liabilities of $684 in connection with the acquisition of MCI. The
Company did not establish any valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets acquired as part of this acquisition as such tax assets are expected to be realized in combination with the Companys future taxable income. Our ability to use the
net operating loss carryforwards may be limited under U.S. tax laws, specifically section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company
files income tax returns in all jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company has established reserves to provide for additional income taxes that may be due in future years as these previously filed tax returns are audited. These reserves have
been established based upon managements assessment as to the potential exposure attributable to permanent differences. All tax reserves are analyzed quarterly and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant modification.

On October22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act was signed into
law. The Act created a temporary incentive for U.S. multinationals to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the U.S. at an effective tax rate of 525%. On November15, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued proposed
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No109-2, Accounting and Disclosure for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. SFAS No109-2 would allow companies
additional time to evaluate the effect of the law on whether unrepatriated foreign earnings continue to qualify for SFAS No109s exception to recognizing deferred tax liabilities and would require explanatory disclosures from those
companies who need the additional time. Through June30, 2006 the Company had not provided deferred taxes on foreign earnings because such earnings were intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. The cumulative amount of
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which is intended to be permanently reinvested and for which U.S. income taxes have not been provided, totaled approximately $2,697 and $2,200 at June30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 
P. Restructuring Provision In response to lower
than expected demand in certain sectors of the Companys business, as well as the need to maintain a competitive cost structure and integrate the Companys previous acquisitions, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $2,142
related to the Companys 2006 restructuring plan the 2006 Plan. The 2006 Plan included $2,065 related to involuntary separation costs for 55employees, $25 for a facility closure and $52 for other costs primarily legal costs. All of
these expenses were principally in the Defense and Commercial Imaging and Visualizations business units with a modest amount in the Advanced Solutions and Modular Products and Services business units. The restructuring charges are classified as
operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and are expected to be paid within the next 12-months. The remaining restructuring liability is classified as accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets.

range from 1% to 15% of eligible compensation. During fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company matched employee contributions up to 3% of eligible compensation. The Company may also make optional contributions to the plan for any plan year at
its discretion. Expense recognized by the Company for matching contributions related to the 401k plan was $1,963, $1,789 and $736 during the years ended June30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

generally based on years of service and compensation history. This plan is unfunded. As of June30, 2006 and 2005, the unfunded liability of the Pension
Plan was $418 and $316, respectively which is recorded as accrued compensation in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company has a
deferred compensation plan that allows eligible employees to defer up to 35% of their total compensation. The employee may elect to receive his or her account balance as a lump sum payment or as an annuity to be paid over a period not to exceed 10
years beginning upon retirement or termination of employment. At June30, 2006 and 2005, the Company had a liability of $1,563 and $1,281, respectively, relating to amounts owed under the deferred compensation plan that were classified as
long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and had an asset of $1,306 and $1,136, respectively, classified as other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Increases or decreases in the value of the deferred compensation
plan assets are recorded as selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations, while increases or decreases in the value of the deferred compensation plan liabilities are recorded as other income expense.

The Companys financial instruments include cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, Company-owned employee life insurance policies, mortgage notes payable and convertible notes. The carrying amount of cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their
fair value due to their short maturities. The carrying amount of Company-owned life insurance policies are recorded at cash surrender value, which approximates fair value while the carrying value of notes payable approximates fair value based on
borrowing rates currently available to the Company for the mortgage notes payable. The fair value of the convertible debt and other debt
was based upon either an estimation using an estimate of the interest rate the Company would have had to pay on the issuance of debt with similar maturity and discounting the cash flows at that rate or quoted market prices of the debt or debt with
similar characteristics. T.Subsequent Events Restructuring In response to lower than expected demand in certain sectors of the Companys business, as well as the
need to maintain a competitive cost structure and integrate the Companys Myriad Logic, Inc. acquisition during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, the Company incurred a restructuring charge of approximately $700 that will be recorded
related to the Companys 2007 restructuring plan the 2007 Plan. The 2007 Plan included approximately $634 related to involuntary separation and retention costs for 12employees, approximately $65 related to the abandonment of an
