REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.
Eden Prairie, MN We have audited the internal control over
financial reporting of C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Transera International
Holdings, Ltd., which was acquired on August1, 2008, and whose financial statements constitute less than 1% and 2% of net and total assets, respectively, less than 1% of revenues, and less than 1% of net income of the consolidated financial
statement amounts as of and for the year ended December31, 2008. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Transera International Holdings, Ltd. The Companys management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to
the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on the criteria established in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at  as of and for the year ended December31, 2008, of the
Company, and our report dated February25, 2009, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BASIS OF PRESENTATION. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. and
our subsidiaries the company, we, us, or our are a global provider of multimodal transportation services and logistics solutions through a network of 228 branch offices operating in North America,
Europe, Asia, South America, and the Middle East. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. and our majority owned and controlled subsidiaries. Our minority interests in subsidiaries are not
significant. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. USE OF ESTIMATES. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. We are also
required to disclose contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our ultimate results could differ from those estimates. REVENUE RECOGNITION. Gross revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers. Gross profits are gross revenues less
the direct costs of transportation, products, and handling. We act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered. At that time, our obligations to the
transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured. EITF Issue No99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, establishes the criteria for recognizing revenues on a gross or net basis. Most
transactions in our Transportation and Sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell. In these transactions, we are the primary obligor, we are a principal to the
transaction, we have all credit risk, we maintain substantially all risks and rewards, we have discretion to select the supplier, and we have latitude in pricing decisions. Additionally, in our Sourcing business, we take loss of inventory risk
during shipment and have general inventory risk. Certain transactions in customs brokerage, transportation management, and all transactions in Information Services are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide
because many of the factors stated above are not present. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for
amounts that may become uncollectible in the future. We continuously monitor payments from our customers and maintain a provision for uncollectible accounts based upon our customer aging trends, historical loss experience, and any specific customer
collection issues that we have identified. FOREIGN CURRENCY. Most balance sheet accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated or remeasured at
the current exchange rate as of the end of the year. Statement of operations items are translated at average exchange rates during the year. The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a separate component of comprehensive income in our
statement of stockholders investment. SEGMENT REPORTING AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION. We have adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No131, Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No131 establishes accounting standards for segment reporting. We operate in the transportation and logistics industry. We provide a wide range of products and services to our customers and carriers including transportation
services, produce sourcing, freight consolidation, contract warehousing, and information services. Each of these is a significant component to optimizing the logistics solution for our customers. These services are performed throughout our branch offices by the same group of people, as an integrated offering for which our customers are typically provided a single
invoice. Our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers. Approximately 35 percent of our truckload transactions are shared transactions between branches. For many of our significant customer
relationships, we coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs. In addition, our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches. Our North American
branches have a common technology platform that they use to match customer needs with supplier capabilities, to collaborate with other branch locations, and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction.
Accordingly, our chief operating decision maker analyzes our business as a single segment relying on gross profits and operating income for each of our branch offices as the primary performance measures.

Other locations 12,044 8,116 8,015 128,313 127,399 107,111 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of tax exempt and treasury money
market funds with an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments. PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER. Prepaid expenses and other include such items as prepaid rent, software maintenance contracts, insurance premiums, other prepaid operating expenses, and inventories, consisting primarily of produce and
related products held for resale. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Maintenance and repair expenditures are
charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets of 3 to 30 years. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated
useful lives of the improvements. We recognized depreciation expense of $207 million in 2008, $184 million in 2007, and $165 million in 2006. A summary
of our property and equipment as of December31 is as follows in thousands:  2008 2007 Furniture, fixtures, and equipment 110,229 108,909 Buildings 40,051 38,460 Corporate aircraft 9,037 9,000 Leasehold improvements 10,523 9,486 Land 14,327 13,374 Construction in progress 7,440 459 Less accumulated depreciation 87,519 78,023 Net property and equipment 104,088 101,665 INTANGIBLE ASSETS. Goodwill is the difference between the purchase price of a company and the fair market
value of the acquired companys net identifiable assets. Other intangible assets include customer lists, carrier lists, and non-competition agreements. These intangible assets are being amortized using the straight-line method over their
estimated lives, ranging from three to five years. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment using a fair value approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant. Intangible assets are evaluated
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. See Note 4. OTHER ASSETS.
Other assets include such items as purchased and internally developed software, and the investments related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan. We recognized amortization expense of purchased and internally developed software of $43
million in 2008, $31 million in 2007, and $34 million in 2006. We amortize software using the straight-line method over three years. 
36 Table of Contents
A summary of our purchased and internally developed software as of December31 is as follows in thousands:
2008 2007 Purchased software 20,801 19,169 Internally developed software 5,151 4,438 Less accumulated amortization 18,966 14,993 Net software 6,986 8,614 INCOME TAXES. Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates. Annual tax provisions include amounts considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns; however, the amount ultimately
paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued. The financial statement effects of an uncertain income tax position are
recognized when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. Other tax contingencies are accrued for when it is probably that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and
the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated. The current portion of uncertain income tax positions is included in Income taxes and other and the long-term portion is included in Noncurrent income taxes payable
in the consolidated balance sheets. Provisions are made for taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. Comprehensive income includes any changes in the equity of an enterprise from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner
sources. Our two components of other comprehensive income are foreign currency translation adjustment and unrealized gains and losses from investments. They are presented on our consolidated statements of stockholders investment. 
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. We account for share-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No123R, Share Based Payment. Under this standard, the
fair value of each share-based payment award is established on the date of grant. For grants of restricted shares and restricted units, the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant, discounted for post-vesting
holding restrictions. The discounts have varied from 12 to 22 percent and are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Increased stock price volatility is the primary factor that has caused the change in the discount applied.
For grants of options, we use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards. The determination of the
fair value of share-based awards is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. NOTE 2: RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This
Statement applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the FASB having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, this
Statement does not require any new fair value measurements. We adopted SFAS No157 on January1, 2008 for financial assets and liabilities. SFAS No157 did not have any impact on our financial statements. See Note 5 of Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position 157-2 which is a partial deferral of the
effective date of SFAS No157 as it relates to non-financial assets and liabilities. With respect to non-financial assets and liabilities, SFAS No157 is effective for us starting in fiscal 2009. We have not determined the impact, if
any, the adoption of this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements as it pertains to non-financial assets and liabilities. In February
2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No159 gives us the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair values, with changes in
fair value recognized in earnings. We adopted SFAS No159 on January1, 2008. We have elected not to report any financial assets or liabilities at fair value under SFAS No159. 
37 Table of Contents
In December 2007 the FASB issued SFAS No141R, Business Combinations. SFAS No141R establishes
principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. The statement also
provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business
combination. We adopted SFAS No141R as of January1, 2009. We expect SFAS No141R may have an impact on our consolidated financial statements but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature, terms
and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date. NOTE 3: AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES Our investments consist of investment-grade marketable debt securities. These investments, are classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because
these securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. All are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value. The carrying value of available-for-sale securities approximates fair market value. As
of December31, 2008 and 2007, we had $26 million and $1158 million in available-for-sale securities. Unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded, net of any tax effect, as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material as of December31, 2008 and 2007. The gross realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities were not material for the years ended
December31, 2008, 2007, and 2006. The fair value of available-for-sale debt securities at December31, 2008, by contractual maturity, is shown

an earn-out payment related to a previous acquisition. Additions to goodwill were partially offset by a $04 million purchase accounting adjustment to reflect the fair value of intangible assets acquired in 2007. In accordance with SFAS No142, we annually complete an impairment test on goodwill. This impairment test did not result in any impairment losses. A summary of our other intangible assets, which include primarily non-competition agreements and customer relationships, as of December31 is as follows in

157 establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for
substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based upon our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset or liabilitys classification within the
hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table presents information as
of December31, 2008 about our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, according to the valuation techniques we used to determine their fair values.  QuotedPricesin ActiveMarketsLevel 1

The estimated fair values of debt securities held as available-for-sale are based on quoted market prices and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and the transactions in establishing the prices. NOTE 6: LINES OF CREDIT We have 35million Euros available
under a line of credit at an interest rate of 665 percent Euribor plus 45 basis points at December31, 2008. This discretionary line of credit has no expiration date. Our credit agreement contains certain financial covenants, but does not
restrict the payment of dividends. We were in compliance with all covenants of this agreement as of December31, 2008. NOTE 7: INCOME TAXES 
C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. and its 80 percent or more owned U.S. subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. We file unitary or
separate state returns based on state filing requirements. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to audits of U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax returns before 2005.

We adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on
January1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of Interpretation 48, we recognized a $26 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as an increase to the January1, 2007 balance of
retained earnings. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, net of interest and penalties, is as follows in thousands:  2008 2007 Unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of the period 7,622 5,603 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 1,635 1,942 Additions for tax positions of prior years 15 592 Reductions for tax positions of prior years 1,512 515 Settlements 546 Unrecognized tax benefits, end of the period 7,214 7,622 As of December31, 2008, we had $99 million of unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would affect our
effective tax rate if recognized. We are not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefit will significantly increase or decrease in the next twelve months. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes. During the years ended December31, 2008, 2007, and 2006,
we recognized approximately $07 million, $10 million, and $06 million in interest and penalties. We had approximately $27 million and $26 million for the payment of interest and penalties accrued within noncurrent taxes payable as of
December31, 2008 and 2007. These amounts are not included in the reconciliation above. The components of the provision for income taxes consist of

PREFERRED STOCK. Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $10 per share.
There are no shares of Preferred Stock outstanding. The Preferred Stock may be issued by resolution of our Board of Directors at any time without any action of the stockholders. The Board of Directors may issue the Preferred Stock in one or more
series and fix the designation and relative powers. These include voting powers, preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations, and restrictions of each series. The issuance of any such series may have an adverse effect on the rights of holders
of Common Stock and may impede the completion of a merger, tender offer, or other takeover attempt. COMMON STOCK. Our Certificate of Incorporation
authorizes 480,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $10 per share. Subject to the rights of Preferred Stock which may from time to time be outstanding, holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends out of funds legally available,
when and if declared by the Board of Directors, and to receive their share of the net assets of the company legally available for distribution upon liquidation or dissolution. For each share of Common Stock held, stockholders are entitled to one vote on each matter to be voted on by the stockholders, including the election of directors. Holders of Common Stock are not entitled to cumulative
voting; the holders of more than 50 percent of the outstanding Common Stock can elect all of any class of directors if they choose to do so. The stockholders do not have preemptive rights. All outstanding shares of Common Stock are fully paid and
nonassessable. STOCK AWARD PLANS. Effective January1, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payment. Under SFAS 123R, stock-based
compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. We had previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 in January 2004, using the retroactive
restatement method. Total compensation expense recognized in our statements of operations for stock-based compensation awards was $208 million in 2008, $380 million in 2007, and $473 million in 2006. Our 1997 Omnibus Stock Plan allows us to grant certain stock awards, including stock options at fair market value and restricted shares and units, to our key employees
and outside directors. A maximum of 28,000,000 shares can be granted under this plan; 8,676,000 shares were available for stock awards as of December31, 2008, which cover stock options and restricted stock awards. Awards that expire or are
cancelled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the plans. The contractual lives of all options as originally granted
are ten years. Options vest over a five-year period from the date of grant, with none vesting the first year and one quarter vesting each year after that. Recipients are able to exercise options using a stock swap which results in a new,
fully-vested restoration option with a grant price established based on the date of the swap, and a remaining contractual life equal to the remaining life of the original option. Options issued to non-employee directors vest immediately. The fair
value per option is established using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, with the resulting expense being recorded over the vesting period of the award. Other than restoration options, we have not issued any new stock options since 2003. As of
December31, 2008, there was no unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options since all outstanding options were fully vested.

We have awarded performance-based restricted shares and restricted units to
certain key employees and non-employee directors. These restricted shares and restricted units are subject to certain vesting requirements over a five-year period, based on the operating performance of the company. The awards also contain
restrictions on the awardees ability to sell or transfer vested shares or units for a specified period of time. The fair value of these shares is established based on the market price on the date of grant, discounted for post-vesting holding
restrictions. The discount has ranged from 12 to 22 percent based on the different post-vesting holding restrictions. This discount was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Increased stock price volatility is the primary factor
that has caused the change in the discount applied. These grants are being expensed based on the terms of the awards. The following table summarizes our
nonvested performance-based restricted stock grants as of December31, 2008:  NumberofRestrictedShares and Units

3,193,232 3887 The fair value of restricted stock vested during 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $165 million, $273 million, and $330
million. We have also awarded restricted shares and units to certain key employees that vest primarily based on their continued employment. The value of
these awards is established by the market price on the date of the grant and is being expensed over the vesting period of the award. As of
December31, 2008, there is unrecognized compensation expense of $1305 million related to previously granted restricted equity. The amount of future expense to be recognized will be based on company performance and other certain conditions.
We have also issued to certain key employees restricted units which are fully vested upon issuance and contain restrictions on the awardees ability
to sell or transfer vested units for a specified period of time. The fair value of these shares is established using the same method discussed above. These grants have been expensed during the year they were earned by employees.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. Our 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan allows our employees to contribute up to
$10,000 of their annual cash compensation to purchase company stock. Purchase price is determined using the closing price on the last day of the quarter discounted by 15 percent. Shares are vested immediately. Employees purchased approximately
230,000, 220,000, and 206,000 shares of our Common Stock under this plan at an aggregate cost of $105 million, $95 million, and $83 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS. During 1999, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program that allows management to repurchase 8,000,000 shares for reissuance upon the exercise of employee stock
options and other stock plans. We purchased 3,221,300 and 1,926,500 of our common stock for the treasury at an aggregate cost of $1639 million and $853 million in 2007 and 2006 under this stock repurchase plan. There are no shares remaining for
repurchase under this authorization. During 2007, the Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase an additional 10,000,000 shares under the
program for reissuance upon the exercise of employee stock options and other stock plans. We purchased 62,700 shares of our common stock for the treasury at an aggregate cost of $34 million under this stock repurchase program in 2007. We purchased
3,720,000 shares of our common stock for the treasury at an aggregate cost of $2008 million in 2008. There are approximately 62million shares remaining for repurchase under this program. NOTE 9: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.
We offer a defined contribution profit-sharing and savings plan which qualifies under section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code and covers all eligible U.S. employees. Annual profit-sharing contributions are determined by our Board of
Directors, in accordance with the provisions of the plan. We can also elect to make matching contributions to the plan at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Profit-sharing plan expense, including matching contributions, was approximately
$300 million in 2008, $303 million in 2007, and $273 million in 2006. NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN. The Robinson Companies
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan provides certain employees the opportunity to defer a specified percentage or dollar amount of their cash and stock compensation. Participants may elect to defer up to 100 percent of their cash compensation.
The accumulated benefit obligation was $09 million and $12 million as of December31, 2008 and December31, 2007, respectively. We have purchased investments to fund the future liability. The investments had an aggregate market value of
$09 million as of December31, 2008 and $12 million as of December31, 2007, and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, all restricted shares granted but not yet delivered are also held within this
plan. LEASE COMMITMENTS. We lease certain facilities and equipment under operating leases. Lease expense was $321 million for 2008, $269 million
for 2007, and $222 million for 2006. Minimum future lease commitments under noncancelable lease agreements in excess of one year as of December31,

certain gender discrimination class claims were settled in 2006. The settlement was within our insurance coverage limits, and was fully funded by insurance. Although insurance fully funded the gender class settlement, those insurers reserved the right to seek a court ruling that a portion of the settlement was not covered under their policies, and also to dispute payment of certain defense
costs incurred in that litigation. Insurance coverage litigation between us and one of our insurance carriers concerning these issues and insurance coverage for individual lawsuits that were not part of the class settlement has been pending in
Minnesota State Court. Recent court rulings have determined that the gender class settlement payment was appropriately covered under 
43 Table of Contents
applicable policies, and that the insurance carrier has a duty to reimburse reasonable defense costs in the gender class action and all but two of the
individual lawsuits, and to indemnify us in all but two of the individual lawsuits. This ruling is being appealed by the insurance carrier. The settlement
of the gender discrimination class claims did not include claims of putative class members who subsequently filed individual Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC charges after the denial of class status. 54 of those EEOC claimants filed
lawsuits. 52 of those suits have been settled or dismissed. The settlement amounts were not material to our financial position or results of operations. We are vigorously defending the remaining two lawsuits. We are not subject to any other pending or threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business operations, none of which
is expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. NOTE 10: ACQUISITIONS 
In August 2008, we acquired certain ongoing operations of Transera, a project forwarding company based in Calgary, Canada. The purchase price was $517 million.
Goodwill recognized in this transaction amounted to $375 million. Other intangible assets related to the acquisition amounted to $67 million which consists primarily of customer relationships, which are being amortized over six years. All goodwill
and other intangible assets related to this acquisition are tax deductible over 15 years. Our results of operations were not materially impacted by this acquisition. In July 2007, we acquired certain assets of LXSI Services, Inc. LXSI, a third party domestic air and expedited services provider based in Los Angeles, California. The purchase price was $975 million.
Goodwill recognized in this transaction amounted to $75 million. Other intangible assets related to the acquisition amounted to $16 million. All goodwill and other intangible assets related to this acquisition are tax deductible over 15 years. Our
results of operations were not materially impacted by this acquisition. In May 2006, we acquired certain assets of Payne Lynch, and Associates, Inc.
Payne Lynch, a non-asset based third party logistics company that specializes in flatbed and over dimensional freight brokerage. The purchase price was $300 million. In December 2006, we acquired certain assets of Triune Freight Private
Ltd. and Triune Logistics Private Ltd., collectively Triune, a third party logistics provider based in India. The purchase price for Triune was $40 million. Goodwill recognized in the transactions that closed in 2006 amounted to $282
million. Other intangible assets related to these transactions amounted to $23 million. The results of operations and financial condition of these
acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their acquisition dates.
