LOGILITY, INC.  NOTES TO
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS April 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002  1Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  a Business  Logility, Inc. the Company develops, markets, and supports an integrated
suite of business-to-business collaborative commerce software products. This suite of products is designed to manage the flow of information and products along the entire value chain of an enterprise, from raw materials, manufacturing, and
warehousing to final consumption. The Companys products and services are used by customers within the United States and certain international markets.  The Company is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, and is an approximately 86%-owned subsidiary of American Software, Inc. ASI. Prior to the contribution
of the following operations by ASI to the Company, the Companys operations consisted of the following: the Supply Chain Planning and WarehousePRO divisions of ASI; and Distribution Sciences Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ASI. Effective
January 23, 1997, ASI formally contributed its Supply Chain Planning division to the Company. Effective August 1, 1997, ASI contributed its WarehousePRO division to the Company. Distribution Sciences, Inc. was merged into the Company on August 5,
1997.  b Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with
Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, and SOP 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions.  License.License revenue in connection with license agreements for standard proprietary
software is recognized upon delivery of the software, providing collection is considered probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, there is evidence of an arrangement, and vendor specific objective evidence VSOE exists with respect to any
undelivered elements of the arrangement. For multiple-element arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue under the residual method as permitted by SOP 98-9, whereby 1 the total fair value of the undelivered elements, as indicated by VSOE, is
deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with SOP 97-2 and 2 the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements.  Maintenance.Revenue derived from maintenance
contracts primarily includes telephone consulting, product updates, and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the customer, as well as error reporting and correction services. Maintenance contracts are typically sold for a
separate fee with initial contractual periods ranging from one to three years with renewal for additional periods thereafter. Maintenance fees are generally billed annually in advance. Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the
maintenance agreement. In situations where all or a portion of the maintenance fee is bundled with the license fee, VSOE for maintenance is determined based on prices when sold separately.  Services.Revenue derived from services
primarily includes consulting, implementation, and training. Fees are billed under primarily time and materials arrangements and are recognized as services are performed. Reimbursements received for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in connection with consulting, implementation, and training services are classified as revenue in the statement of operations.  Indirect Channel Revenue.Revenues are recognized for sales made through indirect channels when the distributor makes the
sale to an end-user, or upon delivery to the reseller, when the license fee is fixed or determinable, the license fee is nonrefundable, and all other conditions of SOP 97-2 and SOP 98-9 are met. 
50 Table of Contents LOGILITY, INC.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued April 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002 
Deferred Revenue.Deferred revenue represents advance payments or
billings for software licenses, services, and maintenance billed in advance of the time revenue is recognized.  c Cost of Revenues  Cost of revenues for licenses includes amortization of capitalized computer software development costs, salaries and benefits, and royalties paid to
third-party software vendors. Costs for maintenance and services include the cost of personnel to conduct implementations and customer support, consulting, and other personnel-related expenses.  d Cash Equivalents  Cash equivalents of $101 million and $78 million at April 30, 2004 and
2003, respectively, consist of overnight repurchase agreements and money market deposit accounts. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  e Investments  Investments consist of commercial paper, corporate bonds, and government
securities. The Company accounts for its investments under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. In accordance with SFAS No. 115,
the Company has classified its investment portfolio as held-to-maturity, and has accounted for these investments at amortized cost. Accordingly, no adjustment for unrealized holding gains or losses has been reflected in the
Companys financial statements.  f Furniture,
Equipment, and Purchased Computer Software  Furniture and
equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of computer and communications equipment and furniture and fixtures is calculated using the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging
from three to seven years. Purchased computer software costs represent the cost of acquiring computer software. Amortization of purchased computer software costs is calculated using the straight-line method over periods of three to five years.
g Capitalized Computer Software Development Costs
The Company capitalizes certain computer software
development costs in accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. Costs incurred internally to create a computer software product or to develop an enhancement to an
existing product are charged to expense when incurred as research and development expense until technological feasibility for the respective product is established. Thereafter, all software development costs are capitalized and reported at the lower
of unamortized cost or net realizable value. Capitalization ceases when the product or enhancement is available for general release to customers. The Company makes ongoing evaluations of the recoverability of its capitalized software projects by
comparing the amount capitalized for each product to the estimated net realizable value of the product. If such evaluations indicate that the unamortized software development costs exceed the net realizable value, the Company writes off the amount
by which the unamortized software development costs exceed net realizable value. Capitalized computer software development costs are being amortized ratably based on the projected revenues associated with the related software or on a straight-line
basis over three years, whichever method results in a higher level of amortization.

Total Expenditures and Amortization.Total expenditures for capitalized
computer software development costs, total research and development expense, and total amortization of capitalized computer software development costs are as follows:  Years ended April 30 2004

Capitalized computer software development costs 18,379 15,087
Less accumulated amortization 11,973 8,140 6,406 6,947  h Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and
liability method of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under SFAS 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. The Companys results of operations are included in the consolidated Federal income tax return filed by ASI; however, the Company has provided for income taxes as if it were filing a separate income tax return.  i Use of Estimates  The preparation of the financial statements requires management of the
Company to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of capitalized computer software costs and furniture, equipment, and purchased computer software; valuation allowances for
receivables and deferred income tax assets; and obligations related to employee benefits. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  j Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The Company uses financial instruments in the normal course of its business. The carrying values of cash equivalents; trade accounts receivable and
unbilled accounts receivable; accounts payable; accrued compensation and related costs; and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities. See note 2 for disclosures regarding the
fair value of the Companys investments. 
52 Table of Contents LOGILITY, INC.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued April 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002 
k Stock Compensation Plans  The Company applies the intrinsic-value-based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations including Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation, an interpretation
of APB Opinion No. 25, to account for its fixed-plan stock options. Under this method, compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price. SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, established accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair-value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans. As allowed by SFAS No. 123, the Company has elected to
continue to apply the intrinsic-value-based method of accounting described above, and has adopted only the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the Companys stock option plans.
Following are the assumptions used in calculating the pro forma option expense amounts under SFAS No. 123 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model:  2004 2003 2002 Dividend yield
0 0 0 Expected volatility
1039 847 802 Risk-free interest rate

l Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets  The Company adopted SFAS No. 144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, on May 1, 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated
undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of by sale would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities
of a group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset 
53 Table of Contents LOGILITY, INC.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued April 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002 
and liability sections of the balance sheet. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 144, the Company accounted for long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No.
121, Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not affect the Companys financial condition or results of operations.  m Comprehensive Income  SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, establishes standards
for reporting and presentation of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of financial statements. No statements of comprehensive income have been included in the accompanying financial statements since comprehensive income and net
earnings presented in the accompanying statements of operations would be the same.  n Earnings Per Common Share  Basic earnings per common share available to common shareholders are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share available to common shareholders are based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares, such as dilutive stock options.  The numerator in calculating both basic and diluted earnings per common share for each year is the same as net earnings. The denominator is based on the
following number of common shares:  Years ended April 30 2004

being providing supply chain management software solutions to participants along the supply chain.  2Investments  Investments, which are classified as held-to-maturity, consist of the following at April 30, 2004 and 2003 in thousands:  2004 2003 Carryingvalue

Furniture, equipment and purchased software depreciation 48
Other 20 Total gross deferred income tax liabilities 2,453 2,686 Net deferred income taxes  In accordance with the
Companys Tax Sharing Agreement with ASI, the Company computes a separate, stand-alone income tax provision and settles balances due to or from ASI on this basis. All benefits derived from deferred tax assets as defined in the Tax Sharing
Agreement which include net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that arose prior to the initial public offering originally in the amount of $5,768,000, of which $1,333,000 was used in 1998 were allocated to ASI. Accordingly, the Company
will not receive any benefit from the $4,435,000 of contributed gross deferred tax assets that still remain as of April 30, 2004, but will instead record a distribution to ASI as these deferred tax assets are used. Also, the Company has generated
approximately $1,750,000 of net operating loss carryforwards tax-effected since the initial public offering which can first be used by the Company without paying a distribution to ASI. After the initial public offering, to the extent the tax
computation produces a tax benefit for the Company, ASI will be required to pay such amounts to the Company only if and when realized by ASI by a reduction in income taxes payable with respect to the current tax period. At April 30, 2004, ASI had
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $12 million which must be utilized by ASI before the Company would receive payment for any currently generated tax benefits. Such net operating losses expire in varying amounts through 2022.
5Stockholders Equity  a Stock Compensation  Prior to August 7, 1997, the Company had not issued any stock options;
however, certain employees of the Company received stock options of ASI. Effective August 7, 1997, the Company adopted the Logility, Inc. 1997 
56 Table of Contents LOGILITY, INC.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued April 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002 
Stock Plan Stock Plan. The Stock Plan provides for grants of incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options to certain key employees and directors
of the Company. The Stock Plan also allows for stock appreciation rights in lieu of or in addition to stock options. Options to purchase a maximum of 1,200,000 shares of common stock and a maximum of 300,000 units of Stock Appreciation Rights
SARs, as defined, may be granted under the Stock Plan. The options generally vest over a four-year period. The terms of the options generally are for ten years. There have been no SARs granted to date.  The Stock Plan further limits stock option grants by providing that the
number of outstanding option shares, when added to the outstanding shares held by shareholders other than American Software, may not exceed 20% of the issued and outstanding shares, if it were assumed that all of the stock options were exercised. As
of April 30, 2004, the Company could grant up to approximately 301,000 additional option shares under the limitation described above.  A summary of the status of the Companys Stock Plan as of April 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002 and changes during the years then ended is presented below:
