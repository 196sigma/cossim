STATEMENTS   
1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting
Policies Rockwell Automation, Inc. the Company or
Rockwell Automation is a leading global provider of industrial
automation power, control and information products and services.
The following is a description of the basis of presentation for
our consolidated financial statements and a description of our
significant accounting policies   
Basis of Presentation Except as indicated, amounts reflected in the
consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto relate to
our continuing operations. Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. In June 2001, we completed the spinoff of our
Rockwell Collins avionics and communications business and
certain other assets and liabilities into an independent,
separately traded, publicly held company. In September 2004, we sold our FirstPoint Contact
business. FirstPoint Contact is classified as a discontinued
operation in the consolidated financial statements for all
periods presented.   
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of the
Company include the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries
over which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions are
eliminated in consolidation.   
Use of Estimates The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States which require us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used in
accounting for, among other items, customer returns, rebates and
incentives; allowance for doubtful accounts; excess and obsolete
inventory; impairment of long-lived assets; product warranty
obligations; retirement benefits; self-insurance liabilities;
litigation, claims and contingencies, including environmental
matters; and income taxes.   
Revenue Recognition Sales are generally recorded when all of the
following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists; product
has been delivered according to contract terms and acceptance as
may be required by contract terms has occurred or services have
been rendered; pricing is fixed or determinable; and collection
is reasonably assured. We generally use contracts and customer purchase
orders to determine the existence of an arrangement. We use
shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, to
verify delivery. We assess whether the fee is fixed or
determinable based on the payment terms associated with the
transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or
adjustment. We assess collectibility based primarily on the
creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit
evaluations and analysis, as well as the customers payment
history. We record accruals for customer returns, rebates
and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based upon
historical experience. Adjustments to the accrual may be
required if actual returns, rebates and incentives differ from
historical experience or if there are changes to other
assumptions used to estimate the accrual. Rebates and incentives
are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or
customer account credits. Rebates and incentives are recognized
as cost of sales for products or services to be provided. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers
are included in sales and the related costs are included in cost
of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 35 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued   
1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting
Policies Continued   
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes time deposits
and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three
months or less.   
Receivables We record allowances for doubtful accounts based
on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as
current assessments of past due balances and economic
conditions. Receivables are stated net of allowances for
doubtful accounts of $252million at September30,
2004 and $267million at September30, 2003. In
addition, receivables are stated net of an allowance for certain
customer rebates and incentives of $78million at
September30, 2004 and $54million at
September30, 2003.   
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market using first-in, first-out FIFOor average methods.
Market is determined on the basis of estimated realizable values.   
Property Property is stated at cost. Depreciation of
property is calculated using the straight-line method over 15 to
40years for buildings and improvements and 3 to
14years for machinery and equipment. Significant renewals
and enhancements are capitalized and replaced units are written
off. Maintenance and repairs, as well as renewals of minor
amounts, are charged to expense.   
Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets generally
result from business acquisitions. We account for business
acquisitions by assigning the purchase price to tangible and
intangible assets and liabilities. Assets acquired and
liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values, and the
excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is
recorded as goodwill. Since October1, 2001 upon adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets SFAS142, goodwill and other intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives are no longer systematically
amortized but instead are reviewed for impairment annually or
more frequently if events or circumstances indicate an
impairment may be present. Any excess in carrying value over the
estimated fair value is charged to results of operations. Distributor networks, computer software products,
patents and other intangible assets with finite useful lives are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives, generally ranging from 3 to 40years.   
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate the recoverability of the recorded
amount of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may
not be fully recoverable. An impairment is assessed when the
undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset
are less than its carrying amount. If an asset is determined to
be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the
amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its
fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower
of the recorded amount or fair value less cost to sell. We
determine fair value using discounted future cash flow analysis
or other accepted valuation techniques. During 2004, we sold a facility in a
sale-leaseback transaction with a third party resulting in a
$206million pre-tax loss. The net cash proceeds from the
sale were $190million. 36 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued   
1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting
Policies Continued   
Investments Investments in affiliates over which we have the
ability to exert significant influence but we do not control,
including Rockwell Scientific Company LLC RSC, are accounted
for using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, our
proportional share of the respective affiliates earnings
or losses is included in other income expensein the
Consolidated Statement of Operations. Investments in affiliates
over which we do not have the ability to exert significant
influence are accounted for using the cost method of accounting.
These affiliated companies are not material individually or in
the aggregate to our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.   
Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative financial instruments in the
form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest
rate swap contracts to manage foreign currency and interest rate
risks. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts are used to
offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated
with intercompany transactions generally forecasted to occur
within one year cash flow hedges and changes in the fair value
of certain assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany
loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in
foreign currencies. Interest rate swap contracts are
periodically used to manage the balance of fixed and floating
rate debt. Our accounting method for derivative financial
instruments is based upon the designation of such instruments as
hedges under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. It is our policy to execute such instruments with
creditworthy banks and not to enter into derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes. All foreign currency
forward exchange contracts are denominated in currencies of
major industrial countries.   
Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating
outside of the United States with a functional currency other
than the U.S.dollar are translated into U.S.dollars
using exchange rates at the end of the respective period. Sales,
costs and expenses are translated at average exchange rates
effective during the respective period. Foreign currency
translation adjustments are included as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss. Currency transaction gains
and losses are included in the results of operations in the
period incurred.   
Research and Development Expenses Research and development RD costs are
expensed as incurred and were $1217million in 2004 1216million in 2003 and $1232million in 2002.
RD expenses are included in cost of sales in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations.   
Income Taxes We record a liability for income tax exposures
when they are probable and the amount can be reasonably
estimated. The determination of probability and the estimate of
the liability reflect the relevant tax law as applied to us
taking into account the particular country, state, or other
taxing authority.   
Earnings Per Share We present basic and diluted per share
EPSamounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net
income by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS amounts are based upon
the weighted average number of common and common equivalent
shares outstanding during the year. The difference between basic
and diluted EPS is solely attributable to stock options. We use
the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of outstanding
stock options. Stock options for which the exercise price 37 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued   
1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting
Policies Continued exceeds the average market price
out-of-the-money options over the period have an antidilutive
effect on EPS, and accordingly, are excluded from the
calculation. For the years ended September30, 2004, 2003
and 2002, options for 01million, 11million and
36million shares were excluded from the diluted EPS
calculation because they were antidilutive.   
Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Stock options
are granted at prices equal to the fair market value of our
common stock on the grant dates; therefore no compensation
expense is generally recognized in connection with stock options
granted to employees. Compensation expense resulting from grants
of restricted stock is recognized during the period in which the
service is performed. The following table illustrates the effect
on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based
method provided by SFASNo123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, had been applied for all
outstanding and unvested awards in each year in millions,

Policies Continued   
Self-Insurance Liabilities We record accruals for self-insured claims in the
period in which they are probable and reasonably estimable. Our
principal self-insurance programs include product liability and
workers compensation where we self-insure up to a
specified dollar amount. Claims exceeding this amount up to
specified limits are covered by policies purchased from
commercial insurers. We estimate the liability for the majority
of the self-insured claims with the assistance of an independent
actuarial consultant using our claims experience for the periods
being valued.   
Environmental Matters We record accruals for environmental matters in
the period in which our responsibility is probable and the cost
can be reasonably estimated. Changes to the accruals are made in
the periods in which the estimated costs of remediation change.
At environmental sites for which more than one potentially
responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for
our estimated allocable share of costs related to our
involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable
share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or
unidentified parties. At environmental sites for which we are
the only responsible party, we record a liability for the total
estimated costs of remediation. Future expenditures for
environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to
their present value. If recovery from insurers or other third
parties is determined to be probable, we record a receivable for
the estimated recovery.   
Recently Adopted Accounting
Standards In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act was signed
into law. The Act provides a federal subsidy to sponsors of
retiree healthcare benefit plans that provide a prescription
drug benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare
Part D. In May 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASBstaff issued FASB Staff Position
No.FAS106-2, Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 FSP
FAS106-2, which supercedes FASB Staff Position
No.FAS106-1, Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, and is effective
for interim or annual periods beginning after June15,
2004. We adopted FSP FAS106-2 during our fourth quarter of
2004. The impact was to decrease our other postretirement
obligations by $169million. As a result, the fiscal 2005
expense is expected to decrease by $20million.   
2.
Acquisitions of Businesses   
2003 Acquisitions In March 2003, our Control Systems segment
acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of
Weidmller Holding AGs Weidmller North
American business. In connection therewith, we entered into a
master brand label agreement, a technology/design exchange and
joint product development efforts with Weidmller. In
February 2003, our Control Systems segment acquired
substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities
of Interwave Technology, Inc., a consulting integrator focusing
on manufacturing solutions. The aggregate cash purchase price of
these businesses was $257million. Amounts recorded for
liabilities assumed were approximately $10million.   
2002 Acquisitions In September 2002, our Control Systems segment
acquired the engineering services and system integration assets
of SPEL, spol. s.r.o. In May 2002, our Control Systems segment
acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of the
controller division of Samsung Electronics Company
Limiteds Mechatronics 39 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued   
2.
Acquisitions of Businesses
Continued business. In March 2002, our Control Systems
segment acquired all of the stock of Propack Data GmbH
Propack, a provider of manufacturing information systems for
the pharmaceutical and other regulated industries. In January
2002, our Control Systems segment acquired all of the stock of
Tesch GmbH, an electronic products and safety relay
manufacturer. The aggregate cash purchase price of the
businesses we acquired in 2002, of which the majority related to
the acquisition of Propack, was $710million. Amounts
recorded for liabilities assumed were approximately
$60million. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the
businesses acquired in 2003 and 2002 have been recorded at
estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the
estimated fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible
assets was recorded as goodwill. See Note3 for goodwill
and intangible assets acquired in connection with these
acquisitions. These acquisitions were accounted for as
purchases and, accordingly, the results of operations of these
businesses have been included in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations since their respective dates of acquisition. Pro
forma financial information and allocation of the purchase price
is not presented as the combined effect of these acquisitions
was not material to our results of operations or financial
position.   
3.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets In connection with the adoption of SFAS142
in 2002, we determined that the Allen-Bradley, Reliance and
Dodge trademarks have indefinite useful lives. Accordingly, we
performed a transitional intangible asset impairment test that
resulted in an impairment charge of $561million
$352million after tax, or $019per diluted share
related to the Reliance trademark used primarily by Power
Systems. The impairment charge represents the excess of the
carrying amount of the trademark over its estimated fair value
that we determined, with the assistance of independent valuation
experts, utilizing the relief from royalty valuation method.
This method estimates the benefit to us resulting from owning
rather than licensing the trademark. Also in connection with the adoption of
SFAS142, we completed a transitional goodwill impairment
test during 2002. As a result, an impairment charge of
$726million before and after tax, or $039per
diluted share was recorded related to goodwill at a Power
Systems reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was
estimated using a combination of valuation techniques, including
the present value of expected future cash flows and historical
valuations of comparable businesses. The previous method for determining impairment
prescribed by SFASNo121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed of, utilized an undiscounted cash flow approach for
the initial impairment assessment, while SFAS142 utilizes
a fair value approach. The trademark impairment charge and the
goodwill impairment charge discussed above are the result of the
change in the accounting method for determining the impairment
of goodwill and certain intangible assets. These charges have
been recorded as the cumulative effect of accounting change in

In September 2002, we entered into an interest
rate swap contract the Swap that effectively converted our
$3500million aggregate principal amount of
615%notes, payable in 2008, to floating rate debt based
on six-month LIBOR. The floating rate was 427percent at
September30, 2004 and 352percent at
September30, 2003. The fair value of the Swap, based upon
quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities, was
$37million at September30, 2004 and
$104million at September30, 2003. As permitted by
SFASNo133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities SFAS133, as amended, we have
designated the Swap as a fair value hedge. Accordingly, the fair
value of the Swap was recorded in other assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet at September30, 2004 and 2003.
The carrying value of the underlying debt was increased to
$3537million at September30, 2004 and
$3604million at September30, 2003 in accordance
with SFAS133. At September30, 2004, we had
$6750million of unsecured committed credit facilities,
with $3375million expiring in October 2004 and
$3375million expiring in October 2005. These facilities
were available for general corporate purposes, including support
for our commercial paper borrowings. On October26, 2004,
we entered into a new five-year $6000million unsecured
revolving credit facility. It replaced both the facility
expiring on that date and the facility expiring in October 2005
which we cancelled on that date. Borrowings under our new
credit facility bear interest based on short-term money market
rates in effect during the period such borrowings are
outstanding. The terms of our credit facility contain a covenant
under which we would be in default if our debt to capital ratio
were to exceed 60percent. In addition to our
$6000million credit facility, short-term unsecured credit
facilities available to foreign subsidiaries amounted to
$1304million at September30, 2004. There were no
significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements
under any of our credit facilities. Interest payments were $409million during
2004, $547million during 2003 and $631million
during 2002. 43 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

debt approximates the carrying value due to its short-term
nature. The fair value of long-term debt was based upon quoted
market prices for the same or similar issues. The fair value of
foreign currency forward exchange contracts was based on quoted
market prices for contracts with similar maturities. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts
provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies at
specified future dates at specified exchange rates. At
September30, 2004 and 2003, we had outstanding foreign
currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of
contracts for the euro, pound sterling 44 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

InstrumentsContinued Swiss franc, Australian dollar and Canadian
dollar. The foreign currency forward exchange contracts are
recorded in other current assets in the amounts of

$47million as of September30, 2003 and other
current liabilities in the amounts of $120million as of
September30, 2004 and $466million as of
September30, 2003. We do not anticipate any material
adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
position relating to these foreign currency forward exchange
contracts. We have designated certain foreign currency forward
exchange contracts related to forecasted intercompany
transactions as cash flow hedges. The amount recognized in
earnings as a result of the ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges
was not material.

Shareowners Equity   
Common Stock At September30, 2004, the authorized stock

the holder with one Preferred Share Purchase Right Right. The
Rights will become exercisable only if a person or group,
without the approval of the board of directors, acquires, or
offers to acquire, 20% or more of the common stock, although the
board of directors is authorized to reduce the 20% threshold for
triggering the Rights to not less than 10%. Upon exercise, each
Right entitles the holder to 1/100th of a share of SeriesA
Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Company Junior
Preferred Stock at a price of $250, subject to adjustment. Upon an acquisition of the Company, each Right
other than Rights held by the acquirer will generally be
exercisable for $500 worth of either common stock of the Company
or common stock of the acquirer for $250. In certain
circumstances, each Right may be exchanged by the Company for
one share of common stock or 1/100th of a share of Junior
Preferred Stock. The Rights will expire on December6,
2006, unless earlier exchanged or redeemed at $001per

In 2003, we adjusted our accumulated currency
translation adjustments and deferred income taxes by
approximately $250million resulting from our decision to
permanently reinvest the earnings of certain foreign
subsidiaries. Unrealized losses on cash flow hedges of
$366million $221million after tax in 2004 and
$242million $150million after tax in 2003 were
reclassified into earnings and offset gains on the hedged items.
Unrealized gains of $67million $42million after
tax were reclassified into earnings in 2002 and offset losses
on the hedged items. Approximately $67million
$40million after tax of the net unrealized losses on
cash flow hedges as of September30, 2004 will be
reclassified into earnings during 2005. We expect that these
unrealized losses will be offset when the hedged items are
recognized in earnings. 11.Stock
Options Options to purchase our common stock have been
granted under various incentive plans and by board action to
directors, officers and other key employees at prices equal to
the fair market value of the stock on the dates the options were
granted. The plans provide that the option price for certain
options granted under the plans may be paid in cash, shares of
common stock or a combination thereof. Under the 2000 Long-Term Incentives Plan, we are
authorized to grant up to 240million shares of our common
stock as non-qualified options, incentive stock options, stock
appreciation rights and restricted stock. Shares available for
future grant or payment under various incentive plans were
approximately 104million at September30, 2004. None
of the employee incentive plans presently permits options to be
granted after November30, 2009. Stock options generally
expire ten years from the date they are granted and vest over
three years time-vesting options with the exception of
performance-vesting options. Performance-vesting options expire
ten years from the date they are granted and vest at the earlier
of athe date the market price of our common stock
reaches a specified level for a pre-determined period of time or

Benefits We sponsor funded and unfunded pension plans and
other postretirement benefit plans for our employees. The
pension plans cover most of our employees and provide for
monthly pension payments to eligible employees upon retirement.
Pension benefits for salaried employees generally are based on
years of credited service and average earnings. Pension benefits
for hourly employees are primarily based on specified benefit
amounts and years of service. Our policy with respect to funding
our pension obligations is to fund the minimum amount required
by applicable laws and governmental regulations. We may,
however, at our discretion, fund amounts in excess of the
minimum amount required by laws and regulations. Other
postretirement benefits are primarily in the form of retirement
medical plans and cover most of our United States employees and
provide for the payment of certain medical costs of eligible
employees and dependents upon retirement. 47 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

the decrease in the intangible 49 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

BenefitsContinued pension asset of $14million, the net
increase to shareowners equity reflected as a reduction
of accumulated other comprehensive loss was $682million. In 2004, we made voluntary contributions of
$1250million to our U.S.qualified pension plan
trust. In 2003, we made a voluntary contribution of
$500million to our U.S.qualified pension plan trust. The accumulated benefit obligation for our
pension plans is $1,7681million as of the 2004
measurement date and $1,6558million as of the 2003
measurement date. We use an actuarial measurement date of
June30 to measure our benefit obligations for pension and
other postretirement benefits.

As a result of the plan amendment adopted
effective October1, 2002, as more fully described below,
and in accordance with SFASNo106,
Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other
Than Pensions, our postretirement healthcare liabilities
were recalculated as of the date of the amendment using a
65percent discount rate, the discount rate applicable at
the date of the plan amendment. The related net periodic benefit
cost in 2003 of $291million consists of expense using a

The healthcare cost trend rate reflects the
estimated increase in gross medical claims costs as required to
be disclosed by SFASNo132, Employers
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits. As a result of the plan amendment adopted
effective October1, 2002, as more fully described below,
our effective per person retiree medical cost increase will be
zero percent beginning in 2005 for the majority of our
postretirement benefit plans. For our other plans, we are
assuming gross healthcare cost trend rate will decrease to 55%
in 2010.

Decreasing to 55% in 2010.
Effective October1, 2002, we amended our
United States postretirement healthcare benefit program in order
to mitigate the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare
services. This change will be phased in as follows: effective
January1, 2004, per an amendment to this program
implemented in 1992, we began contributing 50percent of
the amount in excess of the 2003per capita amount.
However, our calendar 2004 contribution is limited to a
75percent increase from the 2003per capita amount.
Effective January1, 2005, we will limit our future per
capita maximum contribution to our calendar 2004per capita
contribution. As a result of the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act, we have
included a reduction in our accumulated projected benefit
obligation of $169million as of September30, 2004
related to certain Other Postretirement Benefit plans. There was
no adjustment to net periodic postretirement benefit cost in
fiscal 2004. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost in fiscal
2005 is expected to decrease by $20million as a result of
the Act. In determining the expected long-term rate of
return on assets assumption, we equally consider the historical
performance and the future expected performance for returns for
each asset category, as well as the target asset allocation of
the pension portfolios. We consulted with and considered the
opinions of financial and other professionals in developing
appropriate return assumptions. This resulted in the selection
of the weighted average long-term rate of return on assets
assumption. Our weighted-average asset allocations at
September30, by asset category, are as follows

The investment objective for pension funds
related to our defined benefit plans is to meet the plans
benefit obligations, while maximizing the long-term growth of
assets without undue risk. This is accomplished by investing
plan assets within target allocation ranges and diversification
within asset categories. Target allocation ranges are guidelines
that are adjusted periodically based on ongoing monitoring by
plan fiduciaries. Investment risk is controlled by rebalancing
to target allocations on a periodic basis and ongoing monitoring
of investment manager performance relative to the investment
guidelines established for each manager. As of September30, 2004 and 2003, our
pension plans do not have investments in our common stock. In certain non-U.S.countries in which we
operate, there are no legal requirements or financial incentives
provided to companies to pre-fund pension obligations. In these
instances, benefit payments are typically paid directly from
cash as they become due, rather than through the creation of a
separate pension fund.   
Estimated Future Payments We expect to contribute approximately
$640million related to our worldwide pension plans and
$313million to our postretirement benefit plans in 2005. 51 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Rocky Flats In 2004, we recorded a benefit of

final judgment in a defense claim legal proceeding related to
our former operation of the Rocky Flats facility of the
Department of Energy. This amount is in addition to income of
$73million $44million after tax recognized in
2003 related to the Rocky Flats defense claim legal proceeding.
In March 2004, we received $151million related to this
matter. This amount is included, net of the related tax, in the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as Cash Provided by
Discontinued Operations.   
Other The net benefit of $32million before and
after tax in discontinued operations in 2002 reflects the
resolution of certain obligations related to two discontinued
businesses. Related payments of approximately $357million
were made in 2002, which have been included in Cash Used for
Discontinued Operations in the accompanying Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows.

Related Party Transactions We own 50percent of RSC. This ownership
interest is accounted for using the equity method. Our
investment in RSC of $575million at September30,

included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 53 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued

Related Party
TransactionsContinued We have an agreement with RSC pursuant to which
RSC performs research and development services for us through
2004. We were obligated to pay RSC a minimum of
$25million for such services in 2005. We incurred
$37million in 2004, $30million in 2003 and
$31million in 2002 for research and development services
performed by RSC. At September30, 2004, the amount due to
RSC for research and development services was $07million.
At September30, 2004, the amount due from RSC for cost
sharing arrangements was not significant. At September30,
2003, the amounts due to and from RSC were not significant. We share equally with Rockwell Collins, which
owns 50percent of RSC, in providing a $40million
line of credit to RSC which bears interest at the greater of our
or Rockwell Collins commercial paper borrowing rate. At
September30, 2004 and 2003, there were no outstanding
borrowings on the line of credit. During October 2004, the line
of credit was increased to $60million, with us and
Rockwell Collins still sharing equally. In addition, we and
Rockwell Collins each guarantee one-half of a lease agreement
for one of RSCs facilities. The total future minimum lease
payments under the lease are $55million. The lease
agreement has a term that ends in December 2011. We own 25percent of CoLinx, LLC CoLinx, a
company that provides logistics and e-commerce services. This
ownership interest is accounted for using the equity method. We
paid CoLinx $171million in 2004, $152million in
2003 and $151million in 2002, primarily for logistics
services. In addition, CoLinx paid us approximately
$22million in 2004, $24million in 2003 and
$27million in 2002 for the use of facilities we own and
other services. The amounts due to and from CoLinx at
September30, 2004 and 2003 were not significant.

During 2004, we recognized tax benefits of
$463million in income from continuing operations and
$184million in income from discontinued operations
related to the following items   
$345million resulting from the resolution
of certain tax matters, in part related to former businesses. A
majority of the benefits recognized related to non-U.S.tax
matters in addition to an agreement with a taxing authority
related to the treatment of an investment. Of this amount,
$115million is reflected as a reduction of the United
States income tax provision; $213million is reflected as
a reduction of the non-United States income tax provision; and
$17million is reflected as reduction of the state and
local income tax provision;
$43million related to additional state tax
benefits associated with the U.S.research and
experimentation credit refund claim in 2003 see discussion
below;and
$259million related to a refund from the
State of California for the period 1989 to 1991. Of this amount,
$75million is included as a reduction in the income tax
provision and $184million is included in Income from
Discontinued Operations.
During 2003, we recognized in earnings a tax
benefit of $694million related to a federal research and
experimentation credit refund claim Claim for the years 1997
through 2001. Of this amount, $664million is reflected as
a reduction of the United States income tax provision and
$30million is reflected as a reduction of the state and
local income tax provision. A portion of the proceeds from the
Claim were received in 2004. Upon the conclusion of the current
federal audit cycle, which is expected in 2005, the remaining
proceeds from the Claim are expected to be netted against the
liability arising from the audit. The future annual income tax
benefit related to research and experimentation expenditures is
not expected to be significant. During 2002, we resolved certain tax matters for
the period of 1995-1999. The resolution resulted in a
$482million reduction of our United States income tax
provision. 55 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

A valuation allowance of $630million was
established at September30, 2004 for certain of the above
carryforwards for which future utilization is uncertain. The
United States capital loss carryforward was increased in 2004 by
$191million as a result of the sale of our FirstPoint
Contact business. The valuation allowance was increased by a
like amount due to the uncertainty of realizing a future tax
benefit from that capital loss. In 2004, we reduced the prior years state
valuation allowance by $113million as a result of it
being more likely than not that the same amount of state
carryforward attributes will be utilized in light of our
expectation that a trend of taxable income is likely to be
sustained in subsequent years allowing for the utilization of
these state carryforwards. In addition, we reduced the prior
years valuation allowance by $23million as a result
of our ability to utilize certain non-United States
carryforwards. In 2003, we recognized a tax benefit of
$26million as a result of our ability to utilize certain
capital loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance had
been previously provided. The ability to utilize that capital
loss carryforward resulted from the sale of a majority of our
ownership interest in REJ in 2003. The effective income tax rate differed from the

Commitments and Contingent
Liabilities   
Environmental Matters Federal, state and local requirements relating to
the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal
of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the
environment have and will continue to have an effect on our
manufacturing operations. Thus far, compliance with
environmental requirements and resolution of environmental
claims has been accomplished without material effect on our
liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or
financial condition. We have been designated as a potentially
responsible party at 15 Superfund sites, excluding sites as to
which our records disclose no involvement or as to which our
potential liability has been finally determined and assumed by
third parties. We estimate the total reasonably possible costs
we could incur for the remediation of Superfund sites at
September30, 2004 to be $128million, of which
$50million has been accrued. Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings
have been asserted against us alleging violations of federal,
state and local environmental protection requirements, or
seeking remediation of alleged environmental impairments,
principally at previously owned properties. As of
September30, 2004, we have estimated the total reasonably
possible costs we could incur from these matters to be
$671million. We have recorded net environmental accruals
for these matters of $326million. In addition to the
above matters, we assumed certain other environmental
liabilities in connection with the 1995 acquisition of Reliance.
We are indemnified by ExxonMobil Corporation Exxon for
substantially all costs associated with these Reliance matters.
At September30, 2004, we have recorded a liability of
$230million and a receivable of $218million for
these Reliance matters. We estimate the total reasonably
possible costs for these matters to be $366million for
which we are substantially indemnified by Exxon. Based on our assessment, we believe that our
expenditures for environmental capital investment and
remediation necessary to comply with present regulations
governing environmental protection and other expenditures for
the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material
adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources,
competitive position or financial condition. We cannot assess
the possible effect of compliance with future requirements. 58 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Commitments and Contingent
LiabilitiesContinued   
Purchase Commitments In connection with the sale of a Power Systems
business in 2000, we entered into a supply agreement with the
buyer of the business. The agreement requires us to purchase at
least $210million per year through December31, 2005
at prices that we believe are higher than those available from
other vendors. In the event that purchases are less than
$210million in a given year, we may incur penalties which
are 25percent of the amount by which the actual purchases
were less than the contractual minimum for the period. Penalties
we paid under the terms of the supply agreement were
$13million in 2004 and $18million in 2003. The
liability recorded in connection with the supply agreement was
$13million at September30, 2004 and
$35million at September30, 2003. See Note14 for a discussion of our
commitments to related parties.   
Lease Commitments Rental expense was $852million in 2004 807million in 2003; and $822million in 2002.
Minimum future rental commitments under operating leases having

for varying periods, and certain leases include options to
purchase the leased property during or at the end of the lease
term.   
Other Matters Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have
been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the
conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product
liability, intellectual property, safety and health, employment
and contract matters. Like thousands of other companies, we have been
named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a
result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain
components of our products many years ago. We have maintained
insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense
costs, over and above self-insured retentions, for most of these
claims. The uncertainties of asbestos claim litigations and the
uncertainties related to collection of insurance coverage make
it difficult to accurately predict the ultimate resolution of
asbestos claims. Subject to these uncertainties and based on our
experience defending asbestos claims, we do not believe these
lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition. In connection with the divestiture of our former
aerospace and defense businesses the AD Business to The
Boeing Company Boeing, we agreed to indemnify Boeing for
certain matters related to operations of the AD Business
for periods prior to the divestiture. In connection with the
spinoffs of our former automotive component systems business,
semiconductor systems business and Rockwell Collins avionics and
communications business, the spun-off companies have agreed to
indemnify us for substantially all contingent 59 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Commitments and Contingent
LiabilitiesContinued liabilities related to the respective businesses,
including environmental and intellectual property matters.
Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with
certainty and some lawsuits, claims, or proceedings may be
disposed of unfavorably to us, we believe the disposition of
matters which are pending or asserted will not have a material
adverse effect on our business or financial condition. We have, from time to time, divested certain of
our businesses. In connection with such divestitures, there may
be lawsuits, claims and proceedings instituted or asserted
against us related to the period that we owned the businesses.
In addition, we have guaranteed performance and payment under
certain contracts of divested businesses, including a
$600million lease obligation of our former semiconductor
systems business, now Conexant Systems, Inc. Conexant. The
lease obligation of Conexant is secured by real property subject
to the lease and is within a range of estimated fair values of
the real property. In consideration for this guarantee, we
received $250,000per quarter from Conexant through
December31, 2003 and will receive $500,000per
quarter from Conexant through December31, 2004 unless we
are released from the guarantee prior thereto. We expect to be
released from the guarantee in 2005. In many countries we provide a limited
intellectual property indemnity as part of our terms and
conditions of sale. We also at times provide limited
intellectual property indemnities in other contracts with third
parties, such as contracts concerning: the development and
manufacture of our products; the divestiture of businesses; and
the licensing of intellectual property. Due to the number of
agreements containing such provisions, we are unable to estimate
the maximum potential future payments. However, we believe that
future payments, if any, would not be material to our business
or financial condition.

Among other considerations, we evaluate
performance and allocate resources based upon segment operating
earnings before income taxes, interest expense, costs related to
corporate offices, nonrecurring special charges, gains and
losses from the disposition of businesses, earnings and losses
from equity affiliates that are not considered part of the
operations of a particular segment and incremental acquisition
related expenses resulting from purchase accounting adjustments
such as intangible asset amortization, depreciation, inventory
and purchased research and development charges. Depending on the
product, intersegment sales are either at a market price or cost
plus a mark-up, which does not necessarily represent a market
price. The accounting policies used in preparing the segment
information are consistent with those described in Note 1. 61 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

64 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of Rockwell Automation, Inc. Milwaukee, Wisconsin We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet of Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company as of September30, 2004 and 2003, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, shareowners
equity, cash flows, and comprehensive income for each of the
three years in the period ended September30, 2004. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the Index at a 2. These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company at September30, 2004 and
2003, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended September30,
2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion,
such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth therein. As described in Note3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, on October1, 2001, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Standards No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin November15, 2004 65

Item 5.
Controls and Procedures. We carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of our management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness, as of September30, 2004, of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule13a-15. Based upon
that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
are effective as of the end of the year ended September30,
2004 to timely alert them to material information relating to
the Company including its consolidated subsidiaries required
to be included in our Exchange Act filings. In fiscal 2003, as a complement to our existing
overall program of internal control, we initiated a company-wide
review of our internal control over financial reporting as part
of the process of preparing for compliance with Section404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As a result of the review, we
made numerous improvements to the design and effectiveness of
our internal controls through the year ended September30,
2004, especially our internal controls related to our
information technology systems. Some of these changes could be
deemed to have materially improved our internal control over
financial reporting. We anticipate that improvements will
continue to be made. PARTIII
