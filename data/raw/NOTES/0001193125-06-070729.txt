NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1.
BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY Retractable Technologies,
Inc. the Company was incorporated in Texas on May9, 1994, to design, develop, manufacture and market safety syringes and other safety medical products for the healthcare profession. The Company began to develop its manufacturing
operations in 1995. The Companys manufacturing and administrative facilities are located in Little Elm, Texas. The Companys primary products are the VanishPoint syringe in the 1cc, 3cc, 5cc and 10cc sizes and blood collection tube holders. The Company includes the 1cc syringe in
an allergy tray. The Company has conducted preliminary clinical evaluations and worked with national distributors to encourage healthcare facilities to transition from the use of standard syringes to the VanishPoint syringe.  2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Cash and cash
equivalents For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include unrestricted cash and investments with original
maturities of three months or less. Accounts receivable The Company records trade receivables when revenue is recognized. No product has been consigned to customers. The Companys allowance for doubtful
accounts is primarily determined by review of specific trade receivables. Those accounts that are doubtful of collection are included in the allowance. An additional allowance has been established based on a percentage of receivables outstanding.
These provisions are reviewed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Trade receivables are charged off when there is certainty as to their being uncollectible. Trade receivables are considered delinquent when payment has
not been made within contract terms. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined using a standard cost method, which approximates average cost. A reserve is established for any excess or obsolete inventories.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Cost includes major expenditures for improvements and replacements which extend useful lives or increase
capacity and interest cost associated with significant capital additions. For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, the Company capitalized interest of approximately $105,000; $53,000; and $27,000, respectively. Gains or losses
from property disposals are included in income. 
F-9 Table of Contents
Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the following useful
lives:  Production equipment
3 to 13 years Office furniture and equipment
3 to 10 years Buildings
39 years Building improvements
15 years Automobiles
7 years Long-lived assets The Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets using an assessment of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to such assets.
In the event that assets are found to be carried at amounts which are in excess of estimated gross future cash flows, the assets will be adjusted for impairment to a level commensurate with a discounted cash flow analysis of the underlying assets.
Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current years presentation. Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost and consist primarily of patents, a license agreement granting exclusive rights to use patented
technology, and trademarks which are amortized using the straight-line method over 17 years. Financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments is determined by reference to various market data and other valuation techniques as appropriate. The Company
believes that the fair value of financial instruments approximates their recorded values. Concentrations of credit risk 
The Companys financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
Cash balances, some of which exceed the federally insured limits, are maintained in financial institutions; however, management believes the institutions are of high credit quality. The majority of accounts receivable are due from companies which
are well-established entities. As a consequence, management considers any exposure from concentrations of credit risks to be limited. The Company had a high concentration of sales with two significant customers. For the year ended December31,
2005, the aforementioned customers accounted for $8,422,754, or 348%, of net sales, and their aggregated accounts receivable balance at December31, 2005, was $365,888. Revenue recognition Revenue is
recognized for sales to distributors when title and risk of ownership passes to the distributor, generally upon shipment. Revenue is recorded on the basis of sales price to distributors, less contractual pricing allowances. Contractual pricing
allowances consist of irebates granted to distributors who provide tracking reports which show, among other things, the facility that purchased the products, and iia provision for estimated contractual pricing allowances for products
that the Company has not received tracking reports. Rebates are recorded when issued and are applied against the customers receivable balance. The provision for contractual pricing allowances is reviewed at the end of each quarter and adjusted
for changes in levels of products for which there is no tracking report. Additionally, if it becomes clear that tracking reports will not be provided by individual distributors, the provision is further adjusted. The estimated contractual allowance
is netted against individual distributors accounts receivable balances for financial reporting purposes. The resulting net balance is reflected in accounts receivable or accounts payable, as appropriate. The terms and conditions of contractual
pricing allowances are governed by contracts between the Company and its 
F-10 Table of Contents
distributors. Revenue for shipments directly to end-users is recognized when title and risk of ownership
passes from the Company. Any product shipped or distributed for evaluation purposes is expensed. Marketing fees The Company paid Abbott Laboratories, Inc. Abbott marketing fees for services they provided. The contracted services were to include
participation in promotional activities, development of educational and promotional materials, representation at trade shows, clinical demonstrations, inservicing and training, and tracking reports detailing the placement of the Companys
products to end-users. Marketing fees were accrued at the time of the sale of product to Abbott. These fees were paid after Abbott provided the Company a tracking report of product sales to end-users. These costs were included in sales and marketing
expense in the Statements of Operations. No marketing fees have been accrued since October15, 2003, the date the National Marketing and Distribution Agreement with Abbott was terminated. Litigation Proceeds Proceeds from
litigation settlements in the Companys federal antitrust lawsuit, Retractable Technologies, Inc. v. Becton Dickinson Co., et al. were recognized when realizable. Generally, realization was not reasonably assured and expected until
proceeds were collected. Such amounts were net of attorneys fees, court costs, legal expenses, and amounts payable under the Covenant Not to Sue. Liability for attorneys fees was not incurred until proceeds are collected. Reimbursed Discounts The Company
receives reimbursed discounts from one of the settlement agreements reached in its federal antitrust lawsuit, Retractable Technologies, Inc. v. Becton Dickinson Co. et al. Payments under the discount reimbursement program are recognized
upon invoicing of amounts due under the agreement provided collection is reasonably assured. Such amounts are presented in the Statements of Operations as a separate component of revenues. Income taxes The Company provides
for deferred income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109. SFAS 109 requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting
for income taxes based on the tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, based on enacted rates expected to be in effect when such basis differences reverse in future periods. Deferred tax
assets are periodically reviewed for realizability. The company has sufficient taxable income from prior carryback years to realize all of its current deductible temporary differences that are reasonably expected to reverse in the upcoming year. The
Company has established a valuation allowance for the remaining net asset as future taxable income cannot be reasonably assured at this time. Earnings per share The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No128, Earnings Per
Share, which establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings for the period adjusted for any cumulative dividends for the period by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Companys potentially dilutive Common Stock equivalents, consist of options, convertible debt and convertible Preferred Stock and are dilutive or antidilutive in different periods as
shown in the schedule below:  Years Ended December31 2005 2004 2003 Net Income loss 1,238,323 54,691,395 7,448,497 Preferred Stock dividend requirements 1,502,887 1,993,516 2,560,723 Earnings loss available to common shareholders 2,741,210 52,697,879 4,887,774 Effect of dilutive securities Preferred Stock dividend requirements 1,993,516 Convertible debt interest and loan fees 351,860 454,379 Earnings loss available to common shareholders after assumed conversions 2,741,210 54,339,535 4,433,395 Average common shares outstanding 23,332,277 22,600,166 21,001,004 Dilutive stock equivalents from stock options 269,016 292,528 Shares issuable upon conversion of Preferred Stock 2,572,116 Shares issuable upon conversion of convertible debt 685,855 750,000 Average common and common equivalent shares outstanding assuming dilution 23,332,277 26,127,153 22,043,532 Basic earnings loss per share 012 233 023 Diluted earnings loss per share 012 208 020 
F-11 Table of Contents
Research and development costs Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Stock-based compensation The Company has three stock-based director, officer and employee
compensation plans which are described more fully in Note 11. Prior to 2002, the Company accounted for those plans under the recognition and measurement provisions intrinsic value method of APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees, and related Interpretations. Effective January1, 2002, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, prospectively to all director, officer and
employee awards granted, modified, or settled after December31, 2001. Awards under the Companys plans vest over periods up to three years. Therefore, the cost related to stock-based compensation included in the determination of net
income for 2003 is less than what would have been recognized if the fair value method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of SFAS No123. SFAS No123 indicates that the fair value method is the preferable
method of accounting. The following table indicates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the fair value method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period.

Generally, the approach in SFAS No123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS No123. SFAS No123R must be adopted by the Company by the first quarter of 2006. Currently, the Company uses the Black-Scholes model to
estimate the value of stock options granted to employees and is evaluating option valuation models, including the Black-Scholes model, to determine which model the Company will utilize upon adoption of SFAS No123R. The Company plans to
adopt SFAS No123R using the modified-prospective method. Management does not anticipate that adoption of SFAS No123R will have a material impact on the Companys stock-based compensation expense. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to
clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material spoilage, should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. In addition, this Statement requires the allocation of fixed production
overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in SFAS No151 are effective for inventory costs incurred during the Companys fiscal year beginning January1, 2006.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No151 on its financial statements. In September 2005, the Emerging Issues Task
Force EITF ratified EITF Issue No05-7, Accounting for Modifications to Conversion Options Embedded in Debt Instruments and Related Issues. This consensus concludes that an entity should include, upon the modification of a
convertible debt instrument, the change in fair value of the related embedded conversion option in the analysis to determine whether a debt instrument has been extinguished. The consensus should be applied to future modifications of debt instruments
beginning in the interim reporting period beginning January1, 2006. The application of this consensus is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. EITF Issue No05-8, Income Tax Consequences of Issuing Convertible Debt with a Beneficial Conversion Feature was ratified in September 2005.
This consensus concludes that the issuance of convertible debt with a beneficial conversion feature results in a temporary basis difference for purposes of applying SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The consensus should be
applied to financial statements beginning in the interim reporting period beginning January1, 2006. The application of this consensus is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or
financial position.  3.
