Item 8
hereof, for financial information about the Company foreign and domestic
operations and export sales required by this Item.
The
Company uses a process of integrated lead qualification and sales demonstration.
Once a customer opportunity is identified, the Company employs a team-based
sales approach involving inside and outside sales personnel who are supported by
application engineers. The Company employs a variety of marketing techniques to
promote brand awareness and customer identification. 6 Research
and Development
The
Company believes that its future success depends on its ability to maintain
technological leadership, which will require ongoing enhancements of its
products and the development of new applications and products that provide 3-D
measurement solutions. Accordingly, the Company intends to continue to make
substantial investments in the development of new technologies, the
commercialization of new products that build on the Company existing
technological base, and the enhancement and development of additional
applications for its products.
The
Company research and development efforts are directed primarily at enhancing
the functional adaptability of its current products and developing new and
innovative products that respond to specific requirements of the emerging market
for 3-D measurement systems. The Company research and development efforts have
been devoted primarily to mechanical hardware, electronics and software. The
Company engineering development efforts will continue to focus on enhancing
our existing products and developing new products for the CAM2
market.
At
December31, 2004, the Company employed 43scientists
and technicians in its research and development efforts. Research and
development expenses were approximately $54 million in 2004 as compared to $45
million in 2003 and $40 million in 2002. We believe that the continual
development or acquisition of innovative new products is critical to our future
success. The field of CAM2 and more broadly, 3-D measurement, continues to
expand and new technologies and applications will be essential to competing in
this market.
Research
and development activities, especially with respect to new products and
technologies, are subject to significant risks, and there can be no assurance
that any of the Company research and development activities will be completed
successfully or on schedule, or, if so completed, will be commercially
accepted.
Intellectual
Property
The
Company holds or has pending 74 patents in the United States and related patents
worldwide. The Company also has 10 registered trademarks in the United States
and worldwide, 1 foreign registered trademark, 4 trademark applications pending
in the United States and 5 foreign trademark applications pending. 
The
Company relies on a combination of contractual provisions and trade secret laws
to protect its proprietary information. There can be no assurance that the steps
taken by the Company to protect its trade secrets and proprietary information
will be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of its proprietary information or
preclude third-party development of similar intellectual property.
Despite
the Company efforts to protect its proprietary rights, unauthorized parties
may attempt to copy aspects of the Company products or to obtain and use
information that the Company regards as proprietary. The Company intends to
vigorously defend its proprietary rights against infringement by third parties.
However, policing unauthorized use of the Company products is difficult,
particularly overseas, and the Company is unable to determine the extent to
which piracy of its software products exists. In addition, the laws of some
foreign countries do not protect the Company proprietary rights to the same
extent as the laws of the United States.
The
Company does not believe that any of its products infringe on the proprietary
rights of third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that third parties
will not claim infringement by the Company with respect to current or future
products. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming,
result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or require the
Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing
agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to the Company
or at all, which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company
business, operating results and financial condition. 7 Manufacturing
and Assembly
The
Company manufactures its products at its headquarters in Lake Mary, Florida, and
at its plants in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania and Schaffhausen, Switzerland.
Manufacturing consists primarily of assembling finished products with components
and subassemblies, purchased from suppliers, into finished products. The primary
components, which include machined parts and electronic circuit boards, are
produced by subcontractors according to the Companys specifications. All
products are assembled, calibrated and tested for accuracy and functionality
before shipment. In limited circumstances, the Company performs in-house circuit
board assembly and part machining. 
The
Company manufacturing, engineering, and design headquarters have been
registered to the ISO-9001 standard since July 1998. Semi-annual surveillance
audits have documented continuous improvement to this multinational standard.
The Company continues to examine its scope of registration as the business
evolves and has chosen English as the standard business language for its
operations. This decision is expected to significantly influence the Companys
operations and documentation globally. This has been done in concert with the
ISO Standard Registrar, and is expected to increase customer confidence in the
Companys products and services worldwide.
The
Company takes a global approach to ISO registration, seeking to have all
locations registered with identical scope of accreditation and capabilities for
the products generated and serviced. In 2004 FARO took this to the highest level
possible. All manufacturing sites are now jointly registered to ISO-9001:2000.
In addition, all service sites United States, Germany, Japan, China, Brazil
have been jointly accredited toISO-17025
for Calibration and Certification Laboratories by the Laboratory Accreditation
Bureau.
Competition
Our
portable measurement systems compete in the broad market for measurement devices
for manufacturing and industrial applications which, in addition to portable
articulated arms and laser tracker products, consist of fixed-base CMMs, check
fixtures, and handheld measurement tools. The broad market for measurement
devices is highly competitive. In the Faro Gage product line, manufacturers of
handheld measurement tools and fixed-base CMMs include a significant number of
well-established companies that are substantially larger and possess
substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we
possess. In the Faro Arm and Faro Scan Arm product lines, we compete with
Hexagon Metrology, a division of Hexagon. Hexagonis significantly larger
than us. In the Faro Laser Tracker product line, we compete primarily with Leica
Geosystems,a division of Leica.Leica is significantly larger than
us. We will be required to make continued investments in technology and product
development to maintain our technological advantage over our competition. We
cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make additional
investments in technology and product development or that our product
development efforts will allow us to successfully compete as the industry
evolves.
As the
market for laser trackers and our portable coordinate measurement machines
expands, additional competition may emerge and the Companys existing and future
competitors may commit more resources to the markets in which the Company
participates.
The
worldwide trend toward CAD-based factory floor metrology has resulted in the
introduction of CAD-based inspection software and statistical process control
for conventional CMMs by most of the large CMM manufacturers. Certain CMM
manufacturers are miniaturizing, and in some cases increasing the mobility of,
their conventional CMMs. Nonetheless, these CMMs still have small measurement
volumes, lack the adaptability typical of portable, articulated arm measurement
devices, and lose accuracy outside the controlled environment of the metrology
lab. 8 Backlog
At
December31, 2004,the
Company had orders representing approximately$51
millionin
product sales outstanding. The majority of these specific orders were shipped by
March 7, 2005, and, as of March 7, 2005, the Company had orders representing
approximately $69 millionin
product sales outstanding. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had orders
representing approximately $75 million and $88 million in product sales
outstanding, respectively.
The
Companys decreased backlog is the
result of increased production of its laser tracker and articulated arm product
lines in 2004
to meet customer demand. The Company believes that substantially all of the
outstanding sales orders as of March 7, 2005 will be shipped during 2005. Employees At
December31, 2004, the Company had 453 full-time employees, consisting of
167 sales and marketing professionals, 95 production staff, 43 research and
development staff, 66 administrative staff, and 82 customer service/application
engineering specialists. The Company is not a party to any collective bargaining
agreements. The Company believes its employee relations are good. Management
believes that its future growth and success will depend in part on its ability
to retain and continue to attract highly skilled personnel. The Company
anticipates that it will be able to obtain the additional personnel required to
satisfy its staffing requirements over the foreseeable future.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.
The
following information should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated
Financial Statements of the Company, including the notes thereto, included
elsewhere in this document.
Overview
We
design, develop, market and support portable, software-driven, 3-D measurement
systems that are used in a broad range of manufacturing and industrial
applications. Our principal products are the Faro Arm and Faro Gage articulated
arm measuring devices, the Faro Laser Tracker, a laser-based measuring device,
and their companion CAM2 software, which provide for CAD-based inspection and
factory-level statistical process control. In the first half of 2004, we
introduced a new non-contact laser probe option for the Faro Arm. When sold
together, this combination of the Faro Arm and its laser probe option is called
the Faro Scan Arm. Together, all of these products integrate the measurement and
quality inspection function with CAD software to improve productivity, enhance
product quality and decrease rework and scrap in the manufacturing process. Our
products bring precision measurement, quality inspection and specification
conformance capabilities, integrated with leading CAD software, to the factory
floor. We are a pioneer in the development and marketing of 3-D measurement
technology in manufacturing and industrial applications and currently hold 39
patents. Our products have been purchased by more than 3,800 customers
worldwide, ranging from small machine shops to such large manufacturing and
industrial companies as Audi, Bell Helicopter, Boeing, British Aerospace,
Caterpillar, Daimler Chrysler, General Electric, General Motors, Honda, Johnson
Controls, Komatsu Dresser, Lockheed Martin, Siemens and Volkswagen among many
others. 13 We
continue to pursue international markets. We established sales offices in France
and Germany in 1996, Great Britain in 1997, Japan and Spain in 2000, Italy in
2001, and China in 2003. We opened sales offices in South Korea and India in the
fourth quarter of 2004. In 2003 we began to manage and report our global sales
in three regions: the Americas, Europe/Africa and Asia/Pacific. In 2004 430% of
our sales were in the Americas compared to 527% in 2003, 444% were in the
Europe/Africa region compared to 386% in 2003 and 126% were in the
Asia/Pacific region, compared to 87% in 2003 see also Note 20 Geographic Data
to the financial statements below. Although we expect variations in the
percentage of our sales in the Asia/Pacific region from quarter to quarter going
forward, we generally expect higher percentage sales growth in the Asia/Pacific
region than the other regions in 2005 and 2006 as a result of our new sales
offices in China, India and South Korea, and the addition of sales personnel and
the opening of a service center in our Japan office. We also expect to open an
Asia/Pacific regional headquarters in Singapore in 2005.
We derive
revenues primarily from the sale of our Faro Arm, Faro Scan Arm, Faro Gage and
Faro Laser Tracker 3-D measurement equipment, and its related multi-faceted CAM2
software. Revenue related to these products is recognized upon shipment. In
addition, we sell one and three-year extended warranties and training and
technology consulting services relating to our products. We recognize the
revenue from extended warranties proportionately, in the same manner as costs
are incurred for such revenues. We also receive royalties from licensing
agreements for our historical medical technology and generally recognize the
revenue from these royalties as licensees use the technology. Royalties from
licensing agreements were $817,000, $601,000 and $990,000 in 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.
In 2003,
we began to manufacture our Faro Arm products in Switzerland for customer orders
from the Europe/Africa and Asia/Pacific regions. We began to manufacture our
Faro Gage product, and parts of our Faro Laser Tracker product in our Swiss
plant in the third quarter of 2004. We expect to begin complete production of
the Faro Laser Tracker product in our Swiss plant in 2005. The production of
these products for customer orders from the Americas will be done in our
manufacturing facilities located in Florida and Pennsylvania. We expect all our
existing plants to have the production capacity necessary to support our growth,
at least through 2006. 
Cost of
sales consists primarily of material, production overhead and labor. Since our
IPO in 1997, annual gross margin has been in the range of 54%-64% of sales. We
have established a goal of maintaining target full year ranges in 2005 for gross
margin between 59% and 62% and operating margin between 145% and 185%. Gross
margin for fiscal 2004 was within that range at 618%, although gross margin for
the fourth quarter of 2004 was below that range at 580% partly as a result of a
higher proportion of sales coming from demonstration equipment which carry lower
margins. 
Selling
expenses as a percentage of sales grew slightly in 2004 to 267% compared to
256% in 2003. The higher percentage in 2004 was due to the addition of new
sales personnel in the Asia/Pacific region resulting in higher costs while the
additional sales people become fully trained and productive. We have established
a goal of maintaining selling expenses as a percentage of sales at
25%.
General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries for administrative
personnel, rent, utilities and professional and legal expenses. General and
administrative expenses were higher in the second half of 2004 due in part to an
increase in professional and legal expenses of approximately $670,000 directly
related to our compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley section 404 regarding internal
controls and procedures. We expect this amount to be approximately $500,000 in
2005. Notwithstanding the expected higher ongoing costs of compliance with new
laws and regulations governing public companies in the United States, we expect
general and administrative expenses to gradually drop to approximately 10% of
sales as higher sales should not require a proportionate increase in these
expenses. Research and development expenses represent salaries, equipment and
third-party services. We have a commitment to support ongoing research and
development and intend to continue to fund these efforts at the level of 5-7% of
sales going forward. 14 We expect
to incur expenses of approximately $2 million in 2005 as calculated under the
Black-Scholes method of FAS 123, related to our expected adoption of FAS 123R
for the expensing of stock options. We are investigating other valuation methods
for these expenses prior to our adoption of FAS 123R. These expenses will be
apportioned according to the employees who have received stock options into cost
of sales, selling, general and administrative or research and development
costs.
In 2003
and 2004 we have been able to use previously reserved net operating loss
carry-forwards, which have reduced our effective tax rate to 123% in 2003 and
23% in 2004. We have also received a favorable permanent income tax rate
commitment from the Swiss government as an incentive to establish a
manufacturing plant in Switzerland. We are not providing deferred tax assets on
temporary differences scheduled to reverse after the commitment period because
all of its earnings are included in the current tax provision. By the second
quarter of 2005 we expect that approximately 60% of our total shipments will
come from the Swiss plant. These shipments will be to Europe/Africa and the
Asia/Pacific regions.As a
result we expect the blended consolidated tax rate to be 20% for 2005, and
this could fluctuate depending upon, among other things, our ability to use more
previously reserved net operating loss carry-forwards and the amount of our
sales in Europe and shipments from our Swiss plant. See Critical Accounting
Policies - Income Taxes below.
Accounting
for wholly owned foreign subsidiaries is maintained in the currency of the
respective foreign jurisdiction and, therefore, fluctuations in exchange rates
may have an impact on inter-company accounts reflected in our consolidated
financial statements. We are aware of the availability of off-balance sheet
financial instruments to hedge exposure to foreign currency exchange rates,
including cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and foreign currency options
see Foreign Exchange Exposure below. However, we do not regularly use such
instruments, and none were utilized in 2004 or 2003.
We have
had ten consecutive profitable quarters through December 31, 2004. This followed
a period of losses in 2001 and the first half of 2002, which resulted from an
economic slowdown in manufacturing in 2001, and expenses arising from the
acquisition in January 2002 of SpatialMetriX Corporation SMX. Our sales growth
and return to profitability since then was a result of a number of factors
including the acquisition of SMX, which manufactured the predecessor to the Faro
Laser Tracker, the introduction in October 2002 of the latest generation of our
traditional Faro Arm product, the introduction of the Faro Gage in September
2003, the introduction of our Faro Scan Arm product in 2004, and an increase in
the number of sales people worldwide. Our worldwide sales and marketing
headcount in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was 167, 120, and 106,
respectively.
In the
third quarter of 2003 the Company recorded approximately $11 million in other
income as a result of receiving approximately 100,000 shares of Company stock
related to a positive arbitration settlement between the Company and the former
SMX shareholders. 
On
November 12, 2003, we sold 1,158,000 shares of common stock to certain
institutional investors in a private placement. The shares were sold for $2150
per share, resulting in total proceeds before placement agent fees and other
offering expenses of $249 million. This transaction significantly increased our
cash available for a variety of potential uses including working capital,
acquisitions, capital expenditures and our ongoing international expansion. See
also Liquidity and Capital Resources. 15 Results

2004
Compared to 2003 
Sales.
Sales increased $252 million or 351% from $718 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003 to $970 million for year ended December 31, 2004.
This increase resulted from higher unit sales of the Faro Arm, Faro Laser
Tracker and Faro Gage products, and an overall increase in headcount in sales
and marketing of 47, or 392% from 120 in 2003 to 167 in 2004.Geographically,
sales increased $38 million or 100% in the Americas, $154 million or 556% in
Europe/Africa, and $60 million or 968% in the Asia/Pacific region. Our sales
growth is driven to a large extent by the growth in the number of sales people
we have. We expect that new sales people will have a learning curve of 3-6
months before they are fully functional. In 2004 our sales and marketing
headcount increased 23% from 44 to 54 in the Americas, 13% from 67 to 76 in
Europe /Africa, and 311% from 9 to 37 in the Asia/Pacific region. 
Gross
profit.
Gross profit increased $177 million or 418% from $423 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003 to $600 million for the year ended December
31, 2004. Gross margin increased from 589% for the year ended December 31, 2003
to 618% for the year ended December 31, 2004 due to reduced price discounts,
reduced service costs as a percentage of sales from 90% in 2003 to 85% in
2004, as a result of improvements in product quality and efficiencies in
production. 16 Selling
expenses.
Selling expenses increased by $76 million or 415%, from $183
million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $259 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004. This increase was a result of higher commissions of $30
million, higher salaries and bonuses of $25 million, higher product
demonstration costs of $12 million and higher marketing costs of $09 million.
As a percentage of sales, selling expenses increased to 267% of sales in 2004
from 256% in 2003. 
General
and administrative expenses.
General and administrative expenses increased by $19 million or
194% from $98 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $117 million
for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase was due to higher salaries
and bonuses of $14 million, higher professional and legal fees of $787,000 and
higher facilities and rent of $349,000, partially offset by reduced stock option
expense of $441,000. General and administrative expenses as percentage of sales
fell to 121% of sales in 2004 from 137% of sales in 2003. In filings prior to
Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2004 we represented the cost of employee
stock options as a separate line item in our consolidated statements of
operations. In accordance with SEC Regulation S-X we have eliminated the
separate line item for all periods presented, and have included the cost of
employee stock options in the appropriate expense category, according to each
employees function. Virtually all of the employees who had stock options that
gave rise to an expense were in administration. As a result, the $98 million in
general and administration expenses for 2003 reported above is higher than the
$91 million previously reported in our Form 10-K for 2003 by $07 million in
employee stock option expense in 2003.
Depreciation
and amortization expenses.
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $220,000 or
105% from $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $23 million in
2004, due to an
increase in depreciation of new equipment and capital leases. 
Research
and development expenses.
Research and development expenses increased by $910,000 or 202%
from $45 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $54 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004. This was due to an increase in salaries and
bonuses of $660,000 and an increase in external services and other project
expenses of $250,000. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales
were 56% in 2004 compared to 63% in 2003.
Interest
income / expense.
Interest income increased by $274,000 or 334% from $82,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2003 to $356,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004
primarily from an increase in investments in 2004 related to the proceeds from
the Companys sale of stock in November 2003 see also Overview above
and Liquidity
and Capital Resources below.
Interest expense decreased by $34,000 from $46,000 for the year ended December
31, 2003 to $12,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004 See Liquidity
and Capital Resources below. Other
income, net.
Other
income, net decreased by $16 million from $20 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003 to $04 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This
decrease was primarily due to a settlement of litigation with the former
shareholders of SMX for $11 million in 2003 see also Note 2 - Acquisition and
a reduction in foreign exchange gains of $153,000 in 2004.
Income
tax expense. 
Income tax expense decreased $08 million from $12 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003 to $358,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
effective tax rate in 2004 was 23% of income before income tax compared to
123% in 2003. The primary reason for the lower than expected tax rate was the
tax benefit attributable to a reduction in the valuation allowance of
approximately $32 million. Of that reduction, $15 million relates to usage of
net operating losses in foreign jurisdictions and $17 million of the
reduction in the valuation allowance relates to the partial release of the
valuation allowance taken in the fourth quarter on foreign deferred tax assets
which the Company now believes are more likely than not to be realized. The
Company determined that the amount of deferred tax assets relating to the net
operating loss carryforwards of foreign subsidiaries was understated by
approximately $37 million at December 31, 2003. As these net operating loss
carryforwards were fully reserved at December 31, 2003 by a valuation allowance,
there is no income statement or balance sheet impact to be recognized for 2003.
The Company has $50 million in net deferred tax assets remaining, which will
more likely than not be realized in 2005 and thereafter if the Company remains
consistently profitable See also Note 14-Income Taxes. Separate from income
tax expenses, the Company recorded an addition to shareholders equity of $24
million for the income tax benefit received from the exercise of unqualified
stock options by employees. 17 Net
income loss. Net
income increased $66 million or 795% from $83 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003 to $149 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as a
result of the factors described above.
2003
Compared to 2002 
Sales.Sales
increased $256 million or 554% from $462 million for the year ended December
31, 2002 to $718 million for year ended December 31, 2003. The increase
resulted from higher unit sales of the Faro Arm and Laser Tracker products, an
increase in headcount in sales and marketing from 106 in 2002 to 120 in 2003 and
from a 15% average price increase on existing products on January 1,
2003.Geographically,
sales increased $154 million or 685% in the Americas, $92 million or 498% in
Europe/Africa and $09 million or 178% in the Asia/Pacific region.
Gross
profit.Gross
profit increased by $171 million or 681% from $251 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002 to $422 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Gross
margin percentage increased from 544% for the year ended December 31, 2002 to
589% for the year ended December 31, 2003 due to higher selling prices and
efficiencies in the Faro Laser Tracker manufacturing plant output.
Selling
expenses.Selling
expenses increased by $44 million or 317% from $139 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002 to $183 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
This increase was a result of increased sales head count and higher commissions
due to higher sales. As a percentage of sales, selling expenses dropped to 256%
of sales in 2003 from 300% in 2002.
General
and administrative expenses.General
and administrative expenses increased by $19 million or 241% from $79 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $98 million for the year ended December
31, 2003. The increase was primarily due to the increase in professional and
legal fees, stock option expense, service charges and network costs. General and
administrative expenses as a percentage of sales fell to 137% of the sales in
2003 from 170% of the sales in 2002.
Depreciation
and amortization expenses.Depreciation
and amortization expenses decreased by $149,000 or 65% from $23 million for
the year ended December 31, 2002 to $21 million in 2003 due to a
reduction in amortization of existing product technology of $374,000, offset by
an increase of $225,000 in depreciation of new equipment.
Research
and development expenses.Research
and development expenses increased by $497,000 or 124% from $40 million for
the year ended December 31, 2002 to $45 million for the year ended December 31,
2003 due primarily to the increased subcontractor costs and
materials. The
Company has a commitment to spend at least 5% of sales on research and
development.
Interest
income / expense.Interest
income decreased by $479,000 or 854% from $561,000 for the year ended December
31, 2002 to $82,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily from lower
average investments and lower interest rates in 2003. Interest expense increased
by $18,000 from $28,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $46,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2003 due to increased use of a credit line See
Liquidity
and Capital Resources below. 18 Other
income.
Other
income, net increased by $14 million from $601,000 for the year ended December
31, 2002 to $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 due primarily to
the settlement of litigation with the former shareholders of SMX for $11
million. See also Note 2-Acquisition.
Income
tax expense.
Income tax expense increased by $947,000 from $211,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2002 to $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The
effective tax rate in 2003 was 123% of income before income tax. The primary
reason for the relatively low tax rate was a reduction in the valuation
allowance of approximately $40 million. Of that reduction, $28 million relates
to usage of net operating losses in foreign jurisdictions and $12 million of
the reduction in valuation allowance relates to domestic assets for which the
Company now believes are more likely than not to be realized. The Company has
$17 million in deferred tax assets remaining, which may be recognized in 2004
if the Company remains consistently profitable. See also Note 14-Income Taxes.
Separate from income tax expenses, the Company recorded an addition to
shareholders equity of $14 million for the income tax benefit received from
the exercise of unqualified stock options by employees.
Net
income loss. The
results from operations increased by $103 million from a loss of $20 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $83 million for the year ended December
31, 2003 as a result of the factors described above.
Liquidity
and Capital Resources Since
1997, the Company had financed its operations primarily from cash provided by
operating activities and from the proceeds of its 1997 initial public offering
of common stock approximately $317 million. On November 12, 2003 the Company
along with the Company two co-founders completed a $415 million private
placement of its common stock with various institutional investors. Under the
terms of the agreement, the Company agreed to sell 1,158,000 shares, or
approximately 8% of total shares outstanding, and the two co-founders of the
Company, Simon Raab and Gregory Fraser, agreed to sell 772,000 shares, or
approximately 20% of their holdings, in the aggregate. The shares were sold for
$2150 per share, resulting in total proceeds before placement agent fees and
other offering expenses of $249 million and $166 million to the Company and
the co-founders, respectively.
On
September 17, 2003, the Company entered into a loan agreement with SunTrust Bank
for a line of credit of $5 million. This agreement was renewed and is due to
mature on August 31, 2005. The facility bears an interest rate at LIBOR plus
175%. The Company has not drawn on this line of credit. 
On
January 10, 2005, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 with
the Securities and Exchange Commission allowing it to raise proceeds of up to
$125 million. The proceeds from any offerings with respect to this registration
statement, if any, would be used for either repayment or refinancing of debt,
acquisition of additional businesses or technologies or for working capital and
general corporate purposes.
For the
year ended December 31, 2004, net cash provided by operating activities
was$73
millioncompared
to$47
million in 2003.
The $26
million increase reflects growth in net income of $66 million, an increase in
income tax benefit from exercise of stock options of $10 million and the
absence of $11 million in other income realized in Company stock in the
settlement of the SMX litigation in 2003, partially offset by increases in
accounts receivable of $46 million, and deferred income tax benefit of $16
million. 19 Net cash
used by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $99
million, compared to $152 million in 2003 primarily due to a reduction in net
investment purchases of $78 million.
Net cash
provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $11
million compared to $230 million in 2003 due to a reduction in the proceeds
from issuance of stock of $232 million.
We
believe that our working capital, together with anticipated cash flow from our
operations, will be sufficient to fund our long-term liquidity requirements. Contractual
Obligations and Commercial Commitments
The
Company is party to capital leases on automotive and other equipment with an

purchases. 20 Critical
Accounting Policies
In
response to the SECs financial reporting release, FR-60, Cautionary
Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting
Policies, we have
selected our critical accounting policies for purposes of explaining the
methodology used in the calculation in addition to any inherent uncertainties
pertaining to the possible effects on our financial condition. The critical
policies discussed below are our processes of recognizing the allowance
for obsolete and slow-moving inventory, the allowance for doubtful accounts,
income tax, and the reserve for warranties. These policies affect current assets
and operating results and are therefore critical in assessing our financial and
operating status. These policies involve certain assumptions that, if incorrect,
could create an adverse impact on our operations and financial
position.
The
Reserve for Obsolescence
Since the
amount of inventoriable cost that we will truly recoup through sales cannot be
known with exact certainty, we rely upon both past sales experience and future
sales forecasts. Inventory is considered obsolete if we have withdrawn those
products from the market or if we had no sales of the product for the past 12
months, and have no sales forecasted for the next 12 months. Accordingly, a
reserve in an amount equal to 100% of the average cost of such inventory is
recorded in order to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value. The
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We
perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and adjust their credit ratings
accordingly. We continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers
and maintain an allowance for un-collectible amounts based on its historical
experience and any other issues it has identified. While such credit losses have
historically been within its expectations, we cannot guarantee this will
continue in the future. 21 Income
Taxes
We review
our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to evaluate their recoverability
based on projections of the turnaround timing of our deferred tax liabilities,
projections of future taxable income, and tax planning strategies that we might
employ to utilize such assets, including net operating loss carryforwards. Based
on the positive and negative evidence described in Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting
for Income Taxes SFAS
109, we establish a valuation allowance against the net deferred assets of a
taxing jurisdiction in which we operate unless it is more likely than not that
we will recover such assets through the above means. In the future, our
evaluation of the need for the valuation allowance will be significantly
influenced by our ability to achieve profitability and our ability to predict
and achieve future projections of taxable income. 
The
Company operates in a number of different countries around the world. In 2003
the Company began to manufacture its products in Switzerland, where it has
received a permanent income tax rate commitment from the Swiss government as an
incentive to establish a manufacturing plant there. The Company does not provide
deferred tax assets on temporary differences scheduled to reverse after the
commitment period because all of its earnings are included in the current tax
provision. Approximately 60% of all finished goods shipments come from the Swiss
plant, with the balance coming from the Companys manufacturing facilities
located in the United States. 
Significant
judgment is required in determine our worldwide provision for income taxes. In
the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions for which
the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. We have appropriately reserved for our
tax uncertainties based on the criteria established by SFAS 5, Accounting
for loss contingencies. Some of
the uncertainties arise as a result of inter-company arrangements to share
revenue and costs. In such arrangements there are uncertainties about the amount
and manner of such sharing, which could ultimately result in changes once the
arrangements are reviewed by taxing authorities.
The
Reserve for Warranties
The
Company establishes a liability for included twelve-month warranties by the
creation of a warranty reserve, which is an estimate of the repair expenses
likely to be incurred for the remaining period of warranty measured in
installation-months in each major product group. Warranty reserve is reflected
in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The
warranty expense is estimated by determining the total repair expenses for each
product group in the period and determining a rate of repair expense per
installation month. The rate is multiplied by the number of machine-months of
warranty for each product group sold during the period to determine the
provision for warranty expenses for the period. The Company reevaluates its
exposure to warranty costs at the end of each period using the estimated expense
per installation month for each major product group, the number of machines
remaining under warranty and the remaining number of months each machine will be
under warranty. While such expenses have historically been within its
expectations, we cannot guarantee this will continue in the future. 22 Transactions with Related and Other
Parties
The
Company leases its headquarters in Lake Mary, Florida from Xenon Research, Inc.,
all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of which is owned by Simon Raab,
the Company Chief Executive Officer, and Diana Raab, his spouse. The term of
the lease expires on February28, 2006, and the Company hasa
five-year renewal option. Base rent under the lease was$398,000for 2004,
2003 and 2002. Base rent during renewal periods will reflect changes in the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for all Urban
Consumers.
In May
1998, the Company acquired CATS GmbH, a German company CATS. On June 20, 2000
the Company and each of the former CATS shareholders entered into an Amended and
Restated Loan Agreement pursuant to which the Company granted loans to the
former CATS shareholders in the aggregate amount of $11 million The Loans.
The Loans outstanding were for a term of three years, at an interest rate of
approximately 47%, and granted the borrowers an option to extend the term for
an additional three years. The loans were repaid to the Company in
2003.
The
Company engaged Cole Partners, a mergers and acquisition and corporate
finance advisory service firm, to serve as the Companys financial advisor in
connection with the Companys acquisition in January 2002 of SMX. Stephen R.
Cole, one of the Companys directors and member of the Audit Committee, is the
founding partner and president of Cole Partners. The Company paid Cole
Partners total fees of $450,000 for its services, of which the final
payment of $300,000 was paid in 2002. No fees were paid to Cole Partners
in 2004 or 2003.
Foreign
Exchange Exposure
We
conduct a significant portion of our business outside the United States. At
present, approximately 50% of our revenues are invoiced, and a significant
portion of our operating expenses paid, in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in
exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and such foreign currencies may have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition, and could specifically result in foreign exchange gains and losses.
The impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on the results of our operations
cannot be accurately predicted. To the extent that the percentage of our
non-U.S. dollar revenues derived from international sales increases or
decreases in the future, our exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates may increase or decrease. 
Inflation
The
Company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its results of
operations in recent years and does not expect inflation to have a material
impact on its operations in 2005.
Impact
of Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
In
January 2003, the FASB issued and subsequently revised in December of 2003, FIN
46, Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities FIN
46. This
interpretation of ARB No. 51, Consolidated
Financial Statements,
addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities.
Under current practice, two enterprises generally have been included in
consolidated financial statements because one enterprise controls the other
through voting interests. FIN 46 defines the concept of variable interests and
requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated
by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse the
risks among the parties involved. FIN 46 applied immediately to variable
interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest
entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applied
to the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to
variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that
it acquired before February 1, 2003. FIN 46R deferred the effective date of
FIN 46 to the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. If it is
reasonably possible that an enterprise will consolidate or disclose information
about a variable interest entity when this interpretation becomes effective, the
enterprise shall disclose information about those entities in all financial
statements issued after January 31, 2003. FIN 46 may be applied prospectively
with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied
or by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years
with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year
restated. In light of current proposed changes to FIN 46, we are continuing our
assessment to determine whether we are party to any variable interest entities. 23 In May
2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
150,Accounting
for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity. SFAS No.
150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain
financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS
No. 150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within
its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances. SFAS No. 150 was
effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15,
2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material impact on our
financial position or results of operations.
In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory
Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS
No. 151 retains the general principle of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory
Pricing, that
inventories are presumed to be stated at cost; however, it amends ARB No. 43 to
clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facilities, freight, handling costs and
spoilage should be recognized as current period expenses. Also, SFAS No. 151
requires fixed overhead costs be allocated to inventories based on normal
production capacity. The guidance in SAFS No. 151 is effective for inventory
costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company
believes that implementing SFAS No. 151 will not have a material impact on its
financial position or results of operations.
In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based
Payment. SFAS
No. 123R requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under
stock participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method, and
eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic
value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, as allowed under the original
provisions of SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 123R requires the use of an option pricing
model for estimating fair value, which is amortized to expense over the service
periods. The requirements of SFAS No. 123R are effective for fiscal periods
beginning after June 15, 2005. If the Company had applied the provisions of SFAS
No. 123 to the financial statements for the period ending December 31, 2004, net
income would have been reduced by approximately $12 million using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. We expect to incur expenses of approximately
$2 million in 2005 as calculated under the Black-Scholes method of SFAS
123, related to our expected adoption of SFAS No. 123R for the
expensing of stock options. We are investigating other valuation methods for
these expenses prior to our adoption of SFAS 123R.
Cautionary
Statements
We
discuss expectations regarding our future performance and make other
forward-looking statements in our annual and quarterly reports, press releases
and other written and oral statements. These forward-looking statements are
based on currently available competitive, financial and economic data and our
operating plans. They are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize
that events could turn out to be significantly different from our expectations.
The following discussion of risks and uncertainties which is not exclusive,
highlights some important factors to consider when evaluating our trends and
future results. 24 Our
customers' buying process for our products is highly decentralized, and
therefore, it typically requires significant time and expense for us to further
penetrate the potential market of a specific customer, which may delay our
ability to generate additional revenue. 
Our
success will depend, in part, on our ability to further penetrate our customer
base. During 2004, 527% of our revenue was attributable to sales to our
existing customers, compared to 546% in 2003. If we are not able to continue to
penetrate our existing customer base, our sales growth will be impaired. Most of
our customers have a decentralized buying process for measurement devices. Thus,
we must spend significant time and resources to increase revenues from a
specific customer. For example, we may provide products to only one of our
customers manufacturing facilities or for a specific product line within a
manufacturing facility. We cannot be certain that we will be ableto
maintain or increase the amount of sales to our existing customers. Others
may develop products that make our products obsolete or less competitive. The CAM2
market is emerging and could be characterized by rapid technological change.
Others may develop new or improved products, processes or technologies that may
make our products obsolete or less competitive. We cannot assure you that we
will be able to adapt to evolving markets and technologies or maintain our
technological advantage.
Our
success will depend, in part, on our ability to maintain our technological
advantage by developing new products and applications and enhancing our existing
products. Developing new products and applications and enhancing our existing
products can be complex and time-consuming and will require substantial
investment by us. Significant delays in new product releases or difficulties in
developing new products could adversely affect our revenues and results of
operations. Because our customers are concentrated in a few industries, a
reduction in sales to any one of these industries could cause a significant
decline in our revenues.
An
economic slowdown in manufacturing will affect our growth and profitability. Approximately
75% of our sales are to manufacturers in the automotive, aerospace and heavy
equipment industries. We are dependent upon the continued growth, viability and
financial stability of our customers in these industries, which are highly
cyclical and dependent upon the general health of the economy and consumer
spending. The cyclical nature of these industries may exert significant
influence on our revenues and results of operations. In addition, the volume of
orders from our customers and the prices of our products may be adversely
impacted by decreases in capital spending by a significant portion of our
customers during recessionary periods. In addition, we generate significant
accounts receivable in connection with providing products and services to our
customers. If one or more of our significant customers were to become insolvent
or otherwise were unable to pay for the products provided by us, our operating
results and financial condition would be adversely affected. 
The
potential size and growth of the CAM2 market could be less than we anticipate. Because
the CAM2 market is emerging, the potential size and growth of the CAM2 market is
uncertain and difficult to quantify. If the CAM2 market does not continue to
expand or does not expand at least as quickly as we anticipate, we will not be
able to continue our sales growth, which will affect our
profitability. 25 Our
inability to protect our patents and proprietary rights in the United States and
foreign countries could adversely affect our revenues. 
Our
success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and
other proprietary right protection for our processes and products in the United
States and other countries. We also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how
and continuing inventions to maintain our competitive position. We seek to
protect our technology and trade secrets, in part, by confidentiality agreements
with our employees and contractors. Our employees may breach these agreements or
our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by
inventors. If we are unable to obtain or maintain protection of our patents,
trade secrets and other proprietary rights, we may not be able to prevent third
parties from using our proprietary rights. 
Our
patent protection involves complex legal and technical questions. Our patents
may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. We may be able to
protect our proprietary rights from infringement by third parties only to the
extent that our proprietary processes and products are covered by valid and
enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. Furthermore,
others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design
around our patented technologies. Litigation or other proceedings to defend or
enforce our intellectual property rights could require us to spend significant
time and money and could otherwise adversely affect our business. 
Claims
from others that we infringe their intellectual property rights may adversely
affect our operations. 
From time
to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual
property rights. The number of these claims may grow. Responding to these claims
may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable
terms, require us to stop selling or to redesign affected products or require us
to pay damages. Any litigation or interference proceedings, regardless of their
outcome, may be costly and may require significant time and attention of our
management and technical personnel. 
Our
operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors, many of which are
beyond our control. 
Our
annual and quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and
likely will vary significantly in the future as a result of:  
the
size and timing of customer orders, many of which are received towards the
end of the quarter;  
sales
promotions and sales of demonstration
equipment  
geographic
expansion in the Asia/Pacific region and other
regions  
training
and ramp-up time for new sales people  
investments
in technologies and new products  
our
effective tax rate  
the
amount of time that it takes to fulfill orders and ship our products;
the
length of our sales cycle to new customers and the time and expense
incurred in further penetrating our existing customer base;
26  
increases
in operating expenses for product development and new product marketing;
costs
associated with new product introductions, such as assembly line start-up
costs and low introductory period production volumes  
the
timing and market acceptance of new products and product enhancements;
customer
order deferrals in anticipation of new products and product enhancements;
our
success in expanding our sales and marketing programs  
start-up
costs and ramp-up time associated with opening new sales offices outside
of the United States;  
fluctuations
in revenue without proportionate adjustments in fixed costs;
the
efficiencies achieved in managing inventories and fixed assets; and
adverse
changes in the manufacturing industry and general economic conditions.
Any one
or a combination of these factors could adversely affect our annual and
quarterly operating results in the future. 
The
CAM2 market is an emerging market and our growth depends on the ability of our
products to attain broad market acceptance. 
The CAM2
market is in an early stage of adoption. The market for traditional fixed-base
CMMs, check fixtures, and other handheld measurement tools is mature. Part of
our strategy is to continue to displace these traditional measurement devices.
Displacing traditional measurement devices and achieving broad market acceptance
of our products requires significant effort to convince manufacturers to
reevaluate their historical measurement procedures and methodologies. We market
four closely interdependent products Faro Arm, Scan Arm, Faro Laser Tracker and
Faro Gage and related software for use in measurement and inspection
applications. Substantially all our revenues are currently derived from sales of
these products and software and we plan to continue our business strategy of
focusing on the portable software-driven, 3-D measurement and inspection market.
Consequently, our financial performance will depend in large part on portable,
computer-based measurement and inspection products achieving broad market
acceptance. If our products cannot attain broad market acceptance, we will not
grow as anticipated and may be required to make increased 
expenditures
on research and development for new applications or new products. 
We
compete with manufacturers of portable measurement systems and traditional
measurement devices, many of which have more resources than us and may develop
products or technologies that will directly compete with us. 
Our
portable measurement systems compete in the broad market for measurement devices
for manufacturing and industrial applications, which, in addition to portable
articulated arms and laser tracker products, consists of fixed-base CMMs, check
fixtures, and handheld measurement tools. The broad market for measurement
devices is highly competitive. In the Faro Gage product line, manufacturers of
handheld measurement tools and fixed-base CMMs include a significant number of
well-established companies that are substantially larger and possess
substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we
possess. In the Faro Arm product line, we compete with Hexagon Metrology, who is
significantly larger than us. In the Faro Laser Tracker product line, we compete
primarily with Leica Geosystems, who is significantly larger than us. We will be
required to make continued investments in technology and product development to
maintain our technological advantage over our competition. We cannot assure you
that we will have sufficient resources to make additional investments in
technology and product development or that our product development efforts will
allow us to successfully compete as the industry evolves. 27 Our
competitors may develop products or technologies that directly compete with us.
For example, fixed-base CMM manufacturers are introducing CAD-based inspection
software in response to the trend toward CAD-based factory floor metrology. In
addition, some fixed-base CMM manufacturers are miniaturizing and increasing the
mobility of their conventional CMMs. These companies may continue to alter their
products and devote resources to the development and marketing of additional
products that compete with ours. 
We
derive a substantial part of our revenues from our international operations,
which are subject to greater volatility and often require more management time
and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations. Since
2000, we have derived approximately 50% of our sales from international
operations. We opened a manufacturing facility in Schaffhausen, Switzerland in
2003 and have regional sales offices in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Japan,
China, India, South Korea and the United Kingdom. Should trade relations between
the United States and China deteriorate, our ability to transfer products
between China and other regions of the world, including the United States, Asia
and Europe could be significantly impaired and our results of operations would
suffer. In our experience, entry into new international markets requires
considerable management time as well as start-up expenses for market
development, hiring and establishing office facilities before any significant
revenues are generated. As a result, initial operations in a new market may
operate at low margins or may be unprofitable. Our international operations may
be subject to a number of risks including:  
difficulties
in staffing and managing foreign operations  
political
and economic instability;  
unexpected
changes in regulatory requirements and laws  
longer
customer payment cycles and difficulty collecting accounts receivable;
export
duties, import controls and trade barriers  
governmental
restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside
the United States;  
burdens
of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices;
and  
fluctuations
in currency exchange rates, which could affect local payroll utility and
other expenses. 28 Several
of the countries where we operate have emerging or developing economies, which
may be subject to greater currency volatility, negative growth, high inflation,
limited availability of foreign exchange and other risks. These factors may harm
our results of operations and any measures that we may implement to reduce the
effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our international operations
may not be effective. In addition, during 1997 and 1998 several Asian countries,
including Japan, experienced severe currency fluctuation and economic deflation.
If such situations reoccur or occur in other regions where we operate, it may
negatively impact our sales and our ability to collect payments from customers
in these regions. 
We
rely to a large extent on the experience and management ability of our senior
executive officers. 
Our
success will depend, in part, on the services of our founders, Simon Raab, our
Chief Executive Officer, and Gregory Fraser, our Executive Vice President,
Secretary and Treasurer, and Jay Freeland, our President and Chief Operating
Officer, who was hired in November 2004, and our Chief Financial Officer,
Barbara Smith, who was hired in February 2005. The loss or interruption of the
continued full-time services of these executives could have a material adverse
effect on us. We do not have employment agreements with these executives. We
may not be able to identify, consummate or achieve expected benefits from
acquisitions. 
We have
completed two significant acquisitions since our initial public offering in
1997. We intend to pursue access to additional technologies, complementary
product lines and sales channels through selective acquisitions and strategic
investments. We may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable
acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or
otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. In the past we have used our
stock as consideration for acquisitions. Our common stock may not remain at a
price at which it can be used as consideration for acquisitions without diluting
our existing shareholders, and potential acquisition candidates may not view our
stock attractively. 
Realization
of the benefits of acquisitions often requires integration of some or all of the
acquired companies' sales and marketing, distribution, manufacturing,
engineering, finance and administrative organizations. The integration of
acquisitions demands substantial attention from senior management and the
management of the acquired companies. Any acquisition may be subject to a
variety of risks and uncertainties including:  
the
inability to assimilate effectively the operations, products, technologies
and personnel of the acquired companies some of which may be located in
diverse geographic regions;  
the
inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and
policies;  
the
need or obligation to divest portions of the acquired companies; and
the
potential impairment of relationships with customers. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to integrate successfully any acquisitions, that
any acquired companies will operate profitably or that we will realize the
expected benefits from any acquisition. 
We
may face difficulties managing growth. 
Our
growth has placed significant demands on our management and operations and
financial resources. If our business continues to grow rapidly in the future, we
expect it to result in: 29  
increased
responsibility for existing and new management personnel; and
incremental
strain on our operations and financial and management systems.
Our
success under such conditions will depend to a significant extent on the ability
of our executive officers and other members of senior management to operate
effectively both independently and as a group. If we are not able to manage
future growth, our business, financial condition and operating results may be
harmed. 
Our
dependence on suppliers for materials could impair our ability to manufacture
our products. 
Outside
vendors provide key components used by us in the manufacture of our products.
Although we believe that alternative sources for these components are available,
any supply interruption in a limited source component would harm our ability to
manufacture our products until a new source of supply is identified. In
addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier variation in a component, either
known or unknown to us, or incompatible with our manufacturing processes, could
harm our ability to manufacture our products. We may not be able to find a
sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonable period, or on commercially
reasonable terms, if at all. If we fail to obtain a supplier for the manufacture
of components of our potential products, we may experience delays or
interruptions in our operations, which would adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition. 
We
may experience volatility in our stock price. 
The price
of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile in
response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including  
developments
in the industries in which we operate;  
actual
or anticipated variations in quarterly or annual operating results;
speculation
in the press or investment community; and  
announcements
of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors.
Our
common stock market price may also be affected by our inability to meet
analyst and investor expectations and failure to achieve projected financial
results, including those set forth in this prospectus. Any failure to meet such
expectations or projected financial results, even if minor, could cause the
market price of our common stock to decline. Volatility in our stock price may
result in your inability to sell your shares at or above the price at which you
purchased them. 
In
addition, stock markets have generally experienced a high level of price and
volume volatility, and the market prices of equity securities of many companies
have experienced wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the
operating performance of such companies. These broad market fluctuations may
adversely affect our common stock market price. In the past, securities class
action lawsuits frequently have been instituted against such companies following
periods of volatility in the market price of such companies' securities. If any
such litigation is instigated against us, it could result in substantial costs
and a diversion of management attention and resources, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. 
Our
executive officers and directors control a significant percentage of our common
stock and these shareholders may take actions that are adverse to your
interests. 30 Our two
co-founders, Simon Raab and Gregory Fraser, beneficially own approximately
1924% of our common stock. As a result, these shareholders, acting together,
can significantly influence all matters requiring shareholder approval,
including the election and removal of directors and approval of significant
corporate transactions such as mergers, consolidations and sales of assets. They
also could dictate the management of our business and affairs. This
concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying, deferring or
preventing a change in control or impeding a merger or consolidation, takeover
or other business combination, which could cause the market price of our common
stock to fall or prevent you from receiving a premium in such a transaction. Anti-takeover
provisions in our articles of incorporation, our bylaws and provisions of
Florida law could delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor. Our
articles of incorporation, our bylaws and provisions of Florida law could make
it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be
beneficial to you. These provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts
and could adversely affect the market price of our shares. Because of these
provisions, you might not be able to receive a premium on your investment. These
provisions include:  
a
limitation on shareholders' ability to call a special meeting of our
shareholders;  
advance
notice requirements to nominate directors for election to our board of
directors or to propose matters that can be acted on by shareholders at
shareholder meetings;  
our
classified board of directors, which means that approximately one-third of
our directors are elected each year; and  
the
authority of the board of directors to issue, without shareholder
approval, preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may
determine. 
The
provisions described above could delay or make more difficult transactions
involving a change in control of us, or our management.
Item
7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk. Foreign
Exchange Exposure
The
Company conducts a significant portion of its business outside the United
States. At present, a slight majority of the Companys revenues are invoiced,
and a significant portion of its operating expenses paid, in foreign currencies.
Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and such foreign
currencies may have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results
of operations and financial condition, and could specifically result in foreign
exchange gains and losses. The impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on
the results of the Companys operations cannot be accurately predicted. To the
extent that the percentage of the Companys non-U.S. dollar revenues derived
from international sales increases in the future, the Companys exposure to
risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will increase
further.
Inflation
The
Company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its results of
operations in recent years and does not expect inflation to have a material
impact on its operations in 2004. 31 Item 8.

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
YEARS
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 1.SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Description
of BusinessFARO
Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries collectively the Company develop,
manufacture, market and support Computer Aided Design CAD-based quality
assurance products and CAD-based inspection and statistical process control
software. Its principal products include the Faro Arm and Faro Gage, both
articulated electromechanical measuring devices, and the Faro Laser Tracker, a
multi-axis laser based measuring device. Markets for the Companys products
include automobile, aerospace and heavy equipment manufacturers. The Company
sells the vast majority of its products though a direct sales force located in
many of the worlds largest industrialized countries.
Principles
of ConsolidationThe
consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of FARO
Technologies, Inc. and all its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated. The financial statements of the
foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in
effect at period-end for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates
during each reporting period for results of operations. Adjustments resulting
from translation of financial statements are reflected as a separate component
of accumulated other comprehensive income. 
Revenue
Recognition, Product Warranty and Extended Maintenance
ContractsRevenue
related to the Companys measurement systems integrated combinations of a
measurement device, a computer and software loaded on the computer and the
measurement device is recognized upon shipment as the Company considers the
earnings process substantially complete as of the shipping date. The Company
warrants its products against defects in design, materials and workmanship for
one year. A provision for estimated future costs relating to warranty expenses
is recorded when products are shipped. Also included in the one year warranty is
a right to software upgrades.The Company believesthatit has
appropriately recognized the revenue related to this upgrade right under the
provisions of SOP 97-2. Beginning in 2005, the software upgrade rights are no
longer included in the one year warranty and must be purchased separately. The
Company separately sells one and three year extended warranties. Extended
warranty revenues are recognized in proportion to maintenance costs projected to
be incurred. Costs relating to extended maintenance plans are recognized as
incurred. Revenue from sales of software only is recognized when no further
significant production, modification or customization of the software is
required and when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a sales
agreement exists, delivery has occurred, and the sales price is fixed or
determinable and deemed collectible. Revenues resulting from sales of
comprehensive support, training and technology consulting services are
recognized as such services are performed and are deferred when billed in
advance of the performance of services. Revenue from the licensing agreements
for the use of its technology for medical applications is generally recognized
as licensees use the technology. Amounts representing royalties for the current
year and not received as of year-end, are estimated as due based on historical
data and recognized in the current year. 
Cash
and Cash EquivalentsThe
Company considers cash on hand and amounts on deposit with financial
institutions which have maturities of three months or less when purchased to be
cash and cash equivalents. The Company had deposits with foreign banks totaling
$14,043,782 and $7,632,836 as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Short-term
investmentsShort-term
investments ordinarily consist of short-term debt securities acquired with cash
not immediately needed in operations, and are held at fair value. 
Management
determines the appropriate classification of its short term investments at the
time of the purchase and reevaluates such determinations at each balance sheet
date. The Companys short-term investments are diversified among high credit
quality securities in accordance with the Companys investment policy. 39 Accounts
receivable and related allowance for doubtful accountsCredit is
extended to customers based on an evaluation of a customers financial condition
and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts receivable are generally
due within 30-90 days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an
allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts outstanding longer than the
contractual payment terms are considered past due. The Company makes judgments
as to the collectibility of accounts receivable based on historical trends and
future expectations. Management estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts
which adjusts gross trade accounts receivable to its net realizable value. To
determine the allowance for sales returns, management uses historical trends to
estimate future period product returns. The allowance for doubtful accounts is
based on an analysis of all receivables for possible impairment issues, and
historical write-off percentages. The Company writes-off accounts receivable
when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such
receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company
does not generally charge interest on past due receivables.
InventoriesInventories
are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Shipping and
handling costs are classified as a component of cost of sales in the
consolidated statements of operations. Sales demonstration inventory is
comprised of measuring devices utilized by sales representatives to present the
Companys products to customers. These products remain in sales demonstration
inventory for six to twelve months and are subsequently sold at prices that
produce slightly reduced gross margins. Service inventory is comprised of
inventory that is not expected to be sold within twelve months, such as training
and loaned equipment. 
Property
and EquipmentProperty
and equipment purchases exceeding $1,000 are capitalized and recorded at cost.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the various classes of assets as follows:  
Machinery
and equipment
2
to 5 years
Furniture
and fixtures
3
to 10 years
Leasehold
improvements are amortized on the straight-line basis over the lesser of the
life of the asset or the term of the lease, not to exceed 7 years.
Depreciation
expense was $1,453,103, $1,132,225 and $1,111,095 in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Accelerated methods of depreciation are used for income tax
purposes in contrast to book purposes, and as a result, appropriate provisions
are made for the related deferred income taxes. 
Goodwill
and Intangibles
Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair
value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets,
indefinite-life identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized.
The Company periodically reviews its identifiable intangible assets and
goodwill, considering factors such as projected cash flows and revenue and
earnings multiples, to determine whether the value of the assets are impaired
and the amortization periods are appropriate. If an asset is impaired, the
difference between the value of the asset reflected on the financial statements
and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which
the impairment occurs. 
Other
acquired intangibles principally include core technology, existing product
technology and customer relationships that arose in connection with the
acquisition of CATS GmbH, a German company CATS. Other acquired intangibles
are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition and are amortized over
their estimated useful lives of primarily 3 to 5 years. 40 Patents
are recorded at cost. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method
over the lives of the patents, which is 17 years.
Research
and DevelopmentResearch
and development costs incurred in the discovery of new knowledge and the
resulting translation of this new knowledge into plans and designs for new
products, prior to the attainment of the related products technological
feasibility, are recorded as expenses in the period incurred. 
Income
TaxesDeferred
tax assets and liabilities reflect the future income tax effects of temporary
differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured
using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Temporary items
result primarily from loss carryforwards, tax credits, depreciation,
amortization, and deferred revenue items. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a
valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Fair
Value of Financial InstrumentsThe
Companys financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and accounts receivable. The carrying amounts of such financial
instruments approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these
instruments.
Earnings
Per ShareBasic
earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing earnings available to common
shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted EPS includes the effect of all dilutive stock options and equity
instruments. A reconciliation of the number of common shares used in calculation
of basic and diluted EPS is presented in Note 18.
Concentration
of Credit RiskFinancial
instruments which potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist principally of short-term investments and operating demand deposit
accounts. The Companys policy is to place its operating demand deposit accounts
with high credit quality financial institutions. 
Stock-Based
CompensationIn
December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No.
148, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No.
148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the
fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation. In addition,
SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, to
require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements
about the method of accounting for stock-based compensation and the effect of
the method used on reported results. SFAS No. 148 is effective for financial
statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 and for interim
periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The annual disclosure requirements of
SFAS No. 148 were adopted by the Company on January 1, 2003.
In
accordance with SFAS No. 123, the Company has elected to continue to account for
its employee stock compensation plans using the intrinsic value based method
with pro-forma disclosures of net earnings and earnings per share, as if the
fair value based method of accounting defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied.
Under the intrinsic value based method, compensation cost is measured by the
excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date over
the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. Under the fair value based
method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value
of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the
vesting period. 41 Had
compensation cost for the Companys stock-based compensation plans been
determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Companys net income loss and
earnings loss per share would have been as follows:

In April
2000, the FASB issued FIN 44, Accounting
for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, an Interpretation of APB
Opinion No. 25. FIN 44
clarifies and modifies APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees.
Long-Lived
AssetsEffective
January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS No.
144 supersedes SFAS No. 121 and requires that one accounting impairment model be
used for long-lived assets to be held and used and to be disposed of by sale,
whether previously held and used or newly acquired, and broadens the
presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions.
The adoption of SFAS No. 144 had no financial impact on the results of
operations or financial position of the Company.
EstimatesThe
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 42 Foreign
Exchange Rate Swap AgreementIn
September 2002, the Company entered into a foreign exchange rate swap allowing
the Company the right to purchase up to $18 million at a base rate of 10444
Euros per $100. Under the agreement, the Company and the bank are to compensate
one another based on the exchange rate agreement differential at specified
measurement dates. This foreign exchange rate agreement did not qualify for
special hedge accounting treatment. Therefore the changes in fair value were
included in the determination of earnings. 
This
foreign exchange rate agreement, set to expire in September 2003, was terminated
in December 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company
recognized a loss of $105,000 related to the change in fair value and the
subsequent termination of the foreign exchange rate agreement. This loss is
included in other income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations. There was no activity in 2004 or 2003 relating to foreign exchange
rate swap agreements.
Impact
of Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In
January 2003, the FASB issued and subsequently revised in December of 2003, FIN
46, Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities. This
interpretation of ARB No. 51, Consolidated
Financial Statements,
addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities.
Under current practice, two enterprises generally have been included in
consolidated financial statements because one enterprise controls the other
through voting interests. FIN 46 defines the concept of variable interests and
requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated
by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse the
risks among the parties involved. FIN 46 applied immediately to variable
interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest
entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applied
in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to
variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that
it acquired before February 1, 2003. FIN 46R deferred the effective date of
FIN 46 to the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. If it is
reasonably possible that an enterprise will consolidate or disclose information
about a variable interest entity when this interpretation becomes effective, the
enterprise shall disclose information about those entities in all financial
statements issued after January 31, 2003. FIN 46 may be applied prospectively
with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied
or by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years
with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year
restated. In light of current proposed changes to FIN 46, we are continuing our
assessment to determine whether we are party to any variable interest entities. In May
2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting
for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity. SFAS No.
150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain
financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS
No. 150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within
its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances. SFAS No. 150 was
effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15,
2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material impact on our
financial position or results of operations.
In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory
Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No.
151 retains the general principle of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory
Pricing, that
inventories are presumed to be stated at cost; however, it amends ARB No. 43 to
clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facilities, freight, handling costs and
spoilage should be recognized as current period expenses. Also, SFAS No. 151
requires fixed overhead costs be allocated to inventories based on normal
production capacity. The guidance in SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory
costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company
believes that implementing SFAS No. 151 will not have a material impact on its
financial position or results of operations.
In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based
Payment. SFAS No.
123R requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock
participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method, and
eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic
value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, as allowed under the original
provisions of SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 123R requires the use of an option pricing
model for estimating fair value, which is amortized to expense over the service
periods. The requirements of SFAS No. 123R are effective for fiscal periods
beginning after June 15, 2005. Net income in the financial statements for the
period ending December 31, 2004, would have been reduced by approximately
$12 million using the Black-Scholes option pricing model as applied under SFAS
123. This amount may change, as management is in the process of assessing the
various option pricing models allowed under SFAS No. 123R. 43 Reclassification-Certain
2003 and 2002 amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2004
presentation. 2.
ACQUISITION
On
January 16, 2002, the Company acquired SpatialMetriX Corporation SMX in
exchange for 500,000 shares of FARO common stock and the satisfaction by the
Company of certain obligations of SMX. In connection therewith, the Company
issued an additional 350,000 shares of FARO common stock and paid $20 million
in cash to fully satisfy SMXs obligations to its two lenders. The value
attributed to the 500,000 and 350,000 shares of FARO common stock was $1,125,000
and $787,500, respectively based on the market value of the stock on January 16,
2002 represented by the $225 closing price of the stock on the NASDAQ stock
exchange. The Company also assumed and/or satisfied other obligations of SMX.
The transaction was recorded utilizing the purchase method of accounting in
accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business
Combinations.

7.GOODWILL The
Companys goodwill at December 31, 2004 and 2003 is related to its acquisition
of two previous businesses. The Company tests for goodwill impairment in
accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets. The
Company evaluates each reporting units fair value versus its carrying value in
the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair value. When
estimating the reporting units fair value, the Company utilizes gross profit
for each reporting unit and a multiple based on industry averages for each
reporting unit and compares this against the carrying value. Impairments to
goodwill are charged against earnings in the period the impairment is
identified. The Company has two reporting units for which goodwill was tested on
December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company did not have
any goodwill that was identified as impaired. The increase decrease in
goodwill of $75,250 and $168,590 in 2004 and 2003, respectively relates
entirely to the translation of foreign currency balances.

party leaseThe
Company leases its plant and office building from Xenon Research, Inc., all of
the issued and outstanding capital stock of which is owned by Simon Raab, our
Chief Executive Officer, and Diana Raab, his spouse. The term of the lease
expires on February 28, 2006, with a five-year renewal option. The base rent
during renewal periods will reflect changes in the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics, Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers. Rent expense under
this lease was approximately
$398,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002. The Company is evaluating the potential impact
of FIN 46R on the accounting for the assets subject to this
lease.
Related
party loansIn May
1998, the Company acquired CATS. On June 20, 2000 the Company and each of the
former CATS shareholders entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement

At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Companys domestic entities had deferred income
tax assets in the amount of $3,306,378 and $1,708,587, respectively. The Company
has determined that these amounts are fully realizable and have not established
any valuation allowance based on the assessment that they are
more-likely-than-not to be utilized. 50 At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Companys foreign subsidiaries had deferred
income tax assets relating to net operating loss carry forwards, which do not
expire, of $3,358,630 and $4,838,235, respectively. For financial reporting
purposes, a valuation allowance of $1,647,188 and $4,838,235, respectively has
been recognized to offset the deferred tax assets relating to net operating
losses. The Company has determined that the amount of deferred tax assets
relating to the net operating loss carryforwards of foreign subsidiaries was
understated at December 31, 2003. The understatement was due to the tax
treatment of intercompany debt waivers that were determined in 2004 to be exempt
from tax, and resulted in an adjustment to beginning balances of approximately
$37 million for deferred tax assets relating to the net operating loss
carryforwards and has been reflected in the above schedule of deferred income
tax assets as of December 31, 2003. As these net operating loss carryforwards
would have been fully reserved at December 31, 2003 by a valuation allowance,
there is no income statement or balance sheet impact to be recognized for 2003. The
Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance on net operating losses in
jurisdictions for which it does not have a history of earnings over the last
three years and where the Company believes that the deferred tax assets are not
more-likely-than-not to be realized. The Company reduced the overall valuation
allowance in 2004 and 2003 on its deferred tax assets in the amount of
$3,191,047 and $3,973,812, respectively. The reduction in the valuation
allowance for 2004 relates to the net use of deferred tax assets in foreign
jurisdictions and to the release of $1,713,347 in valuation allowance in a
foreign jurisdiction in the fourth quarter. The release of the valuation
allowance was based on one of its foreign units having demonstrated a history of
earnings over the past three years, and with managements assessment that the
unit will be more-likely-than-not to utilize their deferred tax assets.
Management calculated the amount to release from the valuation allowance using
projections of future taxable earnings over the next two years. 
At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had $1,018,854 and $675,132 in tax
credits, respectively. These credits are related to the Companys research and
development activities and expire in 17 to 20 years. The Company fully expects
to realize these credits before expiration.
The
Company operates in a number of different countries around the world. In 2003
the Company began to manufacture its products in Switzerland, where it has
received a permanent income tax rate commitment from the Swiss government as an
incentive to establish a manufacturing plant there. The Company does not provide
deferred tax assets on temporary differences scheduled to reverse after the
commitment period because all of its earnings are included in the current tax
provision. Approximately 60% of all finished goods shipments come from the Swiss
plant, with the balance coming from the Companys manufacturing facilities
located in the United States.
We have
not recognized any U.S. tax expense on undistributed international earnings
since we intend to reinvest the earnings outside the U.S. for the foreseeable
future. Our undistributed international earnings were approximately $54 million
and $28 million at December 31, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
Significant
judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In
the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions for which
the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The Company reviews its tax contingencies
on a regular basis and makes appropriate accruals as necessary.

SHARE ISSUANCE 
On
November 12, 2003, the Company sold 1,158,000 shares of its common stock, and
two of the Companys founders sold 772,000 shares of the Companys common stock
to institutional investors in a private placement that was not registered under
the Securities Act of 1933. The shares were sold for $2150 per share, resulting
in total proceeds before placement agent fees and other offering expenses of
$249 million and $166 million to the Company and the co-founders,
respectively. The purchasers of the shares sold in the transaction were 31
institutional investors. Robert W. Baird Co. served as the placement agent
for the transaction, and received a fee equal to $2,489,700, or 6% of the
aggregate sales proceeds. The Company also reimbursed Robert W. Baird Co.
for $50,000 in expenses incurred in connection with the transaction. 51 16.

a 3-year period. The Company is also authorized to grant up to 250,000 shares of
common stock under the 1997 Non-employee Director Plan of which 84,000 options
are currently outstanding at exercise prices between $161 and $2156. Each
non-employee director is granted 3,000 options upon election to the Board of
Directors and then annually upon attending the annual meeting of shareholders
formula options. Formula options granted to directors are generally granted
upon the same terms and conditions as options granted to officers and employees.
These options vest over a 3-year period. The Company is also authorized to grant
options for up to 1,750,000 shares of common stock under the 2004 Plan, of which
599,372 options are currently outstanding at exercise prices between $1934 to
$2435. These options vest over a 3-year period.
In
addition to the four stock option plans, the Company has the 1997 Non-Employee
Directors Fee Plan 1997 Fee Plan under which the Company is authorized to
issue up to 250,000 shares of Common Stock and permits non-employee directors to
elect to receive directors fees in the form of common stock rather than cash.
Common stock issued in lieu of cash directors fees is issued at the end of the
quarter in which the fees are earned, with the number of shares being based on
the fair market value of the common stock for the five trading days immediately
preceding the last business day of the quarter. The 1997 Fee Plan also permits
non-employee directors to irrevocably elect to defer receipt of all or any
portion of the shares of common stock which would otherwise be payable. As of
December 31, 2004 and 2003 there were 35,941 shares accrued but not yet issued
in connection with directors elections. 52 In the
fourth quarter of 2001, the Company cancelled approximately 548,000 out of the
money options, including approximately 440,000 options issued under the 1997
Plan and approximately 108,000 options issued under the 1997 Non-employee
Director Plan. As a result, 62,806 options granted in 2001, under the 1997 Plan
and to holders of some of the options cancelled, were subjected to variable
accounting treatment. Under FIN 44, stock options issued within six months of a
cancellation must be accounted for as variable under certain circumstances.
Variable accounting requires companies to re-measure compensation costs for the
variable options based on the Companys share price until the options are
exercised, cancelled or forfeited without replacement. Compensation is dependent
on fluctuations in the quoted market prices for the Companys common stock. Such
compensation costs will be recognized over a three-year vesting schedule until
the options are fully vested, exercised, cancelled or forfeited, after which
time the compensation will be recognized immediately at each reporting period. Compensation
costs charged to operations associated with the Companys stock option plans
were $277,028, $718,524,and
$9,526 in
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The changes in stock option associated
compensation cost were due
to the market price fluctuation in the Companys common stock.
