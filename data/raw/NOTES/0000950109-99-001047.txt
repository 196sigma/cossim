1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization--CuraGen Corporation the Company or CuraGen is a
biotechnology company focusing on the application of genomics to the systematic
discovery of genes, biological pathways and drug candidates in order to
accelerate the discovery and development of the next generation of therapeutic,
agricultural and diagnostic products. The Company was incorporated in November
1991 and, until March 1993, was engaged primarily in organizational activities,
research and development of the Company technology, grant preparation and
obtaining financing.
Revenue Recognition--The Company has entered into certain collaborative
research agreements which provide for the partial or complete funding of
specified projects in exchange for access to and certain rights in the resultant
data discovered under the related project. Revenue is recognized based upon work
performed or upon the attainment of certain benchmarks specified in the related
agreements see Note 4. Grant revenue is recognized as related costs qualifying
under the terms of the grants are incurred. Grant revenue is derived solely from
federal and Connecticut agencies see Note 7. Deferred revenue arising from
payments received from grants and collaborative agreements is recognized as
income when earned.
Cash and Cash Equivalents--The Company considers investments readily
convertible into cash with a maturity of three months or less at the date of
purchase to be cash equivalents.
Property and Equipment--Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Equipment
under capital leases is recorded at the lower of the net present value of the
minimum lease payments required over the term of the lease or the fair value of
the assets at the inception of the lease. Additions, renewals and betterments
that significantly extend the life of an asset are capitalized. Minor
replacements, maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.
Equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets,
ranging from three to seven years, using the straight-line method. Equipment
under capital leases is amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life
or the terms of the lease, using the straight-line method. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the term of the lease, using the straight-line
method. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related
accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the accounts and
any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income. For income tax purposes,
depreciation is computed using various accelerated methods and, in some cases,
different useful lives than those used for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred Real Estate Commissions--Deferred real estate commissions were paid
in January 1997 in connection with the signing of the operating lease in New
Haven, Connecticut see Note 3. These costs, which are included in Other
assets, are amortized over the remaining life of the lease as of the date of
occupancy, 69 months, using the straight-line method. Accumulated amortization
aggregated $8,993 and $20,984, respectively, as of December 31, 1997 and 1998.
Licensing Fees--Licensing fees for various research and development purposes
were paid during 1998. The costs, which are included in Other assets, are
amortized over the lives of the licenses. Accumulated amortization and related
amortization expense aggregated $30,288 as of December 31, 1998.
Patent Application Costs--Costs incurred in filing for patents are charged to
operations, until such time as it is determined that the filing will be
successful. When it becomes evident with reasonable certainty that an
application will be successful, the costs incurred in filing for patents will
begin to be capitalized. Capitalized costs related to successful patent
applications will be amortized over a period not to exceed twenty years or the
remaining life of the patent, whichever is shorter, using the straight-line
method. During 1996, 1997, and 1998, all patent application costs have been
charged to operations.
Research and Development Costs--Research and development costs are charged to
operations as incurred. Grant research expenses include all direct research and
development costs incurred related to specific grant awards and programs. All
remaining research and development costs are incurred for the development and
maintenance of current and future research collaboration agreements, and
accordingly, have been classified as collaborative research and development
expenses.
Stock-Based Compensation--In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123, which was effective for the Company
beginning January 1, 1996. SFAS 123 requires expanded disclosures of stock-based
compensation arrangements with employees and non-employees and encourages but
does not require compensation cost to be measured based on the fair value of
the equity instruments awarded to employees. Companies are permitted to continue
to apply Accounting Principles Board APB No. 25, which recognizes
compensation cost based on the intrinsic value of the equity instruments
awarded. The Company will continue to
24
apply APB No. 25 to its stock-based compensation awards to employees. For equity
instruments awarded to non-employees, the Company records the transactions based
upon the consideration received for such awards or the fair value of the equity
instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The Company recorded
stock-based compensation expense attributable to non-employees totaling $96,318 277,247 and $289,752 for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998,
respectively. For options issued to employees, the Company records the
transactions based upon the difference between the option strike price and the
estimated fair market value as of the date of issuance. Stock-based compensation
associated with options granted to employees during 1997 amounted to $1,672,998
and is being expensed by the Company over the vesting period of the underlying
options. During 1998, no stock-based compensation was recorded as all options
granted to employees were issued at the estimated fair market value as of the
date of issuance. The Company recorded amortization of stock-based compensation
expense for options issued to employees of $459,534 and $444,532 for the years
ended December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively.
Income Taxes--Income taxes are provided for as required under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS
109. This Statement requires the use of the asset and liability method in
determining the tax effect on future years of the temporary differences
between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting
amounts.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments--Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments
SFAS 107, requires the disclosure of fair value information for certain
assets and liabilities, whether or not recorded in the balance sheets, for which
it is practical to estimate that value. The Company has the following financial
instruments: cash, receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and
certain long-term liabilities. Additionally, the Company had Redeemable Common
Stock at December 31, 1997 see Note 5. The Company considers the carrying
amount of these items, excluding the Redeemable Common Stock, to approximate
fair value.
Conversion of Preferred Stock--The accompanying financial statements
retroactively reflect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A, C, D
and E Preferred Stock Convertible Preferred Stock to Common Stock on a one for
one basis. The above conversion has been presented since the Company amended its
Certificate of Incorporation in December 1997 to provide that the Series A, C, D
and E Preferred Stock would be automatically converted into shares of Common
Stock upon the closing of a firm committment underwritten public offering of the
Common Stock. In March 1998, upon the closing of the Company initial public
offering, the foregoing conversion was completed.
Recently Enacted Pronouncements--The AICPA has issued Statement of Position
SOP 98-1, Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or Planned
for Internal Use. This SOP provides guidance on accounting for the costs of
computer software developed or obtained for internal use. This SOP requires
that the following costs be capitalized: 1 external direct costs of materials
and services incurred in developing or obtaining internal-use computer software;
2 payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated
with and devote time to the internal-use software project to the extent of time
spent directly on the project; and 3 interest costs. Computer software costs
that are research and development should be expensed as incurred. In addition,
training costs should be expensed as incurred. This statement is effective for
financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998,
however, earlier application is encouraged. The Company will adopt this
pronouncement in 1999 and has not yet determined the effect of SOP 98-1 on its
financial statements.
Use of Estimates--The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

3. Leases
Capital Leases
In April 1997, the Company signed a lease-financing commitment to receive
$4,000,000 to purchase equipment and expand its facilities. The lease commitment
provides for a payment term of 48 months per individual lease schedule. In
addition, the commitment provides for the issuance to the lessor of two warrants
the First Warrant and the Second Warrant to purchase shares of the Common
Stock. The First Warrant was issued in April 1997 and entitles the lessor to
purchase 11,111 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $900 per share.
The Second Warrant was issued in September 1997 when the Company aggregate
equipment cost under the agreement exceeded $2,000,000. The Second Warrant
entitles the lessor to purchase 10,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise
price of $1000 per share. The value ascribed to the warrants was $59,520. In
June 1998, the Company signed a lease-financing commitment to receive $5,000,000
to purchase various laboratory, office and computer equipment. The lease
commitment provides for payment terms of 60 months per individual lease
schedule.
The Company has also entered into other capital lease agreements to finance
the purchase of equipment. Leased equipment under all such agreements consisted
of the following                                  December 31,

$5,051,378 for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively.
These arrangements have terms of three to five years with interest rates ranging
from approximately 10% to 26%. At the end of the respective lease terms, the
Company has the right to either return the equipment to the lessor or purchase
the equipment at between $1 and 11% of the then fair market value of the
equipment.
The future minimum lease payments under capital lease obligations at December
31, 1998 were as follows

Operating Leases
In December 1996, the Company entered into a six-year lease agreement for
26,000 square feet to house its principal administrative and research facilities
at 555 Long Wharf Drive, New Haven, Connecticut. In October 1997 and August
1998, the Company amended that lease to increase its leased space to a total of
31,000 and 36,000 square feet, respectively. The Company may renew the lease
for two additional terms of five years each. In May 1998, the Company entered
into a lease agreement, expiring in May 2000, for its 32,000 square foot
research facility in Branford, Connecticut. The lease agreement may be renewed
for three additional terms of two years each. An additional 12,000 square feet
at the Company third research location in Alachua, Florida is also leased
under an agreement which may be renewed for an additional one year term, after
the expiration date in July 1999.
Total rent expense under all operating leases for 1996, 1997 and 1998 was
approximately $77,200, $487,300 and $1,016,050, respectively.
26
The future minimum rental payments for all operating leases are as follows as
of December 31, 1998 Year
$1,295,135
924,229
736,729
772,667
$3,728,760
4. Collaborations
Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc.
Effective June 1, 1997, the Company entered into a Collaborative Research and
License Agreement with Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. Pioneer Hi-Bred
whereby the Company is to perform research that will be funded by Pioneer Hi-
Bred. In conjunction with the execution of this agreement, Pioneer Hi-Bred made
an equity investment of $7,500,000 in the form of 1,000,000 shares of Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock see Note 5. In addition, Pioneer Hi-Bred paid the
Company $2,500,000 per year, for the first 10 months, in quarterly installments
due in advance, on or before the first day of each calendar quarter, with the
first payment prorated. In March of 1998, Pioneer Hi-Bred increased the minimum
annual research funding to $5,000,000 per year. Pioneer Hi-Bred has the right to
terminate the research program at any time upon a breach by the Company and on
three months' written notice at any time after May 2000.
The $5,000,000 per year fee is based upon an established number of CuraGen
employees whom will be devoted to the Pioneer Hi-Bred research. In accordance
with the Company revenue recognition policy as described in Note 1, revenue
has been recorded based upon work performed. For the years ended December 31,
1997 and 1998, the Company recorded revenue of $1,458,333 and $4,375,000, which
represented 25% and 47% of total revenue, respectively, related to this
agreement. In addition, $1,250,000 has been received from Pioneer Hi-Bred for
which the related services have not been performed and, therefore, such amount
is recorded as deferred revenue at December 31, 1998.
Genentech, Inc.
In June 1996, the Company entered into a Pilot Research Services and
Evaluation Agreement with Genentech, Inc. Genentech pursuant to which the
Company performed certain research services for a $200,000 fee. The pilot
collaboration was superseded by the Evaluation Agreement, signed and effective
December 27, 1996, pursuant to which the Company performed additional research
services during 1997 for a research fee of $667,000 payable in four equal
installments of $166,750. The Company completed the research within four months
of the receipt of tissue samples from Genentech as required by the Evaluation
Agreement and recorded $667,000 as revenue, which represented 11% of total
revenues for the year ended December 31, 1997. The entire accounts receivable
balance at December 31, 1997 was due from Genentech. In connection with the
execution of the Evaluation Agreement, Genentech made an equity investment of
$1,800,000 in the form of 307,167 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
see Note 5.
In November 1997, CuraGen and Genentech entered into a research collaboration
and database subscription arrangement to discover novel genes and therapeutics.
Pursuant to the agreement, Genentech purchased $5,000,000 of Common Stock in a
private placement concurrent with the initial public offering at the initial
public offering price. Genentech also agreed to provide CuraGen with an
interest-bearing loan facility which could in the aggregate reach $26,000,000 if
the research program continues beyond its initial three year term. The loan
facility contains annual borrowing limits and the outstanding principal and
interest under the loan facility are payable five years from the date of the
agreement. Subject to certain limitations, during the term of the agreement, and
after the end of the first year, the drawn-down portion of the loan is
convertible at CuraGen option into CuraGen non-voting Common Stock, par value
$01 per share the Non-Voting Common Stock based upon a formula that
approximates the prevailing market price of the Company Common Stock. If
issued, the Non-Voting Common Stock is convertible, at Genentech option, into
Common Stock i at any time, at Genentech option or ii upon the sale or
transfer of the Non-Voting Common Stock to a non-affiliated party. Genentech
will additionally provide funding of up to $24,000,000 over five years if the
database subscription arrangement is not terminated, the research collaboration
continues for the full five-year term and Genentech elects to retain licenses to
its discoveries. Genentech has an option to acquire licenses to certain
discoveries arising from the collaboration.
27
Biogen, Inc.
In October 1997, CuraGen and Biogen, Inc. Biogen entered into a research
collaboration and database subscription arrangement to discover novel genes and
therapeutics. Pursuant to the agreement, Biogen purchased $5,000,000 of Common
Stock in a private placement concurrent with the initial public offering at the
initial public offering price and agreed to provide a $10,000,000 interest-
bearing loan facility. At any time during the term of the agreement, the loan is
convertible at the Company option into Common Stock based upon a formula that
approximates its prevailing market price. Biogen will additionally provide
payments over five years to support a research collaboration to generate
project-specific GeneCallingR and PathCallingTM databases from Biogen-
specified disease systems and to gain non-exclusive access to the Company
GeneCalling and PathCalling subscription databases. Payments could reach
$18,500,000 if the research collaboration and database subscription arrangement
both continue for the full five-year term. Biogen has an option to acquire
exclusive licenses to certain discoveries arising from the collaboration.
For the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998, the Company recorded revenue
of $375,000 and $1,500,000 which represented 6% and 16% of total revenue related
to this agreement, respectively. In addition, $375,000 has been received from
Biogen for which the related services have not been performed and, therefore,
such amount is recorded as deferred revenue at December 31, 1998.
Glaxo Wellcome, Inc.
In November 1998, CuraGen and Glaxo Wellcome, Inc. Glaxo announced a drug
discovery collaboration to utilize CuraGen integrated genomics processes for
the study and selection of Glaxo compounds for clinical development. This
pharmacogenomics collaboration, up to five years in duration, is intended to
enable Glaxo to select drug candidates with the highest likelihood of success in
clinical trials. Specifically, CuraGen will evaluate numerous compounds across
Glaxo therapeutic programs, identifying gene responses associated with compound
efficacy and toxicity. For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company has
not recorded revenue related to this agreement. However, $2,750,000 has been
received from Glaxo for which the related services have not been performed and,
therefore, such amount is recorded as deferred revenue at December 31, 1998.
5. Stockholders' Equity
Authorized Capital Stock
The Company authorized capital stock consists of 50,000,000 shares of Common
Stock, par value of $01 per share Common Stock, 5,000,000 shares of
Preferred Stock, par value of $01 per share Preferred Stock and 3,000,000
shares of Non-Voting Common Stock.
At December 31, 1997, the Company had reserved 1,583,666 shares of Common
Stock pursuant to outstanding warrants, 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock for
issuance pursuant to the 1993 Stock Option and Incentive Award Plan the 1993
Stock Plan, 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance pursuant to the 1997
Employee, Director and Consultant Stock Plan the 1997 Stock Plan and 570,000
shares of Common Stock for issuance pursuant to non-qualified stock options. At
December 31, 1998, the Company had reserved 1,583,666 shares of Common Stock
pursuant to outstanding warrants, 871,883 shares of Common Stock for issuance
pursuant to the 1993 Stock Plan, 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance
pursuant to the 1997 Stock Plan and 453,750 shares of Common Stock for issuance
pursuant to non-qualified stock options. In November 1998, the Board of
Directors of the Company approved an amendment to and restatement of the 1997
Stock Plan to increase the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for
issuance of options granted pursuant to such Plan from 1,500,000 to 3,500,000,
and recommended that the holders of shares of the Corporation Common Stock
approve such amendment and restatement at the next Annual Meeting of the
Shareholders of the Company
Common Stock and Warrants to Purchase Common Stock
In February 1994, in connection with the $600,000 promissory note the CII
Note due to Connecticut Innovations, Inc. CII, the Company issued 102,156
shares of Common Stock to CII the CII Stock and a non-detachable stock
subscription warrant the CII Warrant to purchase 291,875 shares of Common
Stock the CII Warrant Shares at an aggregate exercise price equal to the
original principal balance of the CII Note $600,000 plus any unpaid interest.
The CII Stock was valued at $155,277. In April 1997, the CII Warrant was
exercised and CII received the CII Warrant Shares for consideration of
$1,485,644, which represented full payment of the CII Note totaling $600,000 in
principal and $885,644 in accrued interest. The Company had the right to
purchase the Call Right the CII Warrant Shares from CII. Further, CII had
the right to sell the Put Right the CII Warrant Shares to the Company.
28
In October 1997, the Company entered into an agreement with CII whereby, among
other things, the Call Right and Put Right were to be terminated upon the
closing of the initial public offering. In the absence of termination, the Call
Right would have been exercisable by the Company, i after June 30, 1996, for
the greater of a the fair market value of the CII Warrant Shares, or b
$600,000 plus a compounded annual rate of return of 30% from the date of the CII
Note, if certain levels of capital were raised, or ii after February 10, 1999,
for the greater of a the fair market value of the CII Warrant Shares, or b
$600,000 plus a compounded annual rate of return of 25% from the date of the CII
Note. In the absence of termination, the Put Right would have been exercisable
by CII i at any time until February 10, 2004, in the event that the Company
failed to maintain a Connecticut presence, for the greater of a the fair
market or book value of the CII Warrant Shares, or b $600,000 plus a
compounded annual rate of return of 40% from the date of the CII Note, or ii
at any time in the event that the Company violated certain covenants or a
default occurred under the CII documents, or at any time after February 10,
1999, for the greater of a the fair market value of the CII Warrant Shares, or
b $600,000 plus a compounded annual rate of return of 25% from the date of the
CII Note.
Given the Put Right, the Company had classified the CII Warrant Shares as
Redeemable Common Stock on the balance sheet at December 31, 1997. The carrying
value of the Redeemable Common Stock was adjusted through charges to additional
paid-in capital to amounts approximating the exercise price pursuant to the Put
Right. In March 1998, the Company completed its initial public offering.
Accordingly, the Put Right and the Call Right were terminated and the Redeemable
Common Stock was converted into Common Stock.
In March 1997, the Company also issued 17,073 and 22,673 shares of Common
Stock for a total value of $70,000 and $92,958, respectively, for the settlement
of outstanding accrued expense balances with two separate entities.
In March 1998, the Company completed its initial public offering of 3,000,000
shares of its Common Stock and received net proceeds of $30,200,000.
Concurrently with completion of the initial public offering, the Company
privately placed an aggregate of 956,520 shares of Common Stock and received net
proceeds of $5,000,000 each from Biogen and Genentech, two of the Company
collaborative partners and existing stockholders, and $1,000,000 from the
University of Florida Research Foundation, Inc. Accordingly, the combined net
proceeds raised by the Company from the offering and the concurrent private
placements were $41,200,000. In addition, in April 1998, the Company
underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 275,000 shares of
Common Stock at a price of $1150 per share to cover over-allotments, providing
CuraGen with additional net proceeds of $2,900,000.
Stock Options
The Company 1993 Stock Plan was adopted by the Company Board of Directors
and stockholders in December 1993 and subsequently amended by the Board of
Directors in May 1997. The 1993 Stock Plan provides for the issuance of stock
options and stock awards to officers, directors, advisors, employees, and
affiliates of the Company. Of the 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock which were
reserved for issuance under the 1993 Stock Plan, options to purchase 1,028,884
and 871,883 shares were granted and outstanding as of December 31, 1997 and
1998, respectively. The Company does not intend to grant any additional options
or awards under the 1993 Stock Plan.
A summary of all stock option activity under the 1993 Stock Plan during the
years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998 is as follows                                                  Weighted

The Company 1997 Stock Plan was approved by the Company Board of Directors
and stockholders in October 1997. The 1997 Stock Plan provides for the issuance
of stock options and stock grants Stock Rights to employees, directors and
consultants of the Company. A total of 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock have
been reserved for issuance under the 1997 Stock Plan. In November 1998, the
Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to and restatement of
the 1997 Stock Option Plan to increase the number of shares of Common Stock
reserved for issuance of options granted pursuant to such Plan from 1,500,000 to
3,500,000, and recommended that the holders of shares of the Corporation
Common Stock approve such amendment and restatement at the next Annual Meeting
of the Shareholders of the Company. The 1997 Stock Plan is administered by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee has
the authority to administer the provisions of the 1997 Stock Plan and to
determine the persons to whom Stock Rights will be granted, the number of shares
to be covered by each Stock Right and the terms and conditions upon which a
Stock Right may be granted. At December 31, 1997, the Company had 65,000
options outstanding under the 1997 Stock Plan and an additional 1,435,000
available for grant. At December 31, 1998, the Company had 1,276,100 options
outstanding under the 1997 Stock Plan and an additional 223,900 available for
grant. No stock options have been exercised under the 1997 Stock Plan as of
December 31, 1998.
A summary of all stock option activity under the 1997 Stock Plan during the
years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998 is as follows                                                Weighted

Had compensation cost for the Company stock option plans been determined in
accordance with the minimum value method as prescribed under SFAS 123, the
Company net loss attributable to common stockholders and net loss per share
attributable to common stockholders would have approximated the pro forma
amounts shown below for each of the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and
1998.

Net loss per share attributable to

The assumptions utilized by the Company in deriving the pro forma amounts for
the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997 are as follows: 1 0% dividend yield,
2 1% expected volatility, 3 risk-free interest rate of approximately 6%, and
4 expected life of the options of 10 years. The assumptions utilized by the
Company in deriving the pro forma amounts for the year ended December 31, 1998
are as follows: 1 0% dividend yield, 2 50% expected volatility, 3 risk-free
interest rate of approximately 525%, and 4 expected life of the options of 10
years. The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during the
years ended December 31, 1996, 1997, and 1998 was approximately $081 per share 614 per share and $577 per share, respectively.
Preferred Stock
The Company received aggregate consideration of $1,750,000 from five investors
as subscriptions for the purchase of 175,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock.
In September 1996, October 1996 and January 1997, the Company received proceeds
of $1,600,000, $50,000 and $100,000, respectively. The Series B Preferred Stock
was non-convertible and accrued dividends at the prime rate. Dividends were
payable when declared by the Board of Directors. Dividends in arrears at
December 31, 1997 were $181,563. Upon completing a qualified equity financing,
as defined in the Series B Preferred Stock Agreement, the Company was entitled
to redeem all of the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock. The completion of
the Company initial public offering satisfied such requirement, and
accordingly, in March 1998, the Company redeemed all of such Series B Preferred
Stock for an aggregate redemption price of $1,750,000, plus accrued dividends
and dividends in arrears.
In addition, holders of the Series B Preferred Stock received 5 year warrants
to purchase an aggregate of 358,361 shares of Common Stock at $586 per share,
which warrants expire on March 27, 2002. Such warrants were valued at $376,334.
The value of such warrants was accreted over the warrant period and such
accretion was classified as preferred dividends. For the years ended December
31, 1997 and 1998, such accretion amounted to $68,424 and $17,106, respectively.
In December 1996, in connection with the Genentech Evaluation Agreement see
Note 4, Genentech purchased 307,167 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for
$1,800,000, or $586 per share. In March 1997, the Company issued 2,011,468
shares of convertible Series C Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price
of $11,787,202. In addition, three year warrants were issued to certain
purchasers of the Series C Preferred Stock to purchase an aggregate of 366,894
shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $900 per share. Such warrants
were valued at $0 upon issuance. In May 1997, as a result of the Pioneer Hi-Bred
Agreement see Note 4, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $7,500,000. In
June 1997, the Company issued 100,000 shares of Series E Convertible Preferred
Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,000,001.
In March 1998, upon the closing of the initial public offering of its Common
Stock, the Company automatically converted the Series A, C, D and E Preferred
Stock into shares of Common Stock on a 1 for 1 basis.
6.Income Taxes
The net deferred income tax assets consisted of the following                                             December 31,
1997          1998
Total deferred income tax    $ 5,930,000       $ 15,400,000
Valuation    5,930,000       15,400,000
$     0       $     0
The deferred income tax assets are primarily a result of the federal and
Connecticut net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards
and timing differences relating to accrued payroll and depreciation and
amortization. As the Company has no prior earnings history, a valuation
allowance has been established due to the Company uncertainty in its ability
to benefit from the federal and Connecticut net operating loss carryforwards.
32
The change in the valuation allowance was $538,000, $4,068,000 and $9,470,000
for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively.
At December 31, 1998, the Company has federal and Connecticut net operating
loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately $27,400,000. Federal
net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2008, and Connecticut net
operating loss carryforwards began expiring in 1998. The Company also has
federal and Connecticut research and development tax credit carryforwards for
income tax purposes of approximately $1,600,000 and $2,700,000, respectively at
December 31, 1998.
7. Grants
The Company has received federal grants for specific purposes that are subject
to review and audit by the grantor agencies. Such audits could lead to requests
for reimbursement by the grantor agency for any expenditures disallowed under
the terms of the grant. Additionally, any noncompliance with the terms of the
grant could lead to loss of current or future awards.
During 1995, the Company received two grants from CII in the amounts of
$450,000 and $237,500. The term of the $450,000 grant is January 4, 1995 to
December 31, 2004, and the term of the $237,500 grant is February 1, 1995 to
January 31, 2005. The Company could be required to repay 100% of these amounts
if during the terms of the respective grants i the Company breaches and fails
to cure a material covenant, ii a material representation or warranty of the
Company becomes untrue and is not cured, iii the Company becomes bankrupt or
insolvent or liquidates its assets, or iv the Company is required to repay the
federal grants to which the CII grants relate. In addition, the Company could be
required to repay up to 200% of the amounts of the CII grants if the Company
ceases to have a Connecticut presence, during the terms of the respective
grants.
8. Related Parties
From inception of the Company through September 30, 1996, the Chief Executive
Officer elected to defer payment of his salary to future periods on an interest
free basis. This amount had been recorded as accrued payroll-related party as of
December 31, 1997. In May of 1998, payment in full of $308,125 was made to the
Chief Executive Officer.
In March 1997, the Company loaned one of its officers $50,000 with a term of 4
years. The note bore interest at 8% per annum and was automatically forgiven
upon consummation of the initial public offering in March 1998, as previously
defined in the agreement.
In September 1997, the Company loaned one of its officers $50,000 with a term
of 17 months bearing interest at 8% per annum. If this officer remains an
employee through the maturity date, the loan will be extended contingent upon
continued employment. This note will be forgiven if such officer remains an
employee through September 2001.
In February 1998, the Company loaned one of its officers $50,000 with a term
of 11 months bearing interest at 8% per annum. If this officer remains an
employee through the maturity date, the loan will be extended contingent upon
continued employment. This note will be forgiven if such officer remains an
employee through January 2002.
On December 23, 1998, the Company announced the departure of an Executive Vice
President and member of its Board of Directors. For the year ended December 31,
1998, in connection with the separation agreement signed by the parties, the
Company has recorded $928,561 of compensation related expenses, including
accrued bonuses for payments of accrued payroll and other compensation related
expenses. In addition, the Company and the former Executive Vice President and
director executed a non-qualified stock option agreement dated December 23, 1998
for the purchase of 25,000 shares of Common Stock at $6875 per share, the then
current fair market value of the Company Common Stock. The option will become
fully vested and exercisable on June 30, 2000 and shall terminate on June 30,
2002. The Company has recorded the related stock-based compensation expense in
1998, as described in Note 1. The Company has also agreed to make available
from time to time during the period from April 1, 1999 to March 31, 2001, a loan
in the maximum principal amount of $250,000. If utilized, the loan will have a
term of two years and will bear interest at a variable rate equal to the prime
rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal, adjusted monthly.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Board of Directors
of CuraGen Corporation
New Haven, Connecticut
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of CuraGen Corporation the
Company as of December 31, 1997 and 1998, and the related statements of
operations, changes in stockholders' equity deficiency and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31,
1997 and 1998, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP
