Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors
of School Specialty, Inc.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of School
Specialty, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation, and its subsidiaries as of April 28,
2001 and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders'
equity and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. The
financial statements of School Specialty, Inc. as of and for the two years
ended April 29, 2000, were audited by other auditors whose report dated June 9,
2000, expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of School Specialty, Inc. as
of April 28, 2001, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States.
Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements as of and for the year ended April 28, 2001, taken as a
whole. The schedule listed in Part IV
