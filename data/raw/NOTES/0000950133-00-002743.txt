REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
webMethods, Inc. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
the related consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders equity
deficitand cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of webMethods, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at March31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended March31, 2000 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above. s/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP McLean, Virginia May1, 2000, except for

WEBMETHODS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.Organization webMethods, Inc. the Company is a leading provider of
infrastructure software and services for achieving
business-to-business integration. The Companys products
enable companies to work more closely with their customers,
suppliers and other business partners through the real-time
exchange of information over the Internet and to complete
transactions electronically. The Company was incorporated in
Delaware on June12, 1996 and changed its name from
TransactNet, Inc. to webMethods, Inc. on January21, 1997.
During the fiscal year ended March31, 2000, the company
established wholly-owned subsidiaries: webMethods Germany GmbH,
webMethods B.V., and webMethods UK Limited. These subsidiaries
provide technical support, marketing and distribution support in
their geographic regions. The Companys operations are subject to certain risks and
uncertainties, including, among others, rapid technological
changes, success of the Companys product marketing and
product distribution strategies, the need to manage growth, the
need to retain key personnel and protect intellectual property,
and the availability of additional capital financing on terms
acceptable to the Company.
2.Summary of significant accounting policies
Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of webMethods, Inc. and all wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the period. Actual results could differ from these
estimates.
Fair value information The carrying amount of current assets and current liabilities
approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these
instruments. The carrying amount of the Companys line of
credit approximates market based on the floating interest rates.
Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Marketable securities The Companys marketable securities consist of corporate
bonds with maturities of less than two years. Securities are
classified as available for sale since management intends to hold
the securities for an indefinite period and may sell the
securities prior to their maturity. The marketable securities are
carried at aggregate fair value based generally on quoted market
prices. Gains and losses are determined based on the specific
identification method. Available for sale securities that are
reasonably expected by management to be sold within one year from
the balance sheet date are classified as current assets.
44 Table of Contents WEBMETHODS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued 2.Summary of significant accounting
policies Continued Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is
computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the related assets, ranging from three to five years.
Leased property or equipment meeting certain criteria is
capitalized and the present value of the related lease payments
is recorded as a liability. Amortization of capitalized leased
assets is computed on the straight-line method over the term of
the lease. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. At
the time of retirement or other disposal of property and
equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are
removed from their respective accounts and any resulting gain or
loss is included in operations.
Software development costs Software development costs are expensed as incurred until
technological feasibility has been established, at which time
such costs are capitalized until the product is available for
general release to customers. The Company defines the
establishment of technological feasibility as the completion of
all planning, designing, coding and testing activities that are
necessary to establish products that meet design specifications
including functions, features and technical performance
requirements. Under the Companys definition, establishing
technological feasibility is considered complete only after the
majority of customer testing and customer feedback has been
incorporated into product functionality. To date, the period
between technological feasibility and general availability has
been short, and thus all software development costs qualifying
for capitalization are insignificant.
Impairment of long-lived assets The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of its
long-lived assets. This evaluation consists of a comparison of
the carrying value of the assets with the assets expected
future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest costs.
Estimates of expected future cash flows represent
managements best estimate based on reasonable and
supportable assumptions and projections. If the expected future
cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, exceed the
carrying value of the asset, no impairment is recognized.
Impairment losses are measured as the difference between the
carrying value of long-lived assets and their fair value, based
on discounted future cash flows of the related asset.
Income taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences and
income tax credits. Temporary differences are primarily the
result of the differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their financial reporting amounts. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted statutory
tax rates applicable to the future years in which deferred tax
assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The
Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net
deferred tax asset as of March31, 2000 and 1999.
Foreign Currency Translations The functional currency for the Companys foreign
subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of the
Companys foreign operations are translated into U.S.
dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet
date; revenues and expenses are translated using the average
exchange rates in effect during the period. The cumulative
translation adjustments are included in accumulated other
45 Table of Contents WEBMETHODS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued 2.Summary of significant accounting
policies Continued comprehensive income or loss, which is a separate component of
stockholders equity deficit. Foreign currency transaction
gains or losses are included in the results of operations.
Revenue recognition Revenue from the sale of software licenses is recognized upon
shipment of product, provided that the fee is fixed and
determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and
collection of the resulting receivable is considered probable.
The Company does not offer exchanges of its products and
historically has not experienced significant returns. The Company
recognizes software license revenue over the term of the license
if the license requires delivery of unspecified products during
its term. Revenue related to customer support agreements is
deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the respective
agreements. When the Company provides a software license and the
related customer support arrangement for one bundled price, the
fair value of the customer support, based on the price charged
for that element separately, is deferred and recognized ratably
over the term of the respective agreement. If the license
agreement contains extended payment terms, revenue is recognized
as the payments become due, assuming that all other revenue
recognition criteria are met. Professional services revenue,
which includes training and consulting, is recognized at the time
the service is performed.
Stock-based compensation The Company measures compensation expense for its employee
stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method and
provides pro forma disclosures of net loss as if the fair value
method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. Under
the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock-based
compensation, when the exercise price of options granted to
employees is less than the fair value of the underlying stock on
the grant date, compensation expense is recognized over the
applicable vesting period.
Net loss per share Basic loss per share is computed based on the weighted average
number of outstanding shares of common stock. Diluted loss per
share adjusts the weighted average for the potential dilution
that could occur if stock options or warrants or convertible
securities were exercised or converted into common stock. Diluted
loss per share is the same as basic loss per share for all
periods presented because the effects of such items were
anti-dilutive given the Companys losses.
Segment reporting The Company operates as a single segment and will evaluate
additional segment disclosure requirements as it expands its
operations. See Note 15 for required geographic segment
information.
Recent accounting pronouncements In December1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission
SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No101,
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, which
provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure
of revenue in financial statements filed with the SEC.
Subsequently, the SEC released SAB 101A, which delayed the
implementation date of SAB 101 for registrants with fiscal years
that begin between December16, 1999 and March 15, 2000. The
Company is required to be in conformity with the provisions of
SAB 101, as amended by SAB 101A, no later than April1, 2000
and does not expect a material effect on the Companys
financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a
result of SAB 101.
46 Table of Contents WEBMETHODS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued 2.Summary of significant accounting
policies Continued In June1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued SFAS No137, which delays the
effective date of SFAS No133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which will
be effective for the Companys fiscal year 2001. This
statement establishes accounting and reporting standards
requiring that every derivative instrument, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, be recorded
in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at
its fair value. The statement also requires that changes in the
derivatives fair value be recognized in earnings unless
specific hedge accounting criteria are met. The Company has not
entered into derivative contracts and does not have near term
plans to enter into contracts, accordingly the adoption of SFAS
No133 and SFAS No137 is not expected to have a
material effect on the financial statements. In March2000, FASB issued Interpretation
FINNo44, Accounting for Certain Transactions
Involving Stock Compensation An Interpretation of APB
Opinion No25. FIN 44 clarifies the application of
APB Opinion No25 and, among other issues, clarifies the
following: the definition of an employee for purposes of applying
APB Opinion No25; the criteria for determining whether a
plan qualifies as a non-compensatory plan; the accounting
consequence of various modifications to the terms of previously
fixed stock options or awards; and the accounting for an exchange
of stock compensation awards in a business combination. FIN 44
is effective July1, 2000, but certain conclusions in FIN 44
cover specific events that occurred after either
December15, 1998 or January12, 2000. The Company does
not expect the application of FIN 44 to have a material impact
on its financial position or results of operations.
3.Related-party transactions An individual who is a director, corporate secretary and
stockholder of the Company is associated with a law firm that has
rendered various legal services for the Company. For the years
ended March31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, the Company has paid
the firm approximately $909,000, $178,000, and $64,000
respectively. As of March31, 2000 and 1999, the aggregate
amount due for these services was approximately $249,000 and
$137,000 respectively. For the year ended March31, 2000 the Company has entered
into certain contractual arrangements with several third parties
that invested in the Company through the purchase of
SeriesD and SeriesE mandatorily redeemable,
cumulative, convertible preferred stock see Note 12. Revenue
generated from these related parties was $6,100,000 for the year
ended March31, 2000. Accounts receivable from these related
parties as of March31, 2000 was $241,000. Additionally,
the Company paid $432,000 for services and equipment from related
parties for the year ended March31, 2000. Accounts payable
to these related parties was $113,000 as of March31, 2000.
4.Concentrations of credit risk Financial instruments which potentially expose the Company to
concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The
Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in bank accounts
which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company
has not experienced any losses on such accounts. Accounts
receivable consists principally of amounts due from large,
credit-worthy companies. The Company monitors the balances of
individual accounts to assess any collectibility issues. The
Company has not experienced significant losses related to
receivables in the past. For the year ended March31, 2000, one organization
individually accounted for approximately 22% of total revenue,
and one organization individually accounted for approximately 15%
of accounts receivable as

two organizations individually accounted for approximately 13%
and 10% of total revenue, and three organizations individually
accounted for approximately 33%, 22% and 11% of accounts
receivable as of March31, 1999. For the year ended
March31, 1998, four organizations individually accounted
for approximately 20%, 17%, 14% and 12% of total revenue.

the unrealized holding losses on marketable securities available
for sale, no other provisions for income taxes has been recorded
as the Company has incurred operating losses since its inception.

Continued 7.Income taxes Continued NOLs as of March31, 2000 and 1999 are approximately
$12,100,000 and $3,100,000 respectively, both of which begin to
expire in 2012. The realization of the benefits of the NOLs is
dependent on sufficient taxable income in future years. Lack of
future earnings, a change in the ownership of the Company, or the
application of the alternative minimum rules could adversely
affect the Companys ability to utilize the NOLs. Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax
purposes. The tax effect of each temporary difference as of
March31, 2000 and 1999 is as follows March 31 2000 1999 Net operating loss carryforwards 4,600,000 1,203,000 Accrued expenses 3,543,000 425,000 Deferred revenue 121,000 Accounts receivable 218,000 25,000 Property and equipment 4,000 4,000 Research and development credit 171,000 104,000 Stock Option Compensation 252,000 Other 10,000 Valuation allowance 8,798,000 1,882,000 Net Deferred Tax Assets Though management believes that future taxable income of the
Company may be sufficient to utilize a substantial amount of the
benefits of the Companys net operating loss carryforwards
and to realize its deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance has
been recorded to completely offset the carrying value of the
deferred tax assets as the realizability of the deferred tax
assets is not currently predictable. The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of taxes
determined by applying the U.S. Federal statutory rate to income

up to $500,000 for working capital purposes and equipment
advances. The Company was able to borrow under this agreement
through March31, 1999, and the unpaid principal balance as
of that date is payable in 36 equal monthly installments that
commenced shortly thereafter. As of March31, 2000 and 1999
the balance under this line was $153,054 and $247,275,
respectively. Interest is payable at the banks prime rate
plus 15% per annum. The line of credit is collateralized by
substantially all of the Companys assets. The related
agreement contains restrictive covenants which require the
Company to maintain, among other things, a
49 Table of Contents WEBMETHODS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued 8.Line of credit Continued ratio of quick assets to current liabilities, net of deferred
revenue, of at least 2 to 1. The Company was in compliance with
all covenants as of March31, 2000 and 1999. Of the total
line of credit amount, $200,000 has been designated for the
issuance of letters of credit relating to an office lease
agreement. On March31, 1999, $100,000 in letters of credit
were outstanding. The Company expects to repay all outstanding
balances under this loan agreement within one year from the
balance sheet date. In connection with this line of credit, the Company issued the
bank options to purchase 46,788 shares of the Companys
common stock at approximately $027 per share. The fair value of
these options was determined using the Black Scholes valuation
model and was insignificant to the overall financial statements. In December1999, the Company entered into a new revolving
promissory note with the same bank to borrow up to a maximum
principal amount of $3,000,000 with a maturity date of
December2, 2000. Borrowings under this note are limited to
a borrowing base equal to 75% of eligible accounts receivable.
Interest is payable on the unpaid principal balance at a rate of
the banks prime rate plus 1% per annum. This note is
collateralized by substantially all of the Companys assets.
The related agreement includes restrictive covenants which
require the Company to maintain, among other things, a ratio of
quick assets to current liabilities, less deferred revenue of at
least 15 to 10 and a quarterly revenue covenant such that total
revenue for each fiscal quarter must be equal to or greater than
total revenue for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. As
of March31, 2000, the Company had not borrowed against this
revolving promissory note. In connection with the revolving
promissory note, the Company obtained a letter of credit totaling
$750,000 related to a new office lease. The letter of credit
expires in June2001.
9.Lease commitments In August1999, the Company entered into an equipment line
of credit with a leasing company for the purchase of equipment
and software. Under this arrangement, the Company can enter into
leases for equipment and software for a period of one year from
the date of the arrangement. The interest rate under these leases
is fixed at the date of each individual lease, based on the 36
month treasury yield plus 547 basis points. Principal and
interest is payable under each lease in 36monthly
installments. At expiration of the lease term, the lessee will
have the option to purchase the equipment at fair market value
not to exceed 10% of the original cost. This arrangement includes
a restrictive covenant that requires the Company to maintain a
minimum of $2,500,000 of cash and marketable securities. The
Company was in compliance with this covenant as of March31,
2000. The Company leases office space in various locations under
operating leases expiring through fiscal 2002. Total rent expense
was approximately $803,000, $153,000, and $48,000 for the years
ended March31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. In
May1999, the Company entered into a lease for office space
in Virginia expiring in May31, 2001. In December1999,
the Company entered into a new five year lease agreement for
office space for the Companys new headquarters in Virginia.
The Company occupied the new facility in March 2000 and also
turned its previous premises over to a sublessee through the end

warrant to purchase 6,132 shares of the Companys common
stock at an exercise price of $108 per share to the landlord of
one of their leased facilities. The fair value of this warrant on
the grant date was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation
model and was insignificant to the overall financial statements.
10.Stockholders equity deficit The Company completed an initial public offering of 4,715,000 of
its $01 par value common stock, priced at $3500 per share on
February10, 2000 the IPO including 615,000 shares sold in
connection with the exercise of the underwriters
over-allotment. Concurrent with the IPO, the Company sold an
additional 518,058 shares of its common stock in a private
placement transaction at a price per share equal to $3378 the
IPO price less one-half of the underwriting discounts and
commissions. In preparation for the IPO, on October22,
1999, the board of directors and stockholders approved an
increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock from
20,000,000 shares to 200,000,000 shares. On February10,
2000 in connection with the IPO, the Company consummated a 1533
for one stock split. All references to the number of shares
authorized, issued and outstanding and per-share information for
all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the effects
of the stock split and share authorization. On October10, 1997, the Companys Board of Directors
approved a stock split in the form of a stock dividend at a rate
of an additional 79 shares of common stock for each share of
common stock outstanding as of October10, 1997. On
March5, 1998, the Board approved a stock split in the form
of a stock dividend at a rate of an additional 19 shares of
common stock for each share of common stock outstanding as of
March5, 1998. All share and per share data in these
financial statements have been retroactively restated to reflect
the March5, 1998 split and the October10, 1997 split.
11.Stock based compensation
Stock incentive plan On November1, 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Stock
Incentive Plan the Plan. The Plan is administered by a
Committee appointed by the Board of Directors, which has the
authority to determine which officers, directors and key
employees are awarded options pursuant to the Plan and to
determine the
51 Table of Contents WEBMETHODS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued 11.Stock based compensation
Continued terms and option exercise prices of the stock options. At
March31, 2000, the Company had reserved 10,731,000 shares
of the Companys common stock for issuance upon the exercise
of options granted under the Plan. At March31, 2000,
options to purchase 6,609,421 shares were outstanding and
1,725,114 shares were available for future grants. Qualified incentive stock options granted pursuant to the Plan
have an exercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying
common stock at the date of grant, vest at either the rate of
333% or 25% per year, beginning one year after the date of
award, and have a term of ten years. Prior to the Companys
initial public offering, the Board of Directors determined the
fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant
based on contemporaneous sales of the Companys preferred
stock for cash to third party investors. The following table summarizes the Companys activity for
all of its stock option awards Range of Weighted average Stock options exercise price Exercise price Outstanding March31, 1997 693,376 005 027 022 Granted 1,803,207 027 027 Exercised Forfeited 92,072 027 027 Outstanding March31, 1998 2,404,511 005 027 025 Granted 3,902,264 011 033 012 Exercised 383,220 011 027 016 Cancelled 2,062,376 005 027 025 Forfeited 176,201 011 027 013 Outstanding March31, 1999 3,684,978 011 033 012 Granted 5,207,495 217 3500 791 Exercised 2,013,245 011 606 020 Forfeited 269,807 011 605 246 Outstanding March31, 2000 6,609,421 0113500 614 Certain options granted during the year ended March31, 2000
resulted in deferred stock compensation as the estimated fair
value derived by reference to contemporaneous sales of
convertible preferred stock was greater than the exercise price
on the date of grant. The total deferred stock compensation
associated with these options was approximately
$111million. This amount is being amortized over the
respective vesting periods of these options, ranging from three
to four years. Approximately $1,767,000 was amortized during the
year ended March31, 2000. Included in the above table are options to purchase 46,788 shares
of the Companys common stock granted to the Companys
bank during the year ended March31, 1998 see Note 8 and
options to purchase an aggregate of 45,990 shares of the
Companys common stock granted to three non-employees during
the year ended March31, 2000. The options granted to
non-employees were granted in exchange for services provided.
Options to purchase 15,330 of these shares have an exercise price
of $217 per share and the options to purchase the remaining
30,660 shares have an exercise price of $288 per share. All of
these options granted to non-employees were fully exercisable and
non-forfeitable on September30, 1999. These options were
recorded at their aggregate fair value on September30, 1999
of $235,461 and amortized over the terms of the respective
consulting agreements. As of March31, 2000, they have been
fully amortized. The Company valued these options using the
Black-Scholes valuation model with the

Continued following assumptions: Risk-free interest rate of 550%; expected
life of 6years; no anticipated dividends; expected
volatility of 85%; and a fair market value of the underlying
common stock on the date of grant equal to the exercise price. Options to purchase 367,318, 909,284, and 193,546 shares of the
Companys common stock were exercisable at March31,
2000 and 1999, and 1998, respectively, at a weighted average
exercise price of $094, $015, and $020, per share,
respectively. Had compensation expense for the Plan been determined based on
the fair value of the related options at the grant dates,
consistent with SFAS No123, the Companys net loss

and 1998, respectively; expected volatility of 90%, 0% and 0% for
the years ended March31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively; expected life of 4years; and no anticipated
dividends. The weighted average fair value per share for stock option grants
that were awarded during the years ended March31, 2000,
1999 and 1998 was $397, $002, and $005, respectively.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan In January2000, the Board of Directors approved the

by and among the Company, Wolf Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware
corporation that is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and
Active Software, Inc., Active Software. Subject to

STATEMENTSContinued 17.Subsequent Events Continued the Company. Per the merger agreement, each issued and
outstanding share of Active Software common stock, will be
converted into 0527 fully paid and non-assessable shares of the
Companys common stock. All outstanding options to purchase
Active Software common stock, as well as the plans under which
the options were granted, will be assumed by the Company. The merger is intended to be treated as a tax-free reorganization
for federal income tax purposes and to be accounted for using
