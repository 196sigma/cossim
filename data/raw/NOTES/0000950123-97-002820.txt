INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Steel Dynamics, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Steel
Dynamics, Inc. the Company as of December 31, 1995 and 1996, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Steel Dynamics, Inc. as of
December 31, 1995 and 1996, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. S/ Deloitte & Touche LLP DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and Iron Dynamics, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company operated on a four
week, four week, five week accounting cycle for 1996. Accordingly, the Company
interim periods ended on the last day of the fourth or fifth week within the
month. The Company, effective January 1997, operates on a calendar month
accounting cycle.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The Company records sales upon shipment and provides an allowance for estimated
costs associated with returns.
Business
The Company, formed on September 7, 1993, operates in one industry segment and
operates a thin-slab cast steel mini-mill in the Midwest, with the capacity to
produce 14 million tons annually of hot-rolled steel coils. The Company
products are sold primarily to the automotive, tubing, construction and
commercial equipment industries.
Cash
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Restricted cash consists
of cash held by a trustee in a debt service fund for the repayment of principal
and interest on the Company municipal bond.
Inventories
Inventories consist of approximately 97% and 91% of raw materials and supplies,
and 3% and 9% of finished products as of December 31, 1995 and 1996,
respectively. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out
method or market.
Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition which includes
capitalized interest on construction-in-progress of $101 million and $10
million in 1995 and 1996, respectively. Depreciation is provided using the
units-of-production method for manufacturing plant and equipment and using the
straight-line method for non-manufacturing equipment over the estimated useful
lives of the assets ranging from 12 years to 30 years. Repairs and maintenance
are expensed as incurred. The Company recorded proceeds received from state and
local government grants and other capital cost reimbursements as reductions of
the related capital assets. Grants and reimbursements recorded as reductions of
the related capital cost, net of accumulated depreciation, totaled $240 million
as of December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of,
among other things, requires entities to review long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value
may not be recoverable. Adoption of this standard had no effect on the Company
financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 1996.
Debt Issuance Costs
The costs related to the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized to interest
expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the related debt.                    21

STEEL DYNAMICS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based on differences between
the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using
enacted income tax rates. Deferred income tax expense or benefit is based on the
change in deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period, subject to
an ongoing assessment of realization of deferred tax assets.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, short-term
investments and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash with high
quality financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure from any
one institution. Generally, the Company does not require collateral or other
security to support customer receivables.
Foreign Currency Transactions
Transaction gains and losses incurred by the Company for equipment purchases
denominated in a foreign currency are recorded in results of operations
currently.
Net Loss Per Share
Net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1995 were
calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding including the anti-dilutive effect of shares issued
from September 23, 1995 through September 23, 1996 using the treasury stock
method. Net loss per share for the year ended December 31, 1996 excludes the
anti-dilutive effect of common stock equivalents. 2. PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT in thousands                            1995    1996

Long-term      $220,996       $196,168
The Company entered into a credit agreement, as amended, with a syndicate bank
group, on June 30, 1994. Subject to the terms and conditions of the credit
agreement, borrowings of $150 million under senior secured notes were used to
fund the construction of the steel mini-mill, $1500 million was designated and
remains available at December 31, 1996 for construction of the cold mill, and
$45 million of revolving credit is available for working capital purposes. At
December 31, 1995 and 1996 there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving
credit facility. The senior secured notes and revolving credit facility are
collateralized by substantially all assets of the Company other than certain
property, plant, and equipment securing the electric utility loan. The Company
is required to pay a commitment fee equal to a percentage ranging from 0125% to
050% annually depending upon the principal amount of the unused borrowing
capacity under the senior secured notes and the unused revolving credit
facility.
In 1995 the Company borrowed $214 million through a state government municipal
bond program, of which $27 million and $28 million as of December 31, 1995 and
1996, respectively, is held by a trustee in a debt service reserve fund and is
recorded as restricted cash. At December 31, 1996, a stand-by letter of credit
of $220 million relating to the municipal bonds was outstanding.
The electric utility transmission facility loan of $78 million and $77 million
at December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively, represents the Company portion of
the cost of the transmission facilities constructed by the utility to service
the Company site. The corresponding cost is included in other assets and is
being amortized over twenty years on the straight-line basis.
The electric utility loan of $130 million and $131 million at December 31,
1995 and 1996, respectively, represents the Company portion of the cost of the
Company substation constructed on-site. Interest and principal payments are
made equally on a monthly basis in an amount necessary to repay the loan fifteen
years from the date of commencement of operations.
The credit agreement, electric utility loan and transmission facility loan
require the Company to maintain certain covenants, the most restrictive of which
are requirements to maintain tangible net worth of at least $45 million plus 50%
of cumulative net income, a minimum current ratio, a maximum leverage ratio and
a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The credit agreement also limits
indebtedness of the Company and the amount of capital expenditures and prohibits
the payment of dividends.
The other equipment obligation represents deferred payments for the purchase of
certain equipment. The obligation is non-interest bearing and was discounted at
7% over a term of five years.                    23

STEEL DYNAMICS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company in June 1994 entered into an agreement with respect to senior
subordinated promissory notes Subordinated Notes in the aggregate principal
amount of $55 million and warrants to purchase up to 1,641,827 shares of Class A
common stock warrants for the purchase of 29,851 shares per $1 million of
Subordinated Notes at an exercise price which was less than $001 per share.
The proceeds received from the issuance of the Subordinated Notes and warrants
were allocated to the Subordinated Notes and warrants based upon their estimated
fair values. The Subordinated Notes were repaid in November 1996 with a portion
of the proceeds from the initial public offering. An extraordinary loss on the
prepayment of the Subordinated Notes in the amount of $73 million was recorded
in 1996 and was comprised of the write-off of the unamortized discount,
write-off of the financing costs associated with the Subordinated Notes and a
prepayment penalty.
If the retirement of the Subordinated Notes had occurred on January 1, 1996,
income per share before extraordinary loss would have been $11, the per share
effect of extraordinary loss would have been $24 and the net loss per share
would have been $13.

4. INCOME TAXES
The effective income tax rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate
for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996 because of the valuation
allowances recorded.     The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows

carryforwards of approximately $494 million for federal income tax purposes.
The carryforwards expire $2 million in 2009, $23 million in 2010 and $469
million in 2011. Because of the Company limited operating history, a valuation
allowance for net deferred tax assets has been provided.                    24

STEEL DYNAMICS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for the plans. No
compensation cost has been recognized for the plans because the stock option
price is equal to fair value at the grant date. Had compensation cost for the
plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards
under the plan consistent with the fair value method of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company net loss and net loss
per share would have increased to the pro forma amounts indicated below in
thousands, except per share data                          Years ended December 31,

The fair value of the option grants are estimated on the date of grant using an
option pricing model with the following assumptions: no dividend yield,
risk-free interest rates of 57% to 71%, expected volatility of 30% and
expected lives of one and one-half to eight years. The pro forma amounts are not
representative of the effects on reported net income for future years.
