Item8:
Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data Report of Independent Auditors To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Waters Corporation In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of
operations, of stockholders equity and comprehensive
income, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Waters Corporation and its
subsidiaries at December31, 2003 and 2002, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December31, 2003, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the accompanying
financial statement schedule presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. As discussed in Note2 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting for patent related costs in 2002. Also discussed in
Note2 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill to conform
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in 2002.

Description of Business, Organization and
Basis of Presentation Waters Corporation Waters or the
Company, an analytical instrument manufacturer,
manufactures and distributes, through its Waters Division, high
performance liquid chromatography HPLC
instruments, chromatography columns and other consumables, and
related service, as well as mass spectrometry MS
instruments, which are complementary products that can be
integrated and used along with other analytical instruments,
especially HPLC. HPLC, the largest product segment of the
analytical instrument market, is utilized in a broad range of
industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the
chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and
to purify a full range of compounds. MS instruments are used in
drug discovery and development, including clinical trial
testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes known as
proteomics and environmental testing. Through its
TA Instruments Division TAI, the Company designs,
manufactures and sells thermal analysis and rheology instruments
which are used in predicting the suitability of polymers and
viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and
health care products. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2003,
the Company completed the integration of the HPLC and MS
worldwide sales, service and support organizations. Accordingly,
the Micromass operating segment Micromass has been
integrated into the Waters operating segment. As discussed in
Note20 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company has two operating segments, Waters Division and TAI,
which have been aggregated into one reporting segment for
financial statement purposes.

Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial
statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
liabilities. On an on-going basis, Waters evaluates its
estimates, including those related to revenue recognition,
product returns and allowances, bad debts, inventory valuation,
equity investments, goodwill and intangible assets, income
taxes, warranty and installation provisions, contingencies and
litigation. Waters bases its estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions. Risks and Uncertainties The Company is subject to risks common to
companies in the analytical instrument industry, including, but
not limited to, development by the Company or its competitors of
new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel,
protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with
regulations of the U.S.Food and Drug Administration and
similar foreign regulatory authorities and agencies. Reclassification Certain amounts from prior years have been
reclassified in the accompanying financial statements in order
to be consistent with the current years classifications.
In particular, the Company reclassified field service expenses
associated with service revenues from selling, general and
administrative expenses to cost of sales in 2002. For the years
ended December31, 2002 and 2001 the amount of costs
reclassified to cost of sales were $584million and
$507million, respectively, and the gross profit as a
percentage of sales decreased 66% and 59%, for each period.
This change was primarily a result of the integration of the
Companys HPLC and MS worldwide sales, service and support
organizations and to align the Companys reporting with the
majority of other companies in the same industry. In the first
quarter of 2003, the Company reclassified all MS and thermal
analysis demonstration demo inventory from
property, plant and equipment, net, to inventories. 35 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued At December31, 2002 the amount of demo
inventory reclassified to inventories was $187million.
The primary reason for this change was to consistently classify
demo inventory across product lines. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, most of which are
wholly owned. The Company consolidates entities in which it owns
or controls fifty percent or more of the voting shares. All
material intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated. Translation of Foreign Currencies For most of the Companys foreign
operations, assets and liabilities are translated into
U.S.dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance
sheet date while revenues and expenses are translated at average
exchange rates prevailing during the period. Any resulting
translation gains or losses are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets.
The Companys net sales derived from operations outside the
United States were 55% in 2003, 62% in 2002 and 57% in 2001.
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included
in net income in the consolidated statements of operations and
were not material for the years presented. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents primarily represent highly
liquid investments, with original maturities of 90days or
less, in repurchase agreements and money market funds which are
convertible to a known amount of cash and carry an insignificant
risk of change in value. The Company has periodically maintained
balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally
insured limits. Restricted Cash At December31, 2002, restricted cash was
$499million, which represented credit support for a
standby letter of credit issued securing damages awarded plus
interest with respect to the Applera patent litigation
Note12. In April 2003, the Company made a payment of
$537million for damages and interest relating to this
patent litigation and, as a result, the Company is no longer
required to maintain a restricted cash balance. Concentration of Credit Risk The Company sells its products and services to a
significant number of large and small customers throughout the
world, with net sales to the pharmaceutical industry of
approximately 53% in 2003, 57% in 2002 and 63% in 2001. None of
the Companys individual customers accounted for more than
3% of annual Company sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001. The Company
performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers and
generally does not require collateral, but in certain
circumstances may require letters of credit or deposits.
Historically, the Company has not experienced significant bad
debt losses. Inventory The Company values all of its inventories at the
lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis
FIFO. Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized for
temporary differences between financial statement and income tax
basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for
the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A
valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax
assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely
than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. 36 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is recorded at
cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
expense while the costs of significant improvements are
capitalized. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line
method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings and
improvements thirty years, leasehold
improvements the shorter of fifteen years or life of
lease, and production and other equipment three to
ten years. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of the assets
disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are
eliminated from the balance sheet and related gains or losses
are reflected in the statement of operations. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Effective January1, 2002, the Company
adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets and no longer amortizes goodwill. Under the
transition provisions of SFAS142, there was no goodwill
impairment at January1, 2002. The Company tests for
goodwill impairment using a fair value approach at the reporting
unit level annually, or earlier if an event occurs or
circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the
fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
Additionally, the Company has elected to make January 1 the
annual impairment assessment date for all reporting units.
SFAS142 defines a reporting unit as an operating segment,
or one level below an operating segment, if discrete financial
information is prepared and reviewed by management. Goodwill is
allocated to the reporting units at the time of acquisition.
Under the impairment test, if a reporting units carrying
amount exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill impairment is
recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill
exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. The fair value
of reporting units were estimated using a discounted cash flows
technique which includes certain management assumptions such as
estimated future cash flows, estimated growth rates and discount
rates. During fiscal year 2001, goodwill was amortized on a
straight-line basis. For the year ended December31, 2001 the
Companys goodwill amortization expense was approximately
$40million. Goodwill amortization expense per basic
common share and per diluted common share for the year ended
December31, 2001 would have been $003. Pro forma net
income for the year ended December31, 2001 would have been
$1176million, excluding goodwill amortization expense at
the Companys effective tax rate of 24%. Reported net
income for the year ended December31, 2001 was
$1145million. Pro forma net income per basic common share
and pro forma net income per diluted common share for the year
ended December31, 2001 would have been $090 and $085,
respectively. Reported net income per basic common share and net
income per diluted common share for the year ended
December31, 2001 was $088 and $083, respectively. The Companys intangible assets include
purchased technology, capitalized software development costs, as
discussed below, costs associated with acquiring Company
patents, trademarks and intellectual properties, such as
licenses, and debt issuance costs. Purchased intangibles are
recorded at their fair market values as of the acquisition date
and amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from two
to fifteen years. Other intangibles are amortized over a period
ranging from three to fifteen years. Debt issuance costs are
amortized over the life of the related debt using the effective
interest method. Software Development Costs The Company capitalizes software development
costs for products offered for sale in accordance with
SFAS86. Capitalized costs are amortized to cost of sales
over the period of economic benefit, which approximates a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
related software products, generally three to five years. The Company capitalizes internal software
development costs in accordance with Statement of Position
SOP98-1, Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.
Capitalized internal software development costs are amortized
over the period of economic benefit which 37 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued approximates a straight-line basis over ten
years. For the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002,
capitalized internal software included in property, plant and
equipment totaled $17million and $21million net of
accumulated amortization of $21million and
$17million respectively. Change in Accounting for Patent Related
Costs In the second quarter of 2002, the Company
changed its method of accounting for legal costs associated with
litigating patents effective January1, 2002. Prior to the
change, the Company capitalized these patent costs and amortized
them over the estimated remaining economic life of the patent.
Under the new method, these costs are expensed as incurred. The
Company believes that this change is preferable because it will
provide a better comparison with the Companys industry
peers, the majority of which expense these costs as incurred.
The $45million cumulative effect of the change on prior
years after reduction for income taxes of $13million is
included as a charge to net income as of January1, 2002.
The effect of the change for the year ended December31,
2002 was to decrease income before cumulative effect of change
in accounting principle approximately $28million or
$002per diluted share and net income $73million or
$005per diluted share. Pro forma net income for the year ended
December31, 2001 would have been $1125million had
the change in accounting for patent related costs occurred at
the beginning of 2001. Reported net income for the year ended
December31, 2001 was $1145million. Pro forma net
income per basic common share and pro forma net income per
diluted common share for the year ended December31, 2001
would have been $086 and $082, respectively. Reported net
income per basic common share and net income per diluted common
share for the year ended December31, 2001 was $088 and
$083, respectively. The pro forma amounts reflect the effect of
retroactive application of this change had the new method been
in effect for all periods presented. Investments The Company accounts for its investments that
represent less than twenty percent ownership using
SFAS115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities. This standard requires that certain
debt and equity securities be adjusted to market value at the
end of each accounting period. Unrealized market gains and
losses are charged to earnings if the securities are traded for
short-term profit. Otherwise, these securities are considered
available-for-sale investments and unrealized gains and losses
are charged or credited to other comprehensive income loss in
stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses on sales of
investments are included in the consolidated statements of
operations. Investments for which the Company does not have
the ability to exercise significant influence and for which
there is not a readily determinable market value are accounted
for under the cost method of accounting. The Company
periodically evaluates the carrying value of its investments
accounted for under the cost method of accounting and carries
them at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. For
investments in which the Company owns or controls between twenty
and forty-nine percent of the voting shares, or over which it
exerts significant influence over operating and financial
policies, the equity method of accounting is used. The
Companys share of net income or losses of equity
investments is included in the consolidated statements of
operations and was not material in any period presented. All
investments at December31, 2003 and 2002 are included in
other assets. Asset Impairments The Company reviews its long-lived assets for
impairment in accordance with SFAS144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.
Whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates
the fair value of the asset, relying on a number of factors
including but not limited to operating results, business plans,
economic projections and anticipated future cash flows. Any
change in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of the
Companys evaluation is separately identified in the
consolidated statements of operations. 38 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Stockholders Equity On August9, 2002, the Board of Directors
approved the adoption of a stock purchase rights plan where a
dividend of one fractional preferred share purchase right a
Right was declared for each outstanding share of
common stock, par value $001per share, of the Company.
The dividend was paid on August27, 2002 to the
stockholders of record on that date. The Rights, which expire on
August27, 2012, become exercisable only under certain
conditions. When they first become exercisable, each Right will
entitle its holder to buy from Waters one one-hundredth of a
share of new SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock
authorized limit of 4,000 for $12000. When a person or group
actually has acquired 15% or more of Waters common stock,
the Rights will then become exercisable for a number of shares
of Waters common stock with a market value of twice the
exercise price $12000 of each Right. In addition, the Rights
will then become exercisable for a number of shares of common
stock of the acquiring company with a market value of twice the
exercise price per Right. The Board of Directors may redeem the
Rights at a price of $0001per Right up until 10days
following a public announcement that any person or group has
acquired 15% or more of the Companys common stock. On June25, 2002, the Board of Directors
authorized the Company to repurchase up to $200million of
its outstanding common shares over a one-year period. During the
years ended December31, 2003 and 2002, the Company
purchased 4,399shares of its common stock for
$1006million and 4,078shares of its common stock
for $993million, respectively. The total shares purchased
under this program were 8,477 thus completing its
$2000million stock buyback program. On May6, 2003, the Companys Board of
Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to
$400million of its outstanding common shares over a
two-year period. During the year ended December31, 2003,
the Company purchased 7,540shares of its common stock for
$2240million. At December31, 2003, the Company had
borrowings outstanding under its credit facility of
$2365million principally to finance share repurchases. In the aggregate, the Company has repurchased
11,939shares of its common stock for $3246million
during the year ended December31, 2003. The Companys
share repurchase program is beneficial to shareholders by
increasing earnings per share via reducing the outstanding
number of shares through open market purchases. Hedge Transactions The Company records its hedge transactions in
accordance with SFAS133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, which
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded
in other contracts, and for hedging activities. All derivatives,
whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required
to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as either
assets or liabilities. If the derivative is designated as a fair
value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and
of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are
recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a
cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair
value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive
income OCI and are recognized in earnings when the
hedged item affects earnings; ineffective portions of changes in
fair value are recognized in earnings. The Company currently uses derivative instruments
to manage exposures to foreign currency risks. The
Companys objectives for holding derivatives are to
minimize foreign currency risk using the most effective methods
to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign currency exposure.
The Company documents all relationships between hedging
instruments and hedged items, and links all derivatives
designated as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges to
specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to
specific forecasted transactions. The Company also assesses and
documents, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing
basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging
transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair
values or cash flows associated with the hedged items. 39 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The Company has operations in various countries
and currencies throughout the world. As a result, the
Companys financial position, results of operations and
cash flows are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates. The Company uses debt swap agreements and
forward foreign exchange contracts to partially mitigate such
effects, and these agreements are designated as foreign currency
hedges of a net investment in foreign operations. The debt swap
agreements effectively swap higher U.S.dollar variable
rate borrowings for lower variable rate borrowings denominated
in the respective currencies. During 2003 and 2002, the Company
opened and subsequently closed debt swap agreements in Japanese
yen. In December 2003, the Company entered into new debt swap
agreements in Japanese yen with notional amounts totaling
$250million, with terms of three months and an interest
rate of 006%. For the year ended December31, 2003, the
Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax gains of
$16million in OCI, which consisted of realized gains of
$13million relating to the closed debt swap agreements
and unrealized gains of $03million relating to the
Japanese yen swap agreements, both of which partially offset
hedged foreign exchange impacts. At December31, 2002, the
Company held debt swap agreements in Japanese yen with notional
amounts totaling $250million, with terms of three months
and an interest rate of 007%. For the year ended
December31, 2002, the Company recorded cumulative net
pre-tax gains of $10million in OCI, which consisted of
realized losses of $14million and unrealized gains of
$04million. At December31, 2001, the Company held
debt swap agreements in Japanese yen with notional amounts
totaling $270million, with terms of three months and an
interest rate of 015%. For the year ended December31,
2001, the Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax gains of
$78million in OCI, which consisted of realized gains of
$68million and unrealized gains of $10million. In
December 2002, the Company opened forward foreign exchange
contracts in British pounds with notional amounts totaling
$400million and terms of forty-five days. For the years
ended December31, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded
realized losses of $33million and unrealized gains of
$03million, respectively, in OCI relating to these
forward foreign exchange contracts. The Company also enters into forward foreign
exchange contracts, not designated as cash flow hedging
instruments under SFAS133, principally to hedge the impact
of currency fluctuations on certain intercompany balances.
Principal hedged currencies include the euro and British pound.
The periods of these forward contracts typically range from one
to three months and have varying notional amounts which are
intended to be consistent with changes in intercompany balances.
Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in
selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated
statements of operations. Foreign currency gains and losses from
currency fluctuations on intercompany balances and these forward
contracts were $34million in 2003 and not material for
2002 and 2001. At December31, 2003 and December31,
2002, the Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with
notional amounts totaling approximately $320million and
$690million, respectively. Revenue Recognition Sales of products and services are generally
recorded based on product shipment and performance of service,
respectively. Product shipments, including those for
demonstration or evaluation, and service contracts are not
recorded as revenues until a valid purchase order or master
agreement is received specifying fixed terms and prices.
Proceeds received in advance of product shipment or performance
of service are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated
balance sheets. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost
of sales net of amounts invoiced to the customer per the order. The Companys method of revenue recognition
for certain products requiring installation is in accordance
with Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB 104,
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.
Accordingly, the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the
fair value of the installation service is deferred when the
product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple
element arrangement when installation is complete. The Company
determines the fair value of installation based on several
factors, including hourly service, billing rates, installation
hours and amounts charged by third parties. The Company recognizes product revenue when legal
title has transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer.
The Company generally structures its sales arrangements as FOB
shipping point or international 40 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued equivalent and accordingly, recognizes revenue
upon shipment. In some cases, FOB destination based shipping
terms are included in sales arrangements in which cases revenue
is recognized when the products arrive at the customer site. Returns and customer credits are infrequent and
recorded as a reduction to sales. Rights of return are generally
not included in sales arrangements. Revenue associated with
products that contain specific customer acceptance criteria is
not recognized before the customer acceptance criteria is
satisfied. Discounts from list prices are recorded as a
reduction to sales. Nearly all of the Companys instruments
contain embedded operating system and data management software,
which is included in the purchase price. Software is also sold
separately and revenue is recognized upon shipment under the
provisions of SOP97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, as no significant post-delivery obligations
remain. Software upgrades are typically sold as part of a
service contract with revenue recognized ratably over the term
of the service contract. The Company assists customers in obtaining
financing with an independent third-party leasing company with
respect to certain product sales. Revenue is generally
recognized upon product shipment under these arrangements. The
Company receives payment from the leasing company shortly after
shipment, provided delivery and credit documentation meets
contractual criteria. The customer is obligated to pay the
leasing company but Waters retains some credit risk if the
customer is unable to pay. Accordingly, the Company reduces
revenue equal to pre-established loss-pool criteria, including
contracts with recourse. Waters credit risk is significantly
reduced through loss-pool limitations and re-marketing rights in
the event of a default. Product Warranty Costs The Company accrues estimated product warranty
costs at the time of sale which are included in cost of sales in
the consolidated statements of operations. While the Company
engages in extensive product quality programs and processes,
including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its
component supplies, the Company warranty obligation is affected
by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery
costs incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of
the accrued warranty liability is based on historical
information such as past experience, product failure rates,
number of units repaired and estimated cost of material and
labor. The liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least
quarterly. The following is a rollforward of the
Companys accrued warranty liability for the year ended

and included in selling, general and administrative expenses in
the consolidated statements of operations. Advertising expenses
for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $96million 83million and $76million, respectively. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses are comprised
of costs incurred in performing research and development
activities including salaries and benefits, facilities costs,
overhead costs, contract services and other outside costs.
Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. 41 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Expensed In-Process Research and Developments
Expenses Costs to acquire in-process research and
development IPRD projects and technologies,
which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of
acquisition and have no alternative future use, are expensed as
incurred see Note7. Stock-Based Compensation The Company has five stock-based compensation
plans, which are described in Note16. The Company uses the
intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees, and related interpretations, including
Interpretation 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions
Involving Stock Compensation, for its plans. Accordingly,
no compensation expense has been recognized for its fixed
employee stock option plans and its employee stock purchase plan
since all stock based compensation awards are granted at the
current fair value of the Companys common stock as of the
date of the award. The following table illustrates the effect on net

Income Per Share In accordance with SFAS128, Earnings
Per Share, the Company presents two earnings per share
EPS amounts. Income per basic common share is
based on income available to common shareholders and the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
periods presented. Income per diluted common share includes
additional dilution from potential common stock, such as stock
issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options outstanding. 42 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Comprehensive Income The Company accounts for comprehensive income in
accordance with SFAS130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income. The statement establishes standards for reporting
and displaying comprehensive income and its components in a full
set of general-purpose financial statements. The statement
requires that all components of comprehensive income be reported
in a financial statement that is displayed with the same
prominence as other financial statements. Recent Accounting Standards Changes In December 2003, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued revised FASB Statement
No132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions
and Other Postretirement Benefits. The revised standard
provides additional required disclosures for pensions and other
postretirement benefit plans and is designed to improve
disclosure transparency in financial statements. The revised
standard replaces existing pension disclosure requirements. The
revised SFAS132 is effective, with some exceptions, for
fiscal years ending after December15, 2003. It does not
change the measurement or recognition of those plans. In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin SAB No104, Revenue
Recognition, which supersedes SAB No101,
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB
No104 rescinds accounting guidance in SAB No101
related to multiple-element arrangements as this guidance has
been superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF00-21,
Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables. The adoption of SAB No104 did not
have a material impact on our financial position or results of
operations. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretations FIN No46
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
interpretation of ARB 51. FIN No46 provides
guidance on the identification of entities for which control is
achieved through means other than through voting rights called
variable interest entities or VIEs and
how to determine when and which business enterprise should
consolidate the VIE the primary beneficiary. This
new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either
1the equity investors if any do not have a controlling
financial interest or 2the equity investment at risk is
insufficient to finance that entitys activities without
receiving additional subordinated financial support from other
parties. In addition, FIN No46 requires that both the
primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant
variable interest in a VIE make additional disclosures. The
adoption of FIN No46 did not have a material impact on
our financial position or results of operations. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to
FIN46 FIN46R to address various
technical corrections and implementation issues that have arisen
since its issuance. The provisions of FIN46R are effective
for financial periods ending after March15, 2004, thus the
Company will implement the new provisions effective
March31, 2004. As FIN46R was recently issued and
contains provisions that the accounting profession continues to
analyze, the Companys assessment of the impact of
FIN46R on all VIEs with which it is involved is ongoing.
However, at this time and based on managements current
interpretation, the Company does not believe that the
implementation of FIN46R will have a material impact on
the Companys Consolidated financial statements, earnings
or capital resources. In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued SFASNo150,
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.
SFAS150 established standards for how to classify and
measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of
both liabilities and equity. The provisions of SFAS150
were effective for financial instruments entered into or
modified after May31, 2003. The application of
SFAS150 did not have a material impact on the
Companys financial position, results of operations, or
cash flows. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS149,
Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities. SFAS149 amends and clarifies
financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts and for hedging activities 43 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued under SFAS133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The changes
in SFAS149 improve financial reporting by requiring that
contracts with similar characteristics be accounted for
similarly. SFAS149 is effective, with some exceptions, for
contracts entered into or modified after June30, 2003. The
application of SFAS149 did not have a material impact on
the Companys financial position, results of operations, or
cash flows. In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue00-21,
Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables. EITF Issue 00-21 provides guidance on how to
determine when an arrangement that involves multiple
revenue-generating activities or deliverables should be divided
into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition
purposes, and if this division is required, how the arrangement
consideration should be allocated among the separate units of
accounting. The guidance in the consensus is effective for
revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning
after June15, 2003. The adoption of EITF Issue 00-21 did
not have a material effect on the Companys financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows. 3Inventories Inventories are classified as follows in

5Business
Investments In November 2000 and February 2002, the Company
made minority equity investments in
GeneProtTM,Inc. GeneProt, a
privately held company, of $36million and
$100million, respectively. The investment in GeneProt is
accounted for under the cost method of accounting. To the
Companys knowledge, due to changes in GeneProts
ability to generate enough commercial interest to expand its
business in the U.S.market, the Company recorded pre-tax
charges of $126million to other income expensein
the consolidated statements of operations during the year ended
December,31, 2002, for an other-than-temporary impairment
of its investment in GeneProt. The investment in GeneProt was
approximately $10million at December31, 2003 and
2002, and is included in other assets. In connection with
GeneProts canceled order of up to $200million 44 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued of mass spectrometry equipment, related systems
and services, the Company received approximately
$77million from GeneProt as a cancellation fee, which is
recorded in other income expensein the consolidated
statements of operations for the year ended December31,
2002. In June 2000, the Company formed a strategic
alliance with Variagenics,Inc. Variagenics,
a publicly traded company, to develop and commercialize genetic
variance reagent kits for use in the clinical development of
pharmaceutical products. Variagenics was considered a leader in
applying genetic variance information to the drug development
process. In July 2000, the Company paid Variagenics
$75million for a minority common stock equity ownership
and $30million for a license to manufacture and sell
reagents, and warrants to purchase common stock. The warrants to
purchase Variagenics common stock are exercisable at
$14per share for a period of 5years. The warrants
were valued at approximately $07million using the
Black-Scholes model. The investment in Variagenics is included
in other assets and carried at fair value with unrealized gains
and losses reported as a separate component of other
comprehensive income loss. During 2002 and 2001, the Company
recorded a $10million and $64million charge,
respectively, to other income expense, in the consolidated
statements of operations, for an other than temporary impairment
of the equity investment and warrants resulting from Variagenics
public stock price declines. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the
license with Variagenics described above was deemed fully
impaired as the technology collaboration program ceased, and the
Company abandoned the technology and the Company recorded a
$24million charge to impairment of long-lived intangible
asset in the consolidated statements of operations. The license
was being amortized on a straight-line basis over its useful
life of 15years. On January31, 2003 Variagenics was
merged with Hyseq Pharmaceuticals and is now named
Nuvelo,Inc. Nuvelo. The carrying amount,
which approximates market value, of the investment was
approximately $32million and $08million at
December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Other minority equity investments made during
2003 and 2002 were $18million and $45million,
respectively. Excluding the effects of currency, sales to these
entities during 2003 and 2002 were approximately
$14million and $70million, respectively. During 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded a
$03million and $01million charge, respectively, to
other income expensein the consolidated statements of
operations for the impairment of certain other equity
investments. At December31, 2003, no other investments and
long-lived assets were determined to be impaired. 6Acquisitions Creon In July 2003, the Company acquired, effective
July1, 2003, all of the capital stock of Creon, a Company
headquartered in Cologne, Germany, for approximately
$163million in cash. Creon specializes in Laboratory
Information Management Software LIMS solutions. The acquisition of Creon was accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting and the results of operations
of Creon have been included in the consolidated results of the
Company from the acquisition date. The purchase price of the
acquisition was allocated to tangible and intangible assets and
assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values. In
conjunction with the acquisition, the Company recorded a charge
of $60million for the write-off of acquired in-process
research and development. The technological feasibility of
in-process research and development projects had not been
established at the date of acquisition and they had no
alternative future use. The Company has allocated
$44million of the purchase price to intangible assets
comprised of customer lists and other purchased intangibles. The
excess purchase price of $56million after this allocation
has been accounted for as goodwill. The following represents the pro forma results of
the ongoing operations for Waters and Creon as though the
acquisition of Creon had occurred at the beginning of each
period shown in thousands, except per share data. The pro
forma results exclude expensed in-process research and
development. The pro forma 45 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Korea In February 2003, the Company acquired the
remaining 30% of its Korean distributor for approximately
$25million. The Company now owns 100% of its Korean
distributor. The purchase price of the acquisition has been
allocated to goodwill. The pro forma effects of the Rheometrics and
Korea acquisitions are immaterial. During 2002 and 2001, the Company made business
acquisitions totaling $59million and $26million,
respectively. The business acquisitions were accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting and the results of operations
of the acquired companies have been included in the consolidated
results of the Company from the acquisition date. The purchase
price of the acquisitions have been allocated to tangible and
intangible 47 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued assets and any assumed liabilities based on
respective fair market values. Any excess purchase price after
this allocation has been accounted for as goodwill. With respect
to the 2002 acquisitions, the Company allocated approximately
$26million of the purchase price to customer contracts
and non-compete covenants. Fixed assets and intangible assets
are being amortized over their expected useful lives. 7Expensed
In-Process Research and Development In connection with the acquisition of Creon, the
Company wrote-off the fair value of purchased IPRD of
various projects for the development of new products and
technologies in the amount of $60million. The amount was
determined by identifying research projects for which
technological feasibility had not been established and had no
alternative future uses. As of the acquisition date, there were
four projects that met the above criteria. The significant
IPRD projects identified consist of the ELab notebook
and the automatic LC-MS dereplication system. The IPRD
charges associated with these projects were $45million
and $08million, respectively. Management determined the valuation of the
IPRD using a number of factors, including engaging a third
party valuation firm to provide an independent appraisal. The
value was based primarily on the discounted cash flow method.
This valuation included consideration of ithe stage of
completion of each of the projects, iithe technological
feasibility of each of the projects, iiiwhether the
projects had an alternative future use, and ivthe
estimated future residual cash flows that could be generated
from the various projects and technologies over their respective
projected economic lives. The primary basis for determining the
technological feasibility of these projects was whether the
product has met predetermined design specifications and complex
functionality. As of the acquisition date, the IPRD
projects had not reached predetermined design specifications and
complex functionality. In assessing the technological
feasibility of a project, consideration was also given to the
level of complexity in future technological hurdles that each
project had to overcome. Future residual cash flows that could be
generated from each of the projects were determined based upon
managements estimate of future revenue and expected
profitability of the various products and technologies involved.
These projected cash flows were then discounted to their present
values taking into account managements estimate of future
expenses that would be necessary to bring the projects to
completion. The discount rates include a rate of return, which
accounts for the time value of money, as well as risk factors
that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may
not be realized. The cash flows were discounted at discount
rates ranging from 55% to 60%per annum, depending on the
projects stage of completion and the type of complex
functionality needed. This discounted cash flow methodology for
the various projects included in the purchased IPRD
resulted in a total valuation of $60million. Although
work on the projects related to the IPRD continued after
the acquisition, the amount of the purchase price allocated to
IPRD was written off because the projects underlying the
IPRD that was being developed were not considered
technologically feasible as of the acquisition date. As of
December31, 2003, the IPRD projects still had not
reached technological feasibility. The expected remaining costs
to complete these projects are not considered material to the
Company and there are currently no expected material variations
between projected results from the projects versus those at the
time of the acquisition. The Company expects the projects to be
completed within the next twelve months. 8Divestiture of
Business On March26, 2003, the Company sold the net
assets of its mass spectrometry inorganic product line for
approximately $12million in cash and the balance in notes
receivable. Assets sold included inventory and certain accounts
receivable, and liabilities assumed by the acquirer consisted of
deferred service revenue and advance payment obligations, and
warranty and installation obligations. The Company recorded a
loss on 48 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued disposal of approximately $50million,
including severance costs of approximately $03million.
This business generated sales of approximately
$140million per year with no significant effects to
earnings per share results. 9Goodwill and
Other Intangibles The carrying amount of goodwill was
$1966million and $1679million at December31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase of $287million
is attributable to the Companys three acquisitions
Note6during the period of approximately
$231million and currency translation adjustments of
approximately $56million. The Companys intangible assets included in
the consolidated balance sheets are detailed as follows in

During the year ended December31, 2003, the
Company retired approximately $44million in fully
amortized purchased intangibles and $37million in fully
amortized other intangibles, that were no longer in use. For the years ended December31, 2003, 2002
and 2001 amortization expense for intangible assets was
$119million, $112million, and $133million,
respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets is
estimated to be approximately $125million for each of the
next five years. At December31, 2003 and 2002, intangible
assets above reflect the change in accounting for patent related
costs as discussed in Note2. 10Debt In February 2002, the Company entered into an
agreement Credit Agreement that provided for a
$2500million line of credit, unsecured in nature and an
expiration date in February 2007. Loans under the Credit
Agreement bore interest for each calendar quarter at an annual
rate equal to, at the Companys option, 1the
applicable LIBOR rate plus a varying margin between 060% and
150% or 2prime rate. In December 2003, the Company amended its
existing $2500million Credit Agreement Amended
Credit Agreement dated February 2002 by closing on a
$1250million Add-On Term LoanFacility Term
Loan. Proceeds from the Term Loan will be used to repay
borrowings under the Credit Agreement, repurchase stock and for
general corporate purposes. The applicable interest changed from
being based on the ratio of debt to total capitalization to debt
to EBITDA. Loans under the Amended Credit Agreement will bear
interest for each quarter at a floating rate equal to, at the
Companys option, 1the applicable LIBOR rate plus a
varying margin between 060% and 150% or 2prime rate. At
December31, 2003, the interest rates, with respect to the
Amended Credit Agreement and Term Loan, ranged from 178% to
195%. At December31, 2002, there were no borrowings under
this facility. There have been no material changes to the
remaining terms and conditions. The credit facility in place through February
2002 provided a $4500million line of credit. Loans under
the facility bore interest for each calendar quarter at an
annual rate equal to, at the Companys option, 1the
applicable LIBOR rate plus a varying margin between 030% and
100% or 2prime rate. Margins on LIBOR borrowings varied
with the Companys financial performance. Borrowings were
collateralized by substantially 49 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued all of the Companys assets. The Company was
also required to meet certain covenants, none of which was
considered restrictive to operations. At December31, 2003, the Company had
borrowings under the $2500million Amended Credit
Agreement of $1000million and an amount available to
borrow of $1477million, after outstanding letters of
credit. At December31, 2003, the $1250million Term
Loan was fully drawn. At December31, 2002, the Company had
no aggregate borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement
and had amounts available to borrow of $2480million,
after outstanding letters of credit. The Company, and its foreign subsidiaries, also
had available short-term lines of credit, totaling
$960million at December31, 2003 and
$841million at December31, 2002. At
December31, 2003 and 2002, related short-term borrowings
were $213million at a weighted average interest rate of
211% and $75million at a weighted average interest rate
of 278%, respectively. 50 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The income tax benefits associated with
nonqualified stock option compensation expense recognized for
tax purposes and credited to additional paid-in capital were
$176million, $70million and $127million for
the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The deferred tax benefit of net operating losses
and credits is broken out as follows: $519million
$1483million pre-tax in U.S.operating loss
carryforwards that begin to expire in 2020; $520million
in foreign tax credits, of which $331million expire in
2004; $36million in research and development credits that
begin to expire in 2009; $09million in alternative
minimum income tax credits with no expiration date; and
$26million $88million pre-tax in foreign net
operating losses with no expiration date. Because of the
outstanding stock options, which the Company anticipates will
result in net operating loses well into the future, the Company
believes that it is more likely than not that the
U.S.deferred tax benefit of $1283million will not
be realized, therefore, a valuation allowance has reduced to
zero all the deferred tax benefit relating to U.S.income.
The deferred tax liabilities relate primarily to the
U.S.To the extent that the deferred tax assets relate to
stock option deductions, the resultant benefits, if and when
realized, will be credited to stockholders equity. During
the year ended December31, 2003, the Company received an
alternative minimum income tax refund of $02million,
resulting from a net operating loss carryback. Net deferred tax assets included in other current
assets totaled $45million and $26million at
December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net deferred tax
liabilities included in other liabilities totaled
$93million at December31, 2003 and there were no
such liabilities at December31, 2002. The Companys effective tax rate for the
years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were 236 221% and 223%, respectively. The Companys effective tax
rate benefited primarily from the preferential tax rate of 10%
afforded by its Irish operations. The Irish rate will increase
to 125% in 2011. The effect of the 52 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Irish operation is a benefit of approximately
$230million or $019per share for the year ended
December31, 2003. The results of the balance of foreign
operations had an insignificant impact on the Companys
effective tax rate. At December31, 2003, there were unremitted
earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately
$6443million. The Company has not provided
U.S.income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on these
earnings as it is the Companys intention to permanently
reinvest the earnings outside the U.S.It is not
practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might
be payable if such earnings were remitted to the U.S. 12Patent
Litigation Applera Corporation PE Corporation since renamed Applera
Corporation, MDS, Inc. and Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex
the Plaintiffs filed a civil action against
Micromass UK Limited and Micromass, Inc., wholly owned
subsidiaries of the Company, in the U.S.District Court for
the District of Delaware the Court on
February18, 2000. The Plaintiffs alleged that the Quattro
Ultima triple quadrupole mass spectrometer infringes
U.S.Patent No4,963,736 the patent.
The patent is owned by MDS, Inc. and licensed to a joint venture
with Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments. In March2002, the Company was informed of a
jurys finding that the Quattro Ultima with Mass Transit
ion tunnel technology infringes the patent. The same jury found
that the infringement was not willful and determined damages in
the amount of $475million. The Court entered an
injunction in which the Company is enjoined from making, using
and selling in the U.S. the Quattro Ultima triple quadrupole
mass spectrometer incorporating features of the patent. In March 2003, the Courts decision was
affirmed on appeal. In April 2003, the Company paid total
damages and interest of approximately $537million to the
Plaintiffs. These instruments are manufactured in the United
Kingdom and shipments to the rest of the world outside the
United States are not subject to this litigation. Similar claims
were asserted against the Company by the Plaintiffs in Japan and
Canada. The accrued patent litigation expenses of
$199million and $749million recorded as of
December31, 2003 and December31, 2002, respectively,
in the consolidated balance sheets, is the Companys best
estimate of its exposure for this liability. During the year
ended December31, 2003, the Company recorded a
$05million pre-tax charge for additional liabilities
associated with interest costs. During the year ended
December31, 2003, the Company paid damages and interest of
$537million, made legal expense payments of
$04million, and reversed approximately $09million
of interest as a credit to interest expense in the fourth
quarter. MDS, Inc. and Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex
Instruments filed a civil action against Micromass UK Limited,
Waters Limited, wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, and
the Company, in the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division,
Patents Courts, UK on October31, 2003. The case alleged
that certain of the Companys MS products infringe European
Patent UK No0373835 the European
Patent. To the Companys knowledge, the European
patent is owned by MDS, Inc. and licensed to a joint venture
with Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments. The Plaintiffs in
this action were seeking an injunction against the Company to
restrain it from infringing the European Patent and an
unspecified award of damages. Previously, in July 2002, the Company filed a
civil action against Applera Corporation alleging patent
infringement of U.S. Patent No5,304,798 owned by the
Company. In November 2002, the University of Manitoba the
University and Applera Corporation, its
licensee, filed a civil action against the Company alleging
patent infringement of U.S. Patent No6,331,702 owned by
the University. See March 2004 update in Note22. 53 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Hewlett-Packard Company The Company filed suit in the United States
against Hewlett-Packard Company and Hewlett-Packard GmbH
collectively, HP, seeking a declaration that
certain products sold under the mark Alliance do not
constitute an infringement of one or more patents owned by HP or
its foreign subsidiaries the HP patents. The
action in the United States was dismissed for lack of
controversy. Actions seeking revocation or nullification of
foreign HP patents were filed by the Company in Germany, France
and England. A German patent tribunal found the HP German patent
to be valid. In Germany, France and England, HP and its
successor, Agilent Technologies Deutschland GmbH, have brought
an action alleging that certain features of the Alliance pump
may infringe the HP patents. In England, the Court of Appeal has
found the HP patent valid and infringed. The Companys
petitions for leave to appeal to the House of Lords have been
denied. In France, the Paris District Court has found the HP
patent valid and infringed by the Alliance pump. The Company has
appealed the French decision. A German court has found the
patent infringed. The Company has appealed the German decision.
The Company recorded a provision in the quarter ended
June30, 2002 for estimated damages incurred with respect
to this ongoing litigation. This provision represents
managements best estimate of the probable and reasonably
estimable loss related to this litigation. PerkinElmer Corporation The Company, through its subsidiary TAI, asserted
a claim against The PerkinElmer Corporation PE
alleging patent infringement of three patents owned by TAI the
TAI patents. PE counterclaimed for infringement of
a patent owned by PE the PE patent. The
U.S.District Court for the District of Delaware granted
judgment as a matter of law in favor of TAI and enjoined PE from
infringing the TAI patents. PE appealed the District Court
judgment in favor of TAI to the federal appellate court. The
District Courts judgment, with respect to PEs
infringement of the TAI patents, was affirmed. The District
Courts judgment with respect to TAIs
non-infringement of the PE patent was reversed and remanded to
the District Court for further proceedings. On remand to the District Court in
October2002, a jury found PE liable to TAI for damages of
$133million and found TAI did not infringe the PE patent.
In May2003, the District Court entered judgment on the
jurys verdict in favor of the Company. PE has appealed the
judgment with respect to TAIs non-infringement of the PE
patent. As of December31, 2003, no gain has been recorded
and all litigation costs have been expensed as incurred. Other Cohesive Technologies, Inc.
Cohesive has brought three suits against the
Company in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts. Cohesive
alleges that several products of the Company, which are part of
a much larger product line, are an infringement of two Cohesive
U.S.Patents. The Company has denied infringement of such
patents and has asserted several defenses. Two of the products
alleged to be an infringement are now obsolete and are no longer
sold in the United States. During the fourth quarter of 2001, a
jury returned a verdict in one of the suits finding the Company
liable for infringement of one of the two patents. The Company
intends to continue to vigorously defend its position. Judgment
has not been entered on the jurys verdict and further
proceedings may preclude such entry. The Company believes it has
meritorious positions and should prevail either through judgment
or on appeal, although the outcome is not certain. The Company
believes that any outcome of the proceedings will not be
material to the Company. Viscotek Corporation Viscotek filed
a civil action against the Company in the Federal District Court
for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, alleging
that one option offered by the Company with a high temperature
gel permeation chromatography instrument is an infringement of
two of its patents. These patents are owned by E.I.DuPont
deNemours and Company DuPont and claimed to
be exclusively licensed to Viscotek. DuPont is not a party to
the suit. On January16, 2004, a jury returned a verdict
finding that the Company had not infringed Viscoteks
patents. Judgment has not been entered on the jurys verdict 54 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued and further post trial motions and appeals by
Viscotek may preclude such entry. The Company believes it should
prevail either through judgment or appeal and that any outcome
of the proceedings will not be material to the Company. 13Environmental
Contingency In July 2003, the Company entered into a
settlement agreement the Environmental Settlement
Agreement with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, acting
by and through the Attorney General and the Department of
Environmental Protection, with respect to alleged non-compliance
with state environmental laws at its Taunton, Massachusetts
facility. Pursuant to the terms of a final judgment entered in
the Superior Court of the Commonwealth on July10, 2003,
the Company paid a civil penalty of $59million. In
addition, the Company has agreed to conduct a Supplemental
Environmental Project in the amount of $06million,
comprised of investments in capital infrastructure, to study the
effects of bio-filtration on certain air emissions from the
Taunton facility and for the purchase of equipment in connection
therewith. Pursuant to the terms of the Environmental Settlement
Agreement, the Company has also agreed to undertake a variety of
actions to ensure that air emissions from the facility do not
exceed certain limits and that the facility is brought into full
compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. 14Restructuring
and Other Unusual Charges In July 2002, the Company took action to
restructure and combine its field sales, service and
distribution of its Micromass and HPLC operations. The objective
of this integration is to leverage the strengths of both
divisions and align and reduce operating expenses. The
integration efforts impacted the U.S., Canada, continental
Europe and the United Kingdom. Approximately 55 employees were
to be terminated, of which all had left the Company as of
December31, 2003. In addition, the Company committed to
closing four sales and distribution facilities, of which one was
closed by December31, 2003. The Company is in various
stages of terminating distributor contracts, of which two were
closed by December31, 2003. The Company recorded $26million of charges
for the year ended December31, 2003 and $74million
for the year ended December31, 2002, for restructuring and
other directly related incremental charges relating to its
integration of the worldwide HPLC and MS sales, service and
support organizations. The charge for the year ended
December31, 2003 includes severance costs for 13 people,
distributor termination costs and other directly related
incremental costs of this integration effort. The charge for the
year ended December31, 2002 includes severance costs for
42 people, contract cancellation fees, non-cancelable lease
obligations and other directly related incremental costs. During the year ended December31, 2003, the
Company reversed approximately $19million in
restructuring reserves, primarily attributable to facility
closure and distributor termination costs being less than
previously estimated and the retention of certain employees
previously selected for termination. There were no such
reversals in 2002. The Company has included in the consolidated
balance sheet in other long-term liabilities approximately
$15million and $18million at December31,
2003 and 2002, respectively, for non-cancelable lease
obligations with a portion to be paid extending out to 2012. The
remaining $11million and $37 of the liability is
included in other current liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheet at December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 55 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

subsidiary for severance and other related costs in the year
ended December31, 2003. There were no such charges for the
year ended December31, 2002. 15Other
Commitments and Contingencies Lease agreements, expiring at various dates

The Company licenses certain technology and
software from third parties, which expire at various dates
through 2008. Fees paid for licenses were approximately
$29million in 2003, $54million in 2002, and
$40million in 2001. Future minimum licenses payable under
existing license agreements as of December31, 2003 are
$08million, $04million, for the years ended
December31, 2004 and 2005, respectively, and are
immaterial for the year ended December31, 2006 and
thereafter. From time to time, the Company and its
subsidiaries are involved in various litigation matters arising
in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it has
meritorious arguments and any outcome, either individually or in
the aggregate, with the exception of the current litigation
described in Note12, Patent Litigation and Note13,
Environmental Contingency, will not be material to the financial
position or results of operations. The Company enters into standard indemnification
agreements in its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these
agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees
to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or
incurred by the indemnified party, generally our business
partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or
other intellectual property infringement claims by any third
party with respect to our current products, as well as claims
relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from
the performance of services by us or our subcontractors. The
maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required
to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited.
Historically, our costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims
relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and we
accordingly believe the estimated fair value of these agreements
is immaterial. 56 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Retirement Plans The Company has two retirement plans for
U.S.employees: the Waters Employee Investment Plan, a
defined contribution plan, and the Waters Retirement Plan, a
defined benefit cash balance plan. U.S.employees are eligible to participate
in the Waters Employee Investment Plan after one month of
service. Employees may contribute from 1% to 30% of eligible pay
on a pre-tax basis. After one year of service, the Company makes
a matching contribution of 50% for contributions up to 6% of
eligible pay. Employees are 100% vested in employee and company
matching contributions. For the years ended December31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, the Companys matching contributions
amounted to $29million, $27million and
$24million, respectively. U.S.employees are eligible to participate
in the Waters Retirement Plan after one year of service.
Annually, the Company credits each employees account as a
percentage of eligible pay based on years of service. In
addition, each employees account is credited for
investment returns at the beginning of each year for the prior
year at the average12month Treasury Bill rate plus
05%, limited to a minimum rate of 5% and a maximum rate of 10%.
An employee does not vest until the completion of five years of
service at which time the employee becomes 100% vested. 60 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The net periodic pension cost under SFAS87,
Employers Accounting for Pensions, is made up of several
components that reflect different aspects of the Companys
financial arrangements as well as the cost of benefits earned by
employees. These components are determined using the projected
unit credit actuarial cost method and are based on certain
actuarial assumptions. The Companys accounting policy is
to reflect in the projected benefit obligation all benefit
changes to which the Company is committed as of the current
valuation date; use a market-related value of assets to
determine pension expense; amortize increases in prior service
costs on a straight-line basis over the expected future service
of active participants as of the date such costs are first
recognized; and amortize cumulative actuarial gains and losses
in excess of 10% of the larger of the market-related value of
plan assets and the projected benefit obligation over the
expected future service of active participants. Summary data for the Waters Retirement Plan are
presented in the following tables, using the measurement date of

targets were 72% equity and 28% fixed income. The rebalancing
towards the new targets is accomplished through the investment
of future contributions. The asset allocation policy was developed in
consideration of the following long-term investment objectives:
achieving a return on assets consistent with the investment
policy, maximizing portfolio returns with at least a return of
25% above the one-year Treasury Bill rate, and achieving
portfolio returns which exceeds the average return for similarly
invested funds. The Company increased its allocation to debt
securities during 2003 from 26% to 32% based on the new target
allocation. The increase in fixed income securities will help
better match the interest rate sensitivity of the pension
liabilities and limit the risk associated with equity funds.
Within the equity portfolio, investments are diversified among
capitalization and style. Up to 20% of the equity portfolio may
be invested in financial markets outside of the United States.
The Company does not invest in its own stock within the pension
assets. The Company prohibits the following types of
assets or transactions: short selling, margin transactions,
commodities and future contracts, private placements, options
and letter stock.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return
on assets assumption, the Company considered the historical
returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset
class, as well as the target asset allocation of the pension
portfolio and historical expenses paid by the plan. This
resulted in the selection of the 800% long-term rate of return
on assets assumption, net of expenses paid by the plan. During fiscal year 2004, the Company expects to
contribute $100million to the plan. 20Business
Segment Information SFAS131, Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information, establishes
standards for reporting information about operating segments in
annual financial statements and requires selected information
for those segments to be presented in interim financial reports
of public business enterprises. It also establishes standards
for related disclosures about products and service, geographic
areas and major customers. The Company evaluated its business
activities that are regularly reviewed by the chief
decision-makers for which separate discrete financial
information is available. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2003, the
Company completed the integration of the HPLC and MS worldwide
sales, service and support organizations. Accordingly, the
Micromass operating segment Micromass has been
integrated into the Waters operating segment. 63 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Waters is in the business of manufacturing and
distributing HPLC instruments, columns, other consumables and
mass spectrometry instruments that can be integrated and used
along with other analytical instruments. TAI is in the business
of manufacturing and distributing thermal analysis and rheology
instruments. The Companys two operating segments have
similar economic characteristics, product processes, products
and services, types and classes of customers, methods of
distribution, and regulatory environments. Because of these
similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one
reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Please refer
to the consolidated financial statements for financial
information regarding the one reportable segment of the Company. Geographic information is presented below in

The Company experiences a seasonal increase in
sales in the fourth quarter, as a result of purchasing habits on
capital goods of customers that tend to exhaust their spending
budgets by calendar year-end. Selling, general and expenses were
lower in the first quarters of 2003 and 2002 compared to other
quarters in respective calendar years due to foreign currency
translation, lower spending in marketing programs and lower
costs such as sales commissions and incentive plans directly
related to sales volume. In addition, expenses are traditionally
higher in the second quarter of each year as this is the
Companys annual payroll merit increase period. 66 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued 22Subsequent
Events In January 2004, the Company initiated a
restructuring effort to realign its personnel between various
support functions and various field, sales and service
organizations. As a result, approximately 80employees are
to be terminated, primarily in the U.S., in the first quarter of
2004. A similar number of new employees are to be hired in
various geographies around the world, primarily in sales and
service functions with the goal of increasing sales. The Company
expects to record a restructuring charge of approximately
$20million in the first quarter of 2004. In the first quarter of 2004, the Company
acquired 100% of the Common Stock of NuGenesis Technologies
Corporation for approximately $432million in cash. This
transaction will be accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting. During the first quarter of 2004, the Company will
record each acquired asset and liability assumed at its fair
value, which is subject to future adjustment when appraisals or
other valuation data have been obtained. On March2, 2004, the Company and MDS, Inc.
through its Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments partnership
and Applied Biosystems entered into a settlement agreement the
Applera Settlement Agreement with respect to the
various civil actions pending against each of them, both in the
United States and internationally. Stipulations of Dismissal or
their foreign equivalents the Stipulations with
respect to the disposal of all such actions have been submitted
to the applicable courts and tribunals in each of the United
States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan. The Applera Settlement Agreement provides for the
resolution of all patent infringement claims in the United
States made by certain of the parties against the other and of
international cases brought by MDS, Inc. and Applied
Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments against the Company with
respect to alleged infringements of those parties patents
at issue in the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan. In consideration of entering into the Applera
Settlement Agreement and the Stipulations, the Company and MDS,
Inc. and Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments have entered
into royalty paying license agreements cross licensing the use
of the technology described in the parties respective
patents at issue. In addition, the Company made a one-time
payment to Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments of
$181million on March11, 2004, which is fully
accrued at December31, 2003. 67 Table of Contents SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SECs rules and forms bChanges in Internal Controls No change in the Companys internal control
