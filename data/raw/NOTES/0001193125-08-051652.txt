Description of Business Deltic Timber Corporation Deltic
or the Company is a natural resources company engaged primarily in the growing and harvesting of timber and the manufacture and marketing of lumber. Deltic owns approximately 439,000 acres of timberland, primarily in Arkansas and north
Louisiana. The Companys sawmill operations are located at Ola in central Arkansas and at Waldo in south Arkansas. In addition to its timber and lumber operations, the Company is engaged in real estate development in central Arkansas. The
Company also holds a 50 percent interest in Del-Tin Fiber, L.L.C., a joint venture to manufacture and market medium density fiberboard. Business environment The Company is primarily a wood products producer operating in a commodity-based business environment with a major diversification in real estate development. This environment is
affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions, interest rates, imports, foreign exchange rates, housing starts, residential repair and remodeling, commercial construction, industry capacity and production levels, the
availability of raw materials and weather conditions. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial
statements of Deltic Timber Corporation include the accounts of Deltic and all majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of significant intercompany transactions and accounts. Use of Estimates In the preparation of the Companys financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, management has made a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from
those estimates. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents include investments that have a maturity of three months
or less from the date of purchase. Accounts Receivable The Company records trade accounts receivable at net
realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. Our allowance is based
upon review of specific receivables outstanding and considers factors such as current overall economic conditions, industry-specific economic conditions, historical customer performance and anticipated customer performance. At December31, 2007
and 2006, the balance in the allowance account was $52,000 and $55,000, respectively. Inventories 
Inventories of logs, lumber, and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or market, primarily using the average cost method. Log costs include harvest and transportation cost as appropriate. Lumber costs include materials, labor, and production
overhead. For additional information, see Note 2 Inventories. Investment in Real Estate Held for Development
and Sale Real estate held for development and sale is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and includes direct costs of land and land development and indirect costs, including amenities. Indirect and amenity costs are
allocated to individual lots or acreage sold based on relative sales value. Direct costs are allocated on a specific neighborhood basis, while indirect costs for the Companys four development areas Chenal Valley, Chenal Downs, Red Oak
Ridge, and the currently suspended The Ridges at Nowlin Creek are allocated to neighborhoods over the entire respective development area based on relative retail values. Investment in Del-Tin Fiber Investment in Del-Tin Fiber L.L.C. Del-Tin Fiber, a 50 percent-owned limited
liability company, is accounted for using the equity method and evaluated for possible impairment, as applicable under the requirements

Policies cont. 
of Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. At
December31, 2007 and 2006, the Companys share of the underlying net assets of Del-Tin Fiber exceeded its investment by $15,820,000 and $16,883,000, respectively. The difference relates primarily to the Companys write-off of its
carrying amount for its investment in Del-Tin Fiber as of December31, 2002, which was not recorded by Del-Tin. The equity in earnings of Del-Tin recognized by the Company exceeds its ownership percentage of Del-Tins earnings because the
difference in basis between the Company and Del-Tin is being adjusted to account for Del-Tins operating results as if it were a consolidated subsidiary. Cash advances to the joint venture are recorded as increases in the Companys
investment carrying value, while cash distributions received from the joint venture result in reductions in investment carrying value. For additional information, see Note 4 Investment in Del-Tin Fiber. Timber and Timberlands Timber and timberlands, which includes purchased stumpage inventory and logging facilities, is
stated at acquisition cost less cost of fee timber harvested and accumulated depreciation of logging facilities and includes no estimated future reforestation cost. The cost of fee timber harvested is based on the volume of timber harvested in
relation to the estimated volume of timber recoverable. Logging facilities, which consist primarily of roads constructed and other land improvements, are depreciated using the straight-line method over a ten-year estimated life. The Company
estimates its fee timber inventory using statistical information and data obtained from physical measurements and other information gathering techniques. The cost of timber and timberland purchased and reforestation costs are capitalized. Fee timber
carrying costs are expensed as incurred. Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment
assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of buildings, equipment, and other depreciable assets is primarily determined using the straight-line method. Expenditures that substantially improve and/or increase the useful
life of facilities or equipment are capitalized. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Gains and losses on disposals or retirements are recognized in the period they occur. Property, plant, and equipment assets are evaluated for possible impairment on a specific asset basis or in groups of similar assets, as applicable,
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted
future net cash flows to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the
asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and depreciation ceases. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met: 1 persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, 2delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, 3
the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable, and 4collectibility is reasonably assured. Delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. Revenue from the sale of
lumber and wood by-products is recorded at the time of shipment due to terms of such sale being designated free on board f.o.b. shipping point. Revenue from the sale of timber-cutting rights to third parties is recorded when legal
title passes to the purchaser, which is generally upon delivery of a legally executed timber deed and receipt of payment for the timber. Revenue from intersegment timber sales is recorded when the timber is harvested; such intersegment sales, which
are made at prices which generally approximate market, are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

Revenue from the leasing of land for hunting purposes is deferred when received and subsequently recognized over the one-year lease term which begins
September1. At December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had deferred hunting lease revenue totaling $1,165,000 and $1,116,000, respectively, reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in deferred revenues and other accrued liabilities.
Revenue from bonus payments under mineral leases is deferred and recognized over the lease term, while related royalty payments are recognized when received. At December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had deferred mineral lease revenue of
$5,891,000 and $4,948,000, respectively of which $4,116,000 and $3,621,000 is included in other noncurrent liabilities and $1,775,000 and $1,327,000 is included in other current liabilities. Revenue from timberland and real estate is recorded under
the criteria of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. Such revenue is recorded when the sale is closed and legal
title is transferred, which is generally at the time the purchaser executes the real estate closing documents and makes payment to the title company handling the closing. Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, the
provision for income taxes includes amounts currently payable and amounts deferred as tax assets and liabilities, based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities, and is
measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Property Taxes Property taxes applicable to the Companys assets are estimated and accrued in the period of
assessment. At December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had accrued property tax expense totaling $1,470,000 and $1,507,000, respectively, reflected in the consolidated balance sheet in accrued taxes other than income taxes. Stock-Based Compensation On January1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement No123 R, Share-Based Payment, SFAS 123 R. Prior to January1, 2006, Deltic accounted for share-based payments under the recognition and measurement
provisions of APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, and the related Interpretations, as permitted by FASB Statement No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS 123. Stock-based employee compensation was accrued for the intrinsic value, if any, of stock options or restricted stock granted over the applicable vesting periods using the straight-line method. Options granted by the Company
have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the date of the grant. The Company adopted SFAS 123
Rusing the modified-prospective method. Under the transition method, compensation cost recognized in future interim and annual reporting periods includes: 1compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet
vested as of January1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123, and 2compensation cost for all share-based payment granted subsequent to January1, 2006, based on the
grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123 R. The results for prior periods have not been restated.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income after tax and net income per common share as
if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to stock-based compensation during 2005.  Thousands of dollars, except per share amounts
2005 Net income, as reported 14,518 Plus total stock-based compensation expense determined under the intrinsic value method for awards, net of related tax effects, included in
the determination of net income 766 Less pro forma total stock-based compensation expense determined under the fair value method for all awards, net of related tax
effects 955 Pro forma net income 14,329 Basic earnings per share As reported 118 Pro forma 117 Dilutive earnings per share As reported 117 Pro forma 116
For the pro forma net income calculation in the preceding table, the fair value of each option on
the date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the following assumptions for awards in 2005: dividend yield of 81 percent; expected volatility of 3154 percent; risk-free interest rate of 383 percent; and expected
lives of five years. Using these assumptions, the weighted average grant-date fair value per share of options granted in 2005 was $1535. The adoption of SFAS No123 Rhad an impact on the Companys results of operations. The consolidated statements of income for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 included $2,676,000 and $1,207,000,
respectively, of stock-based compensation expense reflected in general and administrative expenses. SFAS No123 Rrequires the
benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under APB 25 and related interpretations. This requirement increased net financing cash
flows, rather than net operating cash flows, for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 by $306,000 and $611,000, respectively. The cumulative effect related to outstanding restricted stock awards as of December31, 2005, which are not
expected to vest based on an estimate of forfeitures, was not material. 
53 Table of Contents DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2007 Note 1 Significant Accounting
Policies cont. 
Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No123 R, stock-based compensation cost
is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award. For valuation of stock options granted subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No123 R, Deltic
elected to use a binomial model to estimate fair value. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined by reference to the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. For restricted stock performance units
subsequent to Deltics adoption of SFAS No123 R, the Monte Carlo simulation is being used to estimate fair value. For all awards subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No123 R, the Company recognizes compensation cost on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Deltic issues restricted stock performance units whose vesting is contingent upon
meeting certain financial performance goals based upon the Companys total stockholder return compared to the total return of a Paper and Forest Products Index selected by the Compensation Committee and calculated by Standard and Poors.
Determining the appropriate amount to expense is based on likelihood of achievement of the stated goals and requires judgement, including forecasting future financial results. This estimate is revised periodically based on the probability of
achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are made as appropriate. The cumulative impact of any revision is reflected in the period of change. The Company uses historical volatility over a ten-year trading life to determine volatility assumptions. Risk-free interest rates are based on historical rates and forward-looking factors. The expected dividend yield
is based on the Companys average dividend yield from 2004 to 2006. The pre-vesting forfeiture rate is based on historical rates and forward-looking factors. The expected option term is based on the term of the option and historical exercise
and expiration experience. Assumptions for the 2007, 2006, and 2005 valuation of stock options and restricted stock performance units
consisted of the following:  2007 2006 2005 Weighted expected volatility
2872 2897 3154 Dividend yield
064 076 081 Expected term of options in years
627 627 500 Risk-free interest rate
476 443 383 Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Company sponsors both
a qualified and a nonqualified, noncontributory, defined benefit retirement plan that covers substantially all employees. Benefits are based on years of service and final career-average-pay formulas as defined by the plans. The qualified plan is
funded to accumulate sufficient assets to provide for accrued benefits. The nonqualified plan, a supplemental executive plan, is not funded; the Company pays any benefits due under this plan on a monthly basis. The Company also sponsors a defined benefit health care plan and a life insurance benefit plan for substantially all retired employees. The Company
measures the costs of its obligations for these plans based on its health care cost trends and actuarial assumptions. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn these postretirement benefits. For
additional information, see Note 15 Employee and Retiree Benefit Plans.

Advertising Costs Advertising costs, primarily related to marketing
efforts for the Companys real estate developments, are expensed as incurred. These costs amounted to $1,148,000 in 2007, $863,000 in 2006 and $790,000 in 2005, and are reflected in cost of sales on the consolidated statements of income.
Capitalized Interest The Company capitalizes interest for qualifying constructed assets under the provisions
of SFAS 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost. Interest is mainly capitalized as an indirect cost for real estate development in the Companys real estate operations. For additional information, see Note 17 Supplemental Cash
Flow Disclosures. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures include additions to investment in real estate
held for development and sale; timber and timberlands; and property, plant, and equipment. Net Change in Purchased
Stumpage Inventory Purchased stumpage inventory consists of timber-cutting rights purchased from third parties specifically for use in the Companys sawmills. Depending on the timing of acquisition and usage of this acquired stumpage
inventory, the net change in this inventory can either be a source or use of funds in the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows. Earnings per Common Share Earnings per share EPS amounts presented are calculated under the provisions of the SFAS 128, Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per share is computed
based on earnings available to common shareholders [net income/loss less accrued preferred dividends, if any] and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The earnings per share assuming the diluted amounts presented are computed
based on earnings available to common shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, including shares assumed to be issued under the Companys stock incentive plans. For a reconciliation of amounts used in per share
computations, see Note 18 Earnings per Share. Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling
costs, such as freight to our customers destinations, are accounted for in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue 00-10. As such, shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales in the Companys
consolidated statements of income. These costs, when included in the amount invoiced to customers, are also recognized in net sales. Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued a revision to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. This revision requires the Company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The cost will be recognized over the period
during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. This revised statement was originally effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June15, 2005. It applies
to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified, repurchased, or canceled after that date. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced the adoption of a new rule that amends the compliance dates for
SFAS 123 Rand allows for the implementation of SFAS 123 Rat the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after June15, 2005. Accordingly, the Company elected to adopt the revised statement effective for its first quarter
2006 financial statements. As required, cost of stock-based compensation was recognized for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of December31, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value of
those awards. The granting of stock-based compensation is at the discretion of the Companys Executive Compensation Committee the Committee. The effect of adoption of SFAS 123 Rwas comparable to the amounts reflected in
the pro forma disclosures as presented in the stock-based compensation policy included within this footnote.

In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No156, Accounting for Services of Financial
Assets. This statement amends SFAS No140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. The effective date of SFAS No156 is generally as of the start date of the first
fiscal year beginning after September15, 2006. The adoption of SFAS No156 did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. This interpretation prescribes a
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company adopted FIN 48 in January of 2007. For additional information, see
Note 11 Income Taxes. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements. This statement
applies when other accounting pronouncements require fair value measurements. It does not require new fair value measurements. SFAS No157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007,
and interim periods within those years. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No157 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, SFAS No158, an
amendment of FASB Statements No87, 88, 106 and 132 R. SFAS No158 represents the completion of the first phase in the FASBs postretirement benefits accounting project and requires an employer that is a business entity and
sponsors one or more single employer benefit plans to 1recognize the over-funded or under-funded status of the benefit plan in its statement of financial position, 2recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax,
the gains or losses and prior service costs of credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost, 3measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the end of the employers
fiscal year, and 4disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service
costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. The provisions of SFAS No158 were adopted as of December31, 2006, except for the measurement date provisions, which are effective for fiscal years ending December15, 2008.
Based on the funded status of the Companys pension plans as of September30, 2006, the adoption of SFAS No158 reduced total stockholders equity by $5,016,000. For additional information, see Note 15 Employee and
Retiree Benefit Plans. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities, including an amendment of SFAS No115. This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing
entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. This statement is expected to expand the use of
fair value measurement, which is consistent with the FASBs long-term measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments. SFAS 159 is effective for the Company beginning January1, 2008. The Company does not expect the
adoption of SFAS 159 to have material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In June 2007, the Emerging Issues Task Force of FASB
reached a consensus on Issue No06-11, Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards. Issue No06-11 is effective for the tax benefit of dividends declared by the Company beginning
January1, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of Issue No06-11 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141 revised 2007 Business Combinations.
SFAS No141 Restablishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the
goodwill acquired. SFAS No141 Ralso establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No141 Ris effective for fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2008. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No51. SFAS No160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of
consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parents ownership interest, and valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No160
also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15,
2008, and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
SAB No108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements. SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior-year uncorrected misstatements should
be considered when quantifying misstatements in current-year financial statements. SAB 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income-statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in
quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. Deltic applied the provisions for its financial statements at December31, 2006. For additional information, see Note 19 Staff Accounting

2,397 Note 4 Investment in Del-Tin Fiber Deltic owns 50 percent of the membership of Del-Tin Fiber, which completed construction and commencedproduction operations of a medium density
fiberboard MDF plant near El Dorado, Arkansas, during 1998. At December31, 2007 and 2006, the Companys share of
the underlying net assets of Del-Tin Fiber exceeded its investment by $15,820,000 and $16,883,000, respectively. The difference relates primarily to the Companys write-off of its carrying amount for its investment in Del-Tin Fiber as of
December31, 2002, which was not recorded by Del-Tin. The equity in earnings of Del-Tin recognized by the Company exceeds its ownership percentage of Del-Tins earnings because the difference in basis between the Company and Del-Tin is
being adjusted to account for Del-Tins operating results as if it were a consolidated subsidiary. Cumulative net losses for the
facility have amounted to $87,514,000, of which $43,757,000 is the Companys share. During 2007, 2006, and 2005 the Company received $3,876,000, $3,950,000, and $3,800,000 in distributions from Del-Tin Fiber, respectively. Contributions to
Del-Tin Fiber by the Company as of December31, 2007, have amounted to $80,864,000. On August26, 2004, the Company executed a
guarantee agreement in connection with the refinancing of the debt of Del-Tin Fiber. Under Deltics guarantee agreement, the Company unconditionally guarantees the payment of 50 percent $20,500,000 at December31, 2007 of Del-Tin
Fibers credit agreement. The Company estimated the proportionate fair value of its guarantee of Del-Tins credit agreement to be $3,450,000. The Company is reducing this liability systematically over the life of the credit agreement, as
the Company is released from risk under the guarantee. At December31, 2007, the Companys unamortized balance related to the value of the guarantee was $1,207,500. Under the operating agreement, Del-Tin Fibers employees operate the plant. Deltic has committed to provide a portion of the plants fiber and
wood fuel supply at market prices. During 2007, 2006, and 2005, Deltic sold Del-Tin Fiber approximately $3,772,000, $3,939,000, and $3,868,000, respectively, of these lumber manufacturing by-products. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, the
Company had a receivable from Del-Tin Fiber of $193,000 and $118,000, respectively.

management of Del-Tin Fiber has performed evaluations of possible impairment of the long-lived assets of the plant in accordance with SFAS 121 and/or SFAS 144, as applicable. To date, these analyses have indicated that no impairment exists at the
Del-Tin Fiber level.

29,620 Note 9 Credit Facilities On September9, 2005, the Company entered into an agreement with SunTrust Bank and other banks which provided an unsecured and committed revolving
credit facility totaling $260,000,000, which includes a $50,000,000 letter of credit feature. On August7, 2007, Deltic amended its revolving credit agreement whereby the amount of commitments available under the facility were increased from
$260,000,000 to $300,000,000. Pursuant to the amendment, the term of the revolving credit agreement, subject to other provisions, was extended to September9, 2012; pricing of applicable commitment fees and margins was amended; an option to
request an increase in the amount of aggregate revolving commitments from $300,000,000 to $350,000,000 was reinstated; certain covenants were amended and/or deleted and, provisions that permit inclusion of the pro forma impact of certain
acquisitions in determining compliance by Deltic to applicable terms were added. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, $300,000,000 and $260,000,000, respectively, were available in excess of all borrowings outstanding under or supported by the
respective facilities. Borrowings under the current agreement bear interest at a base rate or an adjusted Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin, depending upon the type of loan the Company executes. The applicable margin component of the
interest rate varies with the type of loan and the Companys total debt to capital ratio. There were no borrowings outstanding at December31, 2007 and 2006. No letters of credit supported by the facility were present at December31,
2007 and 2006. The agreement contains certain restrictive financial covenants, including a leverage ratio of no greater than 65 to 10, minimum timber market value greater than 175 percent of outstanding total senior indebtedness, and a fixed
charge ratio coverage. Fees associated with the current revolving credit facility include a commitment fee of 10 to 25 percent per annum on the unused portion of the committed amount. In addition, the agreement contains restrictive covenants 
61 Table of Contents DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2007 Note 9 Credit Facilities cont.
including limitations on the incurrence of debt; a minimum consolidated net worth of the sum of $165,000,000, plus 50 percent of cumulative consolidated net
income from April1, 2005, and a maximum leverage ratio of 6 to 1. The Company incurred aggregate costs of $1,252,000 related to the securing of the current facility, which were deferred and are being amortized as additional interest expense
over the term of the agreement. The Company may also borrow up to $1,000,000 under a short-term credit facility with BancorpSouth. The
agreement expires December15, 2008, with renewal annually. The amount available to the Company under this facility is reduced by any borrowings by Deltic. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, Deltic had no borrowings outstanding under this
line of credit, resulting in $1,000,000 available to the Company. Borrowings bear interest based upon the New York Prime. Deltic also has an agreement with BancorpSouth which provides a $2,000,000 letter of credit facility. Amounts available to the
Company under the facility are reduced by any letters of credit issued on behalf of the Company. Outstanding letters of credit as of December31, 2007 and 2006 were $357,000 and $235,000, respectively, which left $1,643,000 in 2007 and
$1,765,000 in 2006, available to Deltic. In addition, Deltic has an agreement with Regions Bank which provides a $1,000,000 letter of
credit facility. The agreement expires in 2010. Amounts available to Deltic under the facility are reduced by any letters of credit issued on behalf of the Company. Outstanding letters of credit as of December31, 2006 was $22,000, resulting in
$978,000 at December31, 2006 being available to the Company, while there were no outstanding letters of credit at December31, 2007, and the entire $1,000,000 was available. For additional information regarding these financial
instruments, see Note 13 Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Note 10 Indebtedness The Companys indebtedness at December31 consisted of the following:  Thousands of dollars

At the end of 2007, the Company had no balance due on the notes payable under the Companys revolving credit facility agreement with
SunTrust Bank and a group of other banks. This agreement will expire on September9, 2012. During 1998, the Company successfully
completed negotiation of the private placement of $40,000,000 of Series A Senior Notes Notes with Pacific Coast Farm Credit, a division of American AgCredit. On March30, 2007, the Company entered into an agreement with American
AgCredit PCA to amend and restate the terms of the Notes. Under the new agreement the Notes are due and payable December18, 2016. Prior to said agreement, such Notes would have become due on December18, 2008, pursuant to a Note Purchase
Agreement effective December18, 1998. The interest rate for the Notes remains the same as under the 1998 agreement 666 percent through December18, 2008, and after such date the interest rate is reduced to 610 percent for the balance
of the term of the Notes. No installment payments are required, but the terms allow for prepayments at the option of

the Company. The agreement contains certain restrictive financial covenants, including a minimum consolidated net worth of the sum of $175,567,000, plus 50
percent of consolidated net income accrued during each quarter thereafter commencing after December31, 2006, plus 100 percent of the net proceeds from any public or private offering of common or preferred stock of the company, a maximum funded
debt/capitalization ratio of 6 to 1, a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 25 to 1, and to maintain a timber market value greater than 200 percent of outstanding total senior indebtedness. The Company incurred $226,000 of costs related to
the issuance of these notes, which were deferred and are being amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. An additional $75,000 was incurred at the time of the amendment and is being amortized as additional
interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt. In anticipation of issuance of these notes, the Company entered into and settled an interest rate hedge contract. Upon settlement of this contract in December 1998, the Company paid
$1,081,000, which was deferred and is being amortized as other debt expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate for these notes of approximately 69 percent. On December20, 2002, Deltic successfully completed the private placement of $30,000,000 of senior notes with Metropolitan Life and a group of other
domestic insurance companies. These unsecured notes have a Fixed stated interest rate of 601 percent and ultimately mature on December20, 2012. Semiannual installments of $3,333,000, or such lesser amount as shall be outstanding, are required
beginning on December20, 2008. The note terms allow for prepayment at the option of the Company in an amount of not less than five percent of the principal amount outstanding at the time of any prepayment. The agreement contains certain
restrictive financial covenants, including a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of the sum of $148,299,000, plus 25 percent of cumulative consolidated adjusted net income from July1, 2002, and a maximum consolidated debt to consolidated
net capitalization ratio of 6 to 1. The Company incurred $179,000 of costs related to the issuance of these notes, which were deferred and are being amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. The scheduled maturities of long-term debt for the next five years are $3,333,000 in 2008, $6,667,000 in 2009, $6,667,000 in 2010, $6,667,000 in 2011, and
$6,666,000 in 2012. For additional information regarding financial instruments, see Note 9 Credit Facilities and Note 13 Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Note 11 Income Taxes The components of income tax expense/benefit related to income from

Short-term deferred tax assets of $1,545,000 and $1,654,000 at December31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, are included in the consolidated balance sheets in prepaid expenses and other current assets for the respective years. In
assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, Deltics management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the Companys total deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of
these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future
taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are anticipated to reverse,
management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets at December31, 2007, as reductions of future taxable income or by utilizing available tax planning strategies. However, the
amount of the net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if estimates of taxable income are revised. In 2005, the Company reduced its valuation allowance to zero based on current projections of increased future
taxable income. The net change in the valuation allowances was a decrease of $2,612,000 in 2005 and was principally due to changes in potential use or expiration of net operating losses for state tax purposes. As of March31, 2007, the Company
had utilized the benefits of these state net operating losses in their entirety. At December31, 2005, the Company had operating loss
carryforwards for state tax purposes of approximately $31,546,000. At December31, 2006 the Company had prepaid federal and state income taxes totaling $44,000 reflected in the consolidated balance sheet in prepaid expenses and other current
assets. At December31, 2007, the Company had a federal and state income tax liability of $1,371,000 and $433,000 in related federal benefit in deferred charges and other assets. Upon the initial adoption of FIN 48, the Company recorded a net
cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January1, 2007 which increased retained earnings by $524,000 as of such date primarily related to certain previously unrecognized tax benefits that did not meet the criteria for
recognition upon adoption of FIN 48. The Company is no longer subject to federal and state income tax examination by tax authorities for
years before 2004. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits excluding both interest and any
related federal benefits is as follows:  Thousands of dollars Balance at January1, 2007 230 Increases related to current year tax positions 1,236 Lapse of statute 84 Balance at December31, 2007 1,382 If the Company were to prevail on all unrecognized tax benefits recorded on the balance sheet,
approximately $942,000 would benefit the effective tax rate. Depending upon examinations by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations, it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions
previously taken may decrease by up to $1,284,000 within the next twelve months. The actual amount of such decrease, if any, will depend on several future developments and events, many of which are outside our control. The amount included in current
taxes payable for state uncertain tax positions may be reclassified to a long-term item in the subsequent year. The Companys policy is to recognize

interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in other expenses. During the year ended December31, 2007, the
Company recognized approximately $2,700 in interest expense from these items. The Company had approximately $42,000 accrued in deferred revenue and other accrued liabilities for interest and penalties at December31, 2007. Note 12 Stockholders Rights Plan The Company
has a Stockholders Rights Plan Rights Plan, which provides for each eligible common shareholder to receive a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right Right for each outstanding share of the Companys common
stock held. On October19, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors amended the Rights Plan to, among other items, extend its term to December31, 2016, and to increase the exercise price of the rights to $200 per share. The Rights will
detach from the common stock and become exercisable: 1following a specified period of time after the date of the first public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons Acquiring Person, has become
the beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of the Companys common stock or 2following a specified amount of time of the commencement of a tender or exchange offer by any Acquiring Person, which would, if consummated, result in such
persons becoming the beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of the Companys common stock. In either case, the detachment of the Rights from the common stock is subject to extension by a majority of the directors of the Company. The Rights have
certain anti-takeover effects and will cause substantial dilution to any Acquiring Person that attempts to acquire the Company without conditioning the offer on a substantial number of Rights being acquired. The Rights are not intended to prevent a
takeover, but rather are designed to enhance the ability of the Board of Directors of the Company to negotiate with an acquiror on behalf of all the shareholders. Other terms of the Rights are set forth in, and the foregoing description is qualified
in its entirety by, the Rights Agreement between the Company and Harris N.A. formerly known as Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as Rights Agent. Note
13 Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial
instruments held by the Company at December31, 2007 and 2006. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. The table excludes financial
instruments included in current assets and liabilities, except current maturities of long-term debt, all of which have fair values approximating carrying values.  2007 2006 Thousands of dollars

66 Table of Contents DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2007 Note 14 Concentration of Credit
Risks 
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to credit risk are trade accounts
receivable. These receivables normally arise from the sale of wood products and real estate. Concentration of credit with respect to these trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers comprising the Companys
customer base. No single recurring customer accounted for a significant amount of the Companys sales of wood products or real estate in 2007, 2006, or 2005. At December31, 2007 and 2006, there was no significant accounts receivable from
a single customer. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral to support accounts receivable. Note 15 Employee and Retiree Benefit Plans The Company has both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit
retirement plans that cover the majority of its employees. The plans provide defined benefits based on years of service and final average salary. Deltic also has other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all of its employees. The
health care plan is contributory with participants contributions adjusted as needed. The life insurance plan is noncontributory. The Company uses a September30 measurement date for its plans.  FundedQualifiedRetirementPlan  OtherPostretirementPlans Thousands of dollars

be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $22,000 and $51,000, respectively. The estimated net loss and plan amendment for the other defined benefit postretirement plans
that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $35,000 and $199,000, respectively. The discount rate assumption used by the Company to measure benefit obligations and net periodic expenses is based on the estimated interest rate at which the benefit obligations of its plans can be settled. In
determining the discount rate as of the measurement date of its plans for 2006 and 2005, the Company considered corporate bonds with ratings of AAA or AA, which are deemed high quality, as well as the general level of interest rates since the last
measurement date. For 2007, the Company used a discount rate durational study of OPEB liabilities to determine an appropriate discount rate. To develop the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption, the Company considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated
with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted, based on the target asset association, to develop the expected
long-term rate of return on asset assumption for the portfolio. The returns were adjusted to account for plan expenses. This resulted in the selection of the 750 percent assumption. Retirement Plans The accumulated benefit obligation for the Companys retirement plans were $20,670,000 at
December31, 2007 and $20,197,000 at December31, 2006. For the Companys qualified plan, the projected benefit obligation PBO exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $2,843,000 and $6,402,000 at December31, 2007
and 2006, respectively. The Company does not fund its nonqualified plan; therefore, this plan has no assets. The PBO for this nonqualified plan was $3,049,000 at year-end 2007 and $3,187,000 at year-end 2006.

The weighted average asset allocation for the Companys qualified retirement plan at
December31, 2007 and 2006, by asset category, consisted of the following:  2007TargetAllocation
2007 2006TargetAllocation
2006 Equity securities
45-65 68 45-65 69 Debt securities including cash equivalents
35-55 32 35-55 31 100 100 Equity securities generally consist of common stocks. Investments in debt securities are limited
to U.S. government securities and high quality corporate bonds. Cash equivalents are limited to U.S. government obligations. The primary
investment goals are: 1preservation of principle, 2investment in a balanced portfolio, and 3growth of assets to exceed inflation. To meet these goals, the Companys Investment Committee has adopted the above target asset
allocation ranges as outlined in the investment policy for the qualified retirement plan. These ranges allow for flexibility to meet investment goals without exposing the plans assets to excessive risk. The current funding status of the qualified retirement plan is expected to require the Company to make a contribution during 2008 of $896,000. Deltic
expects to contribute $225,000 in 2008 to fund benefits to be paid from its nonqualified retirement plan. Estimated benefits to be paid from the retirement plans amount to $860,000 in 2008; $915,000 in 2009; $961,000 in 2010; $1,032,000 in 2011 1,143,000 in 2012; and $7,453,000 in the period 2013 through 2017. Other Postretirement Benefits The
Company sponsors a plan that provides comprehensive health care benefits supplementing Medicare benefits for those eligible and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Costs are accrued for this plan during the service lives of covered
employees. Retirees contribute a portion of the self-funded cost of health care benefits and the Company contributes the remainder. The Company pays premiums for life insurance coverage arranged through an insurance company. The health care plan is
funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. The Company retains the right to modify or terminate the benefits and/or cost sharing provisions. During
the third quarter of 2004, Deltic applied the effect of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 to its obligation under the Companys other postretirement benefits plan. The prescription drug benefits offered
by the Companys plan were determined to be at least actuarially equivalent to those provided with the Act, which qualifies the plan to receive federal subsidy payments under Medicare Part D. Estimated benefit payments to be paid by the Company
for other postretirement benefits, net of the expected Medicare Part D subsidy, amount to $470,000 in 2008; $504,000 in 2009; $560,000 in 2010; $567,000 in 2011; $574,000 in 2012; and $3,169,000 in the period 2013 through 2017. The Company expects
to contribute approximately $470,000 to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2008. Effective January1, 2007, Deltic no longer offers prescription drug coverage under its other postretirement benefits plan to post-65 retirees.

Benefit Plans cont. 
In determining the benefit obligation for health care at December31, 2007, health care
inflation cost was assumed to increase at an annual rate of eight percent in 2008, then decreasing one percent per year to an ultimate cost trend rate of five percent in 2011. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the
amounts reported for the health care plan. A one percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend would increase the aggregate service and interest cost components of periodic benefit cost for 2007 by $105,000 and the benefit
obligation by $901,000, while a one percentage-point decrease in the assumed rate would decrease the 2007 cost components by $86,000 and the benefit obligation by $761,000. The Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Post Retirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statement No87, 88, 106 and 132 R as of December31, 2006, which require that the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans be fully recognized in
the balance sheet.

Thrift Plan Employees of the Company may participate in its thrift plan by allotting up to a specific percentage of their
base pay. The Company matches contributions at a stated percentage of each employees allotment. Company contributions to this plan were $588,730 in 2007, $653,000 in 2006, and $625,000 in 2005.

Note 16 Incentive Plans Stock Incentive Plan On April25, 2002, the Companys shareholders approved the Deltic
Timber Corporation 2002 Stock Incentive Plan the 2002 Plan. The 2002 Plan replaced the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan the 1996 Plan, which was terminated. At December31, 2007, remaining outstanding options under the 1996
Plan totaled 25,179 shares, all of which were exercisable. Outstanding options under the 1996 Plan will expire from 2008 to 2011 if not exercised and have an average exercise price of $2523 based on the fair market value at date of grant.
The 2002 Plan permits annual awards of shares of the Companys common stock to executives, other key employees, and nonemployee
directors. Under the plan, the Executive Compensation Committee the Committee is authorized to grant: 1stock options; 2restricted stock and restricted stock units; 3performance units; and 4other
stock-based awards, including stock appreciation rights and rights to dividends and dividend equivalents. The number of shares available for issuance under the 2002 Plan is 1,800,000 shares unless adjustment is determined necessary by the Committee
as the result of dividend or other distribution, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of common stock, or other corporate transaction in
order to prevent dilution or enlargement of benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available. At December31, 2007, 1,282,848 of these 1,800,000 shares were available for award under the 2002 Plan. No participant in the 2002 Plan
may receive options and stock appreciation rights in any calendar-year that relates to more than 50,000 shares, and the maximum number of shares which may be awarded as restricted stock and restricted stock units or other stock-based awards is
180,000 shares. The Company has a policy of issuing treasury stock to satisfy all share-based incentive plans. The cost of stock-based compensation is reflected in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of income and
amounted to $2,676,000 in 2007, $1,207,000 in 2006, and $1,179,000 in 2005. For additional information regarding the Companys stock-based compensation, including the effect on net income/loss and earnings per share if the Company had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 Rfor 2005, see Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies. Stock Options For each option granted under the 2002 Plan, the Committee fixes the option price at not less than fair market value on the date of the grant and the option term, not to exceed 10 years from date of grant. The
resulting fixed stock-based compensation cost was recognized over the vesting period for these options. New options granted in 1997 and 1998 were for ten years and primarily incentive. Options granted since 1998 have been for ten years and
nonqualified. All outstanding options have an option price not less than the market value on the grant date, with a range in option prices of $220625 to $5375 per share. For options granted in 1997, exclusive of replacement options, one-half could
be exercised or surrendered after two years and the remainder after three years. For options granted from 1998 through 2001, one-half could be exercised or surrendered after one year and the remainder after three years. During 2003, the Company
granted options for 129,750 shares. For 121,750 shares granted in 2003, one-half could be exercised or surrendered after one year and the remainder after three years. The remaining 8,000 shares awarded to nonemployee directors at an option price of
$2431 in 2003, were vested immediately when awarded. During 2004, the Company granted options for 39,687 shares, at an option price of $32565, one-fourth may be exercised or surrendered after each one-year period over the subsequent four years
from issuance. The Company granted options for 36,160 shares in 2005 at an option price of $44355, one-fourth may be exercised or surrendered after each one-year period over the subsequent four years from issuance. The Company granted options for
30,956 shares in 2006 at an option price of

During 2007 two executives retired. The Company compensation committee granted them a modification in
their employment continuation requirement. The Company recognized incremental stock-based compensation expense of $1,076,000 for restricted stock awards and $177,000 for stock options in 2007 related to the modification of these awards. 
Other Stock-based Awards The Committee may also grant other awards, including but not limited to, stock appreciation
rights and rights to dividends and dividend equivalents that are denominated, or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to shares of the Companys common stock, including securities convertible
in its common stock, as deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purpose of the 2002 Plan. No such other stock-based awards have been granted. Incentive Compensation Plan Cash Awards The Company has an incentive
compensation plan that provides for annual cash awards to officers and key employees based on actual results for a year compared to objectives established by the Executive Compensation Committee, which administers the Plan, at the beginning of that
year. The Company recorded expenses for cash incentive awards of $825,000, $928,000, and $1,571,000, in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The Company had accrued provisions for cash incentive awards totaling $852,000 and $900,000 at
December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in deferred revenues and other accrued liabilities. Note 17

Note 19 Staff Accounting Bulletin No108 As discussed in Note 1 Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements, the SEC released SAB 108 in September 2006. After the issuance of SAB 108, the
Company began a review of all accounting practices. Historically, the Company had accumulated and quantified misstatements under the roll-over method. This method focused primarily on the impact of any misstatement, including the
reversal of prior-year misstatements, on the current-year consolidated income statement. As directed under SAB 108, the Company must now evaluate misstatements under a dual approach method, which also required quantification under the
iron curtain method. The iron curtain method requires the Company to quantify the effect of correcting the period-end balance sheet. The transition provisions of SAB 108 permit the Company to adjust for the cumulative effect on retained earnings of accumulated misstatements relating to prior years. SAB 108 also requires the adjustment of any prior
quarterly financial statements within the fiscal year of adoption for the effects of such errors on the quarters when the information is next presented. Such adjustments do not require previously filed reports with the SEC to be amended. Effective
for the fiscal year ended December31, 2006, the Company adopted SAB 108. In accordance with SAB 108, the Company has adjusted beginning retained earnings for fiscal 2006 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the items
described below. The Company considers these adjustments to be immaterial to prior period income statements. Prior to SAB 108, the Company
only capitalized interest for qualifying assets constructed or otherwise produced for which interest on directly associated debt was incurred. Capitalized interest was then added to the cost of the underlying assets and was

amortized accordingly. Potential uncapitalized interest and any amortization expense in any one year were deemed immaterial by management. In reaching that determination, the following quantitative measures were considered:  Year
ReportedNetIncome/Loss Percent ofReportedNetIncome/Loss 2005 28,000 14,518,000 019 2004 158,000 11,093,000 142 2003 93,000 8,194,000 114 2002 463,000 13,881,000 334 1997-2001 1,211,000 59,505,000 204 The application of SAB 108s dual approach regarding capitalized interest resulted in a
cumulative effect on the balance sheet that was deemed to be material. The effect of the Companys historical practices resulted in the Company under reporting capitalized interest of $7,901,000 and under reporting cost of sales of $4,993,000.
The cumulative effect resulted in an increase in the Companys investment in real estate held for development and sale in the amount of $2,908,000, an increase in deferred income taxes payable amounting to $1,141,000, and an increase in
retained earnings of $1,767,000 at January1, 2006, on the accompanying 2006 consolidated balance sheet. The effect on the Companys 2006 consolidated statement of income was capitalized interest of $1,184,000 and an increase to cost of
sales of $264,000. During the review process for applying SAB 108, the Company identified some misstatements to the prior years
financial statements. Even though these misstatements were immaterial under the dual approach method, the Company chose to include them in its SAB 108 adjustment to the January1, 2006, balance sheet for accuracy. These immaterial misstatements
are listed below. The Companys accounting policy for amortizing deferred charges was not consistent with GAAP. The cumulative effect
for correcting the amortization policy was an increase in deferred charges of $103,000, an increase in deferred income taxes payable amounting to $40,000, and an increase in retained earnings of $63,000 at January1, 2006, on the accompanying
2006 consolidated balance sheet. The Companys accounting policies for accruing certain of its other accrued liabilities were not
consistent with GAAP. The cumulative effect for correcting these policies was an increase in other accrued liabilities of $591,000, a decrease in deferred income taxes payable amounting to $232,000, and a decrease in retained earnings of $359,000 at
January1, 2006, on the accompanying 2006 consolidated balance sheet. Note 20 Business Interruption and Involuntary Conversion
On August9, 2007, the Company experienced a fire in the planer section of its operating facility in Waldo, Arkansas that injured
three individuals and caused operations to temporarily cease. The Company was adequately insured under its workers compensation policy for the personal injury of the three individuals. The Waldo facility became fully operational in late October
2007. The Company maintains business interruption insurance coverage. The Company received cash business interruption proceeds from its
insurance carrier of $3,352,000. The Company recorded $2,166,000 of direct expenses normally included in cost of sales, and $1,186,000 was recorded as other operating income from business interruption insurance proceeds in the Companys
consolidated statement of income.

and Involuntary Conversion cont. 
The Company had adequate property damage insurance coverage to enable it to recover the replacement
cost of its property and equipment that was destroyed by the fire. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company received cash proceeds of $2,475,000 for property damage, including $484,000 for contents and repair cost, and $1,991,000 for
replacement cost of a new planer. After a write-off of basis in the amount of $105,000 for the old planer, the Company recognized a gain from the involuntary conversion of assets in the amount of $1,887,000. All of the Companys insurance
proceeds were reinvested to fully restore the Waldo operations. Note 21 Commitments and Contingencies Commitments Commitments for capital expenditures at December31, 2007, were approximately $600,000 for reforestation
and road construction; $1,400,000 for land acquisitions; $185,000 for property, plant, and equipment; and $3,000,000 for investment in real estate held for development and sale. Contingencies The Company has various contingencies related to its investment in Del-Tin Fiber and has either recorded such
contingencies into its financial statements or disclosed the conditions of the contingency as required by SFAS No5, Accounting for Contingencies, and FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of FASB Interpretation No34. For additional information, see Note 4 Investment in
Del-Tin Fiber. On March28, 2007, the Company and Central Arkansas Water CAW, a consolidated waterworks, entered into a
full and complete settlement of a pending condemnation litigation involving 68006 acres of real property located within the watershed of Lake Maumelle in western Pulaski County, Arkansas. Approximately 640 acres were part of the Companys
planned real estate development, The Ridges at Nowlin Creek. The Company will continue to assess the viability of proceeding with the remaining part of its The Ridges of Nowlin Creek planned development. Under the terms of the settlement, CAW has
paid the Company $8,175,000 approximately $12,021 per acre for the land, and granted the Company a 90-year option to repurchase the land for the same amount should CAW determine the land is not needed for watershed protection or if it ceases to
use the land for such purpose. During the three months ended March31, 2007, the Company recorded sales revenues of $8,175,000 and related costs of $675,000 for a net operating gain of $7,500,000 on this transaction. The Company is also involved in other litigation incidental to its business from time to time. Currently, there are no material other legal proceedings
outstanding.

Note 22 Business Segments The Companys four reporting segments consist of Deltics three operating business units and its corporate function. Each reporting entity has a separate management team and infrastructure that offers
different products and/or services. Woodlands operations manage the Companys Southern Pine timberlands located primarily in Arkansas
and northern Louisiana and derive revenue from the harvest of timber from the timberlands in accordance with its harvest plans, and either sells timber to third parties in the domestic market or to the Companys Mills segment for conversion
into lumber. In addition, this segment may, from time to time, identify and sell a portion of its timberland holdings that is either non-strategic to future timberland management activities or has appreciated, due primarily to location, to a level
that exceeds its value as a timber-growing asset. This segment also generates revenue from the leasing of hunting, oil and gas, and other rights on its timberlands. The Mills segment consists of Deltics two sawmills which convert timber, purchased from third parties or the Companys Woodlands segment, into lumber. These mills produce a variety of products, including
dimension lumber, boards, timbers, decking, and secondary manufacturing products, such as finger-jointed studs. These products are sold primarily to wholesale distributors, lumber treaters, and truss manufacturers in the South and Midwest and used
in residential construction, roof trusses and laminated beams. Real Estate operations, which include real estate developments, add value to
former timberland by developing it into upscale, planned residential and commercial developments. These developments, which are generally centered around a core amenity, are being developed in stages. Historically, real estate sales have consisted
primarily of residential lots sold to builders or individuals, commercial site sales, and sales of undeveloped acreage. In addition, this segment currently leases retail and office space to third parties in a retail center constructed by the
Company, and held for sale, in one of its developments. This segment also manages: 1 a real estate brokerage subsidiary which generates commission revenue by reselling existing homes and 2a country club operation, Chenal Country Club,
Inc., around which the Companys Chenal Valley development is centered. This club operation derives its revenues from membership services, food and beverage sales, and membership dues. Corporate operations consist primarily of senior management, accounting, information systems, human resources, purchasing, treasury, income tax, and legal
staff functions that provide support services to the operating business units. The Company currently does not allocate the cost of maintaining these support functions to its operating units. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies. The Company evaluates
the performance of its segments based on operating income before results of: Del-Tin Fiber, an equity method investee; interest income and expense; other nonoperating income or expense; and income taxes. Intersegment revenues consist primarily of
timber sales from the Woodlands segment to the Mills operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders Deltic Timber Corporation:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Deltic Timber Corporation and Subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2007 and
2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2007. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. Also as
discussed in Note 1, effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payment, and Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders Deltic Timber Corporation:
We have audited Deltic Timber Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Deltic Timber Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based
on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Deltic Timber Corporation and Subsidiaries as of
December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2007, and our report dated
March6, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.  s/ KPMG LLP KPMG LLP

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures Deltic Timber Corporation Deltic or the Company has established disclosure controls and
procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify the Companys financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board
of Directors. Based on their evaluation as of December31, 2007, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the
Company have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15f. Under the supervision and with
the participation of management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, Deltic conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, management concluded that
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2007. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Deltics management, with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated any changes in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Companys most recent fiscal quarter the Companys fourth quarter in the case of an annual report, and have concluded that there was no change to Deltics internal
control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Deltics internal control over financial reporting.  Item9B.
