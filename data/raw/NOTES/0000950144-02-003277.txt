ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To SpectRx, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SPECTRX, INC. a
Delaware corporation and subsidiary as of December 31, 2000 and 2001 and the
related statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of SpectRx, Inc. and subsidiary as
of December 31, 2000 and 2001 and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. s/ Arthur Andersen LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 2001
1.    ORGANIZATION AND BACKGROUND
SpectRx, Inc. and subsidiary the Company or SpectRx, each a
Delaware corporation, is a medical technology company developing and
providing products for the diabetes and noninvasive diagnostic markets.
The Company uses its technologies to provide minimally-invasive blood
sampling procedures, insulin delivery products and cancer detection
products. The Company goal is to introduce products that reduce or
eliminate pain, are convenient to use, and provide rapid results at
the point of care, thereby improving patient well-being and reducing
health care costs. The Company products are based upon a variety of
proprietary technologies. The Company infant jaundice product and
products in development for glucose monitoring, diabetes screening and
cancer detection are based upon its proprietary biophotonic
technologies. The technologies employed in its insulin delivery
products, including those under development, are designed to deliver
insulin to people who have diabetes more comfortably and effectively.
The Company has entered into collaborative arrangements with Abbott
Laboratories Abbott, Roche Diagnostics BMC Roche, Respironics,
Inc. Respironics, and Welch Allyn, Inc. Welch Allyn to
facilitate the development, commercialization, and introduction of its
glucose monitoring, diabetes screening, infant jaundice, and cervical
cancer detection products, respectively. On December 31, 2001, the
Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Sterling
Medivations, Inc. Sterling a developer of innovative insulin
delivery products for people with diabetes. The Company intends to
develop and market its insulin products without a collaborative
partner.
The Company has a limited operating history upon which its prospects
can be evaluated. The Company prospects must be considered in light
of the substantial risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by
entrants into the medical device industry. This industry is
characterized by an increasing number of participants, intense
competition and a high failure rate. The Company has experienced
operating losses since its inception, and, as of December 31, 2001, it
has an accumulated deficit of about $393 million. To date, the Company
has engaged primarily in research and development efforts. The Company
first generated revenues from product sales in 1998, but does not have
significant experience in manufacturing, marketing or selling its
products. The Company development efforts may not result in
commercially viable products, and it may not be successful in
introducing its products. Moreover, required regulatory clearances or
approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner, or at all. The
Company products may not ever gain market acceptance, and the Company
may not ever generate significant revenues or achieve profitability.
The development and commercialization of the Company products will
require substantial development, regulatory, sales and marketing,
manufacturing and other expenditures. The Company expects operating
losses to continue through at least 2002 as it continues to expend
substantial resources to complete development of its products, obtain
regulatory clearances or approvals, build its marketing, sales,
manufacturing and finance organizations and conduct further research
and development.
A significant portion of the Company revenues and profits are
expected to be derived from royalties and manufacturing profits that it
will receive from Abbott and Respironics resulting from sales of the
products for which it has collaborative arrangements with each of these
companies and from the insulin delivery products     developed by its subsidiary, Sterling. The royalties and manufacturing
profits that the Company expects to receive from each of its
collaborative partners and from Sterling depend on sales of these
products. The Company markets the majority of its infant jaundice
product directly to distributors. The Company intends to market its
insulin delivery products directly to distributors and other customers.
The Company and its collaborative partners may not be able to sell
sufficient volumes of its products to generate substantial royalties,
distribution profits, and manufacturing profits for the Company.
2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of SpectRx and its subsidiary, Sterling Medivations. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash or cash
equivalents.

INTANGIBLES
Intangible assets include the excess of the purchase price of the
acquisition over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired as well
as various other acquired intangibles. Intangible assets are amortized
over the following estimated useful lives                                        YEARS
Goodwill                             Not applicable
Patents                              13 years
Noncompete and employment agreements               18 months     Goodwill is not subject to amortization but will be subject to a
periodic impairment assessment by applying a fair-value based test.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, the Company evaluates the
carrying value of property and equipment and intangibles in relation to
the operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows of the
underlying business. The Company adjusts the net book value of the
underlying assets if the sum of expected future cash flows is less than
book value. Management believes that the long-lived assets in the
accompanying balance sheets are appropriately valued.
PATENT COSTS
Costs incurred in filing, prosecuting, and maintaining patents are
expensed as incurred. Such costs aggregated approximately $608,000,
$550,000, and $445,000 in 1999, 2000, and 2001.     ACCRUED LIABILITIES
Accrued liabilities are summarized as follows at December 31, 2000 and
2001 in thousands                                               2000        2001

Accrued liabilities                          $ 1,262       $ 1,194
REVENUE RECOGNITION
In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements, the Company records revenue from
product sales at the time the product is shipped or title passes
pursuant to the terms of the agreement with the customer, the amount
due from the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility of
the related receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized
only when we have no significant future performance obligation.
Revenue from collaborative agreements is recorded when milestones have
been met. Periodic license fee payments under collaborative agreements
related to future performance are deferred and recognized as income
when earned.
In July and September 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF
reached a consensus on Issue 00-10, Accounting for Shipping and
Handling Fees and Costs. EITF Issue 00-10 requires that all amounts
billed to a customer in a sale transaction for shipping an handling be
classified as sales and recommends that shipping and handling expenses
be classified as cost of sales. The Company implemented EITF Issue
00-10 during 2001. The adoption of EITF Issue 00-10 did not have a
material impact on the Company results of operations or financial
position.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development expenses consist of non-reimbursed
expenditures for research conducted by the Company and payments made
under contracts with consultants or other outside parties. All research
and development costs are expensed as incurred.
INCOME TAXES
Accounting for Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are determined based on differences between the
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect
when the differences are expected to reverse.
NET LOSS PER SHARE
The calculation and presentation of net loss per share are in
accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per
share are based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of
shares outstanding and the dilutive effect of common stock equivalent
shares CSEs issuable on the conversion of convertible preferred
stock using the if-converted method and stock options and warrants
using the treasury stock method. For all periods     presented, CSEs have been excluded from weighted average shares
outstanding, as their impact was antidilutive.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The book values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and
other financial instruments approximate their fair values principally
because of the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair
value of the Company collaborative partner advance is estimated based
on the current rates offered to the Company for debt of similar terms
and maturities. Under this method, the fair value of the Company
collaborative partner advance was not significantly different than the
stated value at December 31, 2000 and 2001.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income, which establishes new rules for the reporting
and display of comprehensive income and its components; however, the
Company has no other comprehensive income items as defined in SFAS No.
130.
DERIVATIVE INVESTMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, in June
1998, SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities--Deferral of the Effective Date of the FASB Statement No.
133, in June 1999 and SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain hedging Activities--an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 133, in June 2000. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting
and reporting standards for derivatives and hedging. It requires that
all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair
value and establishes specific criteria for the use of hedge
accounting. SFAS No. 137 defers the effective date of SFAS No. 133 by
one year to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS No. 138
amends the accounting and reporting standards of SFAS No. 133 for
certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities. The
Company required adoption date was January 1, 2001. Upon adoption of
the three statements, there was no material impact to its results of
operations or financial position as the Company has no material
derivative instruments.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
The FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Accounting for Business Combinations,
on June 30, 2001. It requires that all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting.
The FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Accounting for Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, on June 30, 2001. It requires that goodwill and
certain intangible assets will no longer be subject to amortization,
but instead will be subject to a periodic impairment assessment by
applying a fair-value based test. The Company required adoption date
is January 1, 2002. Adoption of SFAS No. 142 will not have a material
impact on the Company results of operations or financial position as
substantially all of the Company intangible assets continue to be
subject to amortization.
Additionally, in June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Asset
Retirement Obligations, which establishes new accounting and reporting
standards for legal obligations associated with retiring assets. The
fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation must be
recorded in the period in which it is incurred, with the cost
capitalized as part of the related long-lived assets and depreciated
over the asset useful life. Changes in the liability resulting from
the passage of time will be recognized as operating expenses. SFAS No.
143 must be adopted by 2003 and is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company results of operations or financial position.     In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, which supercedes both
Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, and the accounting and
reporting provisions for the disposal of a segment of a business
contained in APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of
Operations--Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events
and Transactions. SFAS No. 144 establishes a single accounting model
for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale and broadens the
presentation of discontinued operations. The provisions of SFAS No. 144
are effective beginning in 2002 and are not expected to have a material
impact on the Company results of operations or financial position.
RECLASSIFICATION
Certain amounts in the December 31, 1999 and 2000 financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
3.    ACQUISITION
On December 31, 2001, the Company purchased the outstanding shares of
Sterling Medivations. Sterling is a developer of innovative insulin
delivery products for people with diabetes. The acquisition of Sterling
expands the Company diabetes business by adding a portfolio of
FDA-cleared insulin delivery products, including consumables for the
rapidly growing insulin pump market. As a result of the merger, the
Company issued 548,056 shares of Company common stock in exchange for
all of the outstanding Sterling common stock and preferred stock and
reserved 22,024 shares for issuance upon exercise of stock options
assumed in the merger with an estimated fair market value of $61,895
plus 62,282 shares related to cash balances following the merger,
Sterling stockholders and option holders will be entitled to up to an
aggregate of 1,234,567 additional shares of Company common stock in the
future if the Sterling product line achieves specified financial goals.
In connection with the acquisition of Sterling, the Company entered
into employment agreements with four employees for terms expiring June
2003. The excess of the cost over the estimated fair value of net
tangible assets acquired amounts to approximately $41 million and has
been included in intangibles in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. The $41 million purchase price excess has been allocated
between patents and noncompete agreements. In addition, goodwill and a
related deferred tax liability of approximately $16 million have been
recorded to reflect taxable temporary differences existing at December
31, 2001. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase in
accordance with SFAS No. 141, Accounting for Business Combinations.
The Company preliminary estimate of the purchase price allocation
arising from the acquisition is as follows in thousands                                   
Purchase price                        $  4,291

In December 1996, the Company sublicensed certain technology to and
acquired a 65% interest in FluorRx, Inc. FluorRx, a corporation
organized for the purpose of developing and commercializing technology
related to fluorescence spectroscopy. The Company interest in FluorRx
is represented by two seats on the board of directors and 12 million
shares of convertible preferred stock purchased for $250,000. In
December 1997, March 1998, August 1998, and April 1999, FluorRx sold
additional convertible preferred stock for net cash proceeds of
$521,000, $429,000, $511,000, and $300,000, respectively. The issuance
of additional preferred stock reduced the Company ownership on a
converted basis to 43%.
For the year ended December 31, 1997, FluorRx incurred an operating
loss of $632,000 which was fully consolidated as the Company
represented FluorRx sole source of financial support and
substantially all the capital at risk related to investments and
advances from the Company. Beginning with the December 1997 funding and
through the August 1998 funding, the Company consolidated the FluorRx
losses, but with appropriate allocations to the minority shareholders.
FluorRx losses recorded by the Company during fiscal 1998 amounted to
$306,000. Effective with the August 1998 funding, the Company began
accounting for its investment in FluorRx under the equity method of
accounting. In connection with the change in accounting from
consolidation to the equity method, the Company adjusted its investment
in FluorRx to $0, which resulted in a one-time gain of $635,000. The
Company has also suspended recording gains and losses from its
investment in FluorRx. Suspended equity losses gains amounted to
$342,000, $367,000 and $94,000 for the years ended December 31,
1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. At December 31, 2001, the cumulative
suspended equity loss amounted to $1,406,000.     In 1999, 2000, and 2001, the Company paid certain patent maintenance
and minimum royalty costs amounting to $80,000, $226,000, and $235,000,
respectively, related to technology owned by the Company and
sublicensed to FluorRx. These costs have been expensed as paid.
5.    STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
COMMON STOCK
On February 23, 2000, the Company completed a private placement of
400,000 shares of common stock. The shares were sold for $1250 per
share resulting in gross proceeds of $5,000,000. The Company incurred
issuance costs of $197,000 which is presented as a reduction of
proceeds in the accompanying statements of stockholders' equity.
During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company issued 25,880
shares of common stock in satisfaction of minimum royalty payments
amounting to $189,000 related to the Company exclusive rights to
certain licensed technology.
In June 2001, the Company completed two private placements. On June 4,
2001, the Company entered into an agreement with an investor, which
invested about $95 million in SpectRx common stock before transaction
expenses. On June 13, 2001, the Company entered into an agreement with
another investor, which invested about $25 million in SpectRx common
stock before transaction expenses. The financings consisted, in total,
of sales of approximately 19 million shares of common stock and
warrants to purchase 379,127 shares of common stock. Under the terms of
the agreements, each share of common stock was sold at a price of
$6319 per share. The first transaction, funded on June 4, 2001,
involved the private placement of 15 million shares of common stock.
The second transaction, funded on June 13, 2001, involved the private
placement of 395,633 shares of common stock. The combination of these
two transactions resulted in net proceeds to SpectRx of approximately
$112 million after transaction expenses. In addition, the purchasers
of common stock also received warrants to purchase an aggregate of
379,127 shares of common stock for $98874 per share. These warrants
expire on the fifth anniversary of their issuance date. The warrants
are valued at approximately $17 million and are included in additional
paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
In October 2001, the Company issued 126,199 shares of common stock to
Abbott for gross proceeds of $1 million. The issuance of shares of
common stock was associated with a milestone under a program to
commercialize the Company continuous glucose monitoring technology
for people with diabetes.
PREFERRED STOCK
In January 1997, the Company authorized 5,000,000 shares of preferred
stock with a $001 par value. The board of directors has the authority
to issue these shares and to fix dividends, voting and conversion
rights, redemption provisions, liquidation preferences, and other
rights and restrictions.
In November 1999, the board of directors designated 525,000 shares of
the preferred stock as redeemable convertible preferred stock.
Dividends are payable annually in cash or securities at a rate of 6%
per annum. During the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000, and 2001,
the Company paid dividends in the form of redeemable convertible
preferred stock of $14,000, $315,000, and $315,000, respectively.
The preferred shares, together with any accrued but unpaid dividends,
are convertible shares of common stock at a conversion rate equal to
the greater of $939 per share or the average of the closing sales
price for 30 trading days that begin on the 15th trading day prior to
the Company receipt of a conversion notice sent by the holder of
such shares. Also, the shares of preferred stock automatically convert
into shares of common stock on December 31, 2004 at such conversion
rate. The shares of preferred stock are mandatorily redeemable, except
with respect to 100,000 shares, by the Company at $10 per share, plus
accrued but unpaid dividends, beginning on December 31, 2002, if the
Company receives a written notice from the holders of at least a
majority of the shares of preferred stock on or before the later of
September 30, 2002 or 60 days subsequent to the date that the Company
gives notice to the holders of preferred stock of its right to redeem
the shares which notice may not be given prior to June 1, 2002. If
this written election to be mandatorily redeemed is made, one-half
less 100,000 shares of the shares of preferred stock are to be
mandatorily redeemed on December 31, 2002, and the remaining one-half
on or prior to January 31, 2004, if the Company achieves a revenue
goal of $20 million during the year 2003. If the Company does not
achieve this goal, then of such shares of preferred stock outstanding,
one-half must be redeemed prior to January 31, 2004, and the balance
by December 31, 2004. Additionally, the Company has the option to
redeem the shares of any holder at $10 per share, plus accrued and
unpaid dividends, after receiving a notice from such holder electing
to convert such holder shares of preferred stock into common stock.
The preferred stock also has a liquidation of $10 per share, plus all
accrued but unpaid dividends.     In November 1999, Abbott subscribed to 525,000 shares of Redeemable
Convertible Preferred Stock for consideration of $5,250,000 of which
$2,750,000 was received in November 1999 and $2,500,000 was received in
January 2000.
In September 2001, the Company entered into an agreement with Abbott
whereby Abbott waived its right to redeem 100,000 shares of its
Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock plus the related accrued but
unpaid dividends.
TREASURY STOCK
In September 2001, the Company board of directors approved a stock
repurchase program whereby the Company can purchase up to $10 million
of its common stock. As of December 31, 2001, the Company has purchased
6,700 shares of common stock at an average price of $566 per share.
STOCK OPTIONS
In May 1995, the Company adopted the 1995 Stock Plan the Plan as
amended, under which 1,428,572 shares of common stock are authorized
and reserved for use in the Plan. During the year ended December 31,
2000, the Company board of directors amended the Plan by increasing
the number of shares authorized and reserved for use in the Plan by
500,000 shares of common stock. The Plan allows the issuance of
incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, and stock purchase
rights. The exercise price of options is determined by the Company
board of directors, but incentive stock options must be granted at an
exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company common
stock as of the grant date. Options generally become exercisable over
four years and expire ten years from the date of grant. At December 31,
2001, options to purchase 285,063 shares of common stock were available
for future grant under the Plan.     Stock option activity for each of the three years ended December 31,
2001 is as follows                                                    WEIGHTED

In June 1996, November 1996, and December 1996, the Company granted
options to purchase 269,652, 8,573, and 60,715, respectively, shares of
common stock at exercise prices of $70, $245, and $245 per share,
respectively. In connection with the issuance of these options, the
Company recognized $304,000 as deferred compensation for the excess of
the deemed value for accounting purposes of the common stock issuable
upon exercise of such options over the aggregate exercise price of such
options. This deferred compensation is amortized ratably over the
vesting period of the options.     In December 2001, as a result of the acquisition of Sterling
Medivations, the Company granted options to purchase 22,024 shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $729 per share in exchange for
all the outstanding options, vested and unvested, of Sterling.
The Company has elected to account for its stock-based compensation
plan under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for

LITIGATION AND CLAIMS
The Company has been subject to certain asserted and unasserted claims,
as described below, against certain intellectual property rights owned
and licensed by the Company. A successful claim against intellectual
property rights owned or licensed by the Company could subject the
Company to significant liabilities to third parties, require the
Company to seek licenses from third parties, or prevent the Company
from selling its products in certain markets or at all. In the opinion
of management, there are no known claims against the Company owned or
licensed intellectual property rights that will have a material adverse
impact on the Company financial position or results of operations.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
In March 2000, the Company filed a Demand for Arbitration of certain
disputes arising under its License Agreement with Altea/NIMCO and a
former officer-employee of SpectRx who is also a principal in
Altea/NIMCO. The Company sought an interpretation of certain portions
of the License Agreement relating to the Company obligation to assign
future intellectual property rights and seek relief for these and other
issues. The Company also asked for damages related to these and other
issues. Altea had sent two letters to the Company purporting to give
notice of material breach of the License Agreement for Failure to
assign certain intellectual property rights to Altea or NIMCO and to
participate in a joint development program and other items. Final
arguments were held October 23, 2000 and a decision was entered on
November 7, 2000 and the Arbitration panel denied the claims for
damages by both parties. The panel also denied the claims by
Altea/NIMCO that SpectRx is required to continue a program of Joint
Development and all claims that SpectRx has breached the License and
Joint Development Agreement. The panel examined the scope of Joint
Technology under the Agreement and held that the two patent
applications at issue should be jointly assigned to Altea. The Panel
also resolved a dispute over stock options in effect at the time
Altea/NIMCO principal Jonathan Eppstein employment ended at SpectRx.
The Panel also denied the claims of both sides for attorney fees and
expenses of arbitration.
In December 2000, Altea/NIMCO filed a new Demand for Arbitration of
certain disputes arising under the licensing agreement with SpectRx.
Altea/NIMCO sought a decision requiring SpectRx to jointly assign
certain patents and patent applications to Altea, holding SpectRx
liable for alleged misconduct by a subcontractor, declaring that
SpectRx was required to engage in joint development with Altea, and
declaring that SpectRx had not achieved commercialization under the
licensing agreement. Near the end of 2001, the parties resolved the
dispute by agreeing to amend the licensing agreement and dismiss the
arbitration. The amended licensing agreement released and discharged
each of the parties from any and all claims of any nature arising
before December 30, 2001 of which the parties had knowledge as of
December 30, 2001. Although ownership rights in and to a limited number
of patents and patent applications remained in dispute following the
execution of the amended licensing agreement, the parties subsequently
resolved all such disputes informally.
In August 2000, SpectRx filed a complaint for Declaratory Judgment
against Ampersand Medical Corp. Ampersand seeking a declaration
that SpectRx has not misappropriated or improperly disclosed any
alleged confidential information or alleged trade secrets disclosed to
it by Ampersand. Ampersand subsequently filed a counter-suit in
Illinois against SpectRx alleging that SpectRx had misappropriated
trade secrets belonging to Ampersand. The parties announced that they
had agreed to a settlement on February 1, 2002, releasing the parties
from all claims.     GRANT
In October 2000 and September 2001, the Company received grants of
$307,000 and $338,000, respectively, from the Center for Disease
Control and Prevention CDC to adapt its glucose monitoring
technology to monitor blood sugar levels of children and elderly people
with diabetes. The funding will be used to conduct clinical studies,
research ergonomic issues and to assist in developing a plan for
regulatory approval of the technology for children and the elderly. The
grant announcement represents a commitment of more than $938,000 in
funding to date from the CDC. The Company also received a grant from
the National Cancer Institute for $130,000 in July 2001 for the
Company cervical cancer program.
8.    RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
