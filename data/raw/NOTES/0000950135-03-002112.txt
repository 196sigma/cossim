ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
MKS Instruments, Inc.   In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the
consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under a1 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MKS
Instruments, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001 and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion,
based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the financial statement
schedule listed in the index appearing under a2 presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. The
consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to the merger of
Applied Science and Technology, Inc. on January 26, 2001 in a transaction
accounted for as a pooling of interests, as described in Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements. We did not audit the financial statements and
financial statement schedule of Applied Science and Technology, Inc., which
statements reflect net sales of 30 percent of the related consolidated net sales
for the year ended December 31, 2000. Those statements and schedule were audited
by other auditors whose report thereon has been furnished to us, and our opinion
expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Applied
Science and Technology, Inc., is based solely on the report of the other
auditors. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of
other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible
assets upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets on January 1, 2002. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
MKS Instruments, Inc. was founded in 1961. MKS Instruments, Inc. is a
leading worldwide provider of instruments, components and subsystems that
measure, control, power and monitor critical parameters of semiconductor and
other advanced manufacturing process environments.
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation. On January 26, 2001, MKS Instruments, Inc. completed its
acquisition of Applied Science and Technology, Inc. ASTeX in a transaction
accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting and,
accordingly, the consolidated financial statements reflect the combined
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of MKS Instruments,
Inc., ASTeX and their subsidiaries together, the Company or MKS, for all
periods presented. These consolidated financial statements combine the
historical consolidated financial statements of the Company for all periods
presented and the ASTeX share information has been converted to the MKS share
equivalent.
The fiscal year of MKS ends on December 31. The fiscal year of ASTeX for
the period prior to the acquisition ended on July 1, 2000.
The historical periods combined giving effect to the merger are the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2000 for MKS, and the fiscal year ended July 1, 2000 for
ASTeX.
As a result of conforming dissimilar fiscal year-ends, the ASTeX results of
operations for the six month period ended December 31, 2000 are excluded from
these consolidated financial statements. The following is information related to
the ASTeX financial results for the six-month period ended December 31, 2000                               
Net   $89,193

Decrease in cash and cash   3,142   The excluded net income and excluded decrease in cash and cash equivalents
of $5,968,000 and $3,142,000 have been recorded as adjustments to retained
earnings and statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2001,
respectively.
The following table shows the separate historical results of MKS and ASTeX
for the period prior to the consummation of the merger of the two entities,
included in the reported results for the year ended December 31, 2000.                                FISCAL YEAR ENDED

accounting method. For the year ended December 31                     40
MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
TABLES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
2001, the Company expensed approximately $77 million of merger related
expenses, consisting of $69 million of investment banking, legal, accounting,
printing and other professional fees, and $08 million of regulatory and other
costs.
NET INCOME PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding, and diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common
equivalent shares outstanding. The dilutive effect of options is determined
under the treasury stock method using the average market price for the period.
Common equivalent shares are included in the per share calculations when the
effect of their inclusion would be dilutive.
The following is a reconciliation of basic to diluted net income per share                          FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
2002      2001     2000

Net income loss per common
share --  $   079 $   083 $   174
Net income loss per common
share --  $   079 $   083 $   167   For purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, weighted average
common share equivalents do not include stock options with an exercise price
greater than the average market price of the common shares during the period.
Options to purchase 474,000 shares of common stock were outstanding during 2000,
but were not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share
because the option price was greater than the average market price of the common
shares during the period. Options outstanding during the years ended December
31, 2002 of 8,284,693 and 2001 of 5,958,735 are excluded from the calculation of
diluted net loss per common share because their inclusion would be
anti-dilutive.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations in
accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. Accordingly, no accounting
recognition is given to stock options granted at fair market value until they
are exercised. Upon exercise, net proceeds, including tax benefits realized, are
credited to stockholders' equity.
In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for

The weighted average fair value of options at the date of grant was
estimated using the Black-Scholes model and was $1422 with the following
assumptions in 2002: expected life of 5 years, weighted average interest rate of
391%, expected volatility of 81%, and no dividend yield. In 2001, the weighted
average fair value of options at the date of grant was $1465, with the
following assumptions: expected life of 5 years, weighted average interest rate
of 427%, expected volatility of 83%, and no dividend yield. In 2000, the
weighted average fair value of MKS options at the date of grant was $2274, with
the following assumptions: expected life of 5 years, weighted average interest
rate of 637%, expected volatility of 88%, and no dividend yield.
The fair value of purchase rights granted in 2002, 2001 and 2000 under the
Purchase Plan was $935, $719 and $764, respectively. The fair value of the
employees' purchase rights was estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the
following assumptions in 2002: expected life of 6 months, interest rate of
188%, expected volatility of 81%, and no dividend yield. In 2001, the following
assumptions were made: expected life of 6 months, interest rate of 503 expected volatility of 83%, and no dividend yield. In 2000, the following
assumptions were made: expected life of 6 months, interest rate of 557 expected volatility of 88%, and no dividend yield.
The weighted average fair value of ASTeX options granted during fiscal 2000
was $1853. The fair value of each ASTeX option grant was estimated on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions used for grants issued in fiscal 2000: no dividend
yield; expected volatility of 72%; risk-free interest rate of 592%; and
expected life of 4 years.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE
The functional currency of the majority of the Company foreign
subsidiaries is the applicable local currency. For those subsidiaries, assets
and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates.

Income and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rates
prevailing for the year. The resulting translation adjustments are included in
accumulated other comprehensive income in consolidated stockholders' equity.
Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses were not material in 2002, 2001
and 2000.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue from product sales is recorded upon transfer of title and risk of
loss to the customer provided that there is evidence of an arrangement, the
sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable
is reasonably assured. The Company has no obligations to customers after the
date products are shipped other than pursuant to warranty obligations. The
Company provides for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty
obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue. Shipping and handling
fees, if any, billed to customers are recognized as revenue. The related
shipping and handling costs are recognized in cost of sales. Accounts receivable
allowances include sales returns and bad debt allowances. The Company monitors
and tracks the amount of product returns and reduces revenue at the time of
shipment for the estimated amount of such future returns, based on historical
experience. The Company makes estimates evaluating its allowance for doubtful
accounts. The Company continuously monitors collections and payments from its
customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon its
historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that it has
identified.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS
All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or
less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.

The appropriate classification of investments in securities is determined
at the time of purchase. Debt securities that the Company does not have the
intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as available-for-sale
and are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on securities
classified as available-for-sale are included in accumulated other comprehensive
income in consolidated stockholders' equity. Gross unrealized gains and losses
on available-for-sale investments were not material at December 31, 2002 and
2001. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification
method.
The Company has held investments in companies having operations or
technology in areas within or adjacent to its strategic focus, which are in
non-publicly traded companies whose value is difficult to determine. These
investments are accounted for under the cost and equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method of accounting, which generally applies to investments
that represent a 20 to 50 percent ownership of the equity securities of the
investee, the Company proportionate share of the earnings or losses of the
investee is included in other income and expense. The Company records an
investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a
decline in value. As of December 31, 2002 there were no investments accounted
for under the equity and cost method. As of December 31, 2001 there were
$2,296,000 of investments accounted for under the equity method. This investment
was sold during 2002. The gain on the transaction was not material.
INVENTORIES
The Company values its inventory at the lower of cost first-in, first-out
method or market. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand
and records a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to its
estimated net realizable value, if less than cost, based primarily on its
estimated forecast of product demand.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Equipment acquired under
capital leases is recorded at the present value of the minimum lease payments
required during the lease period. Expenditures for major renewals and
betterments that extend the useful lives of property, plant and equipment are
capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain
or loss is recognized in earnings.
Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of twenty to thirty-one and one-half years for buildings and three
to seven years for machinery and equipment and furniture and fixtures. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated
useful life of the leased asset.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by management based on the
fair value of assets received. These include acquired customer lists,
technology, patents, trade name, and covenants not to compete. Intangible assets
are amortized from three to eight years on a straight-line basis which
represents the estimated periods of benefit.
GOODWILL
Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of acquired net assets exceeded
the fair value of those net assets on the date of acquisition. Through December
31, 2001, the Company amortized goodwill on a straight-line basis over its
expected useful life of 5 to 7 years. As of January 1, 2002, the Company ceased
amortizing goodwill in compliance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142.
The Company assesses goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more
frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded
goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount
of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value,
an impairment loss is recorded equal to that excess.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets which
include acquired amortizable intangible assets, in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144. SFAS 144 requires recognition of
impairment of long-lived assets in the event the net book value of such assets
exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. If an
impairment is indicated, the assets are written down to their estimated fair
value.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The Company
research and development efforts include numerous projects which generally have
a duration of 18 to 30 months.
IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Company values tangible and intangible assets acquired through its
business acquisitions at fair value including in-process research and
development IPR. The Company determines IPR through established
valuation techniques for various projects for the development of new products
and technologies and expenses IPR when technical feasibility is not reached.
ADVERTISING COSTS
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs were not
material in 2002, 2001, and 2000.
INCOME TAXES
The Company records income taxes using the asset and liability method.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income
tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company
evaluates the realizability of its net deferred tax assets and assesses the need
for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. The future benefit to be derived
45
MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
TABLES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
from its deferred tax assets is dependent upon its ability to generate
sufficient future taxable income to realize the assets. The Company records a
valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to the amount that may
be more likely than not to be realized. To the extent the Company establishes a
valuation allowance, an expense will be recorded within the provision for income
taxes line on the statement of income. During the year ended December 31, 2002
the Company established a full valuation allowance for its net deferred tax
assets. In periods subsequent to establishing a valuation allowance, if the
Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its net deferred tax
assets in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation
allowance would be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense in the period
such determination was made. Also in future periods, if the Company were to
determine that it would not be able to realize the recorded amount of its net
deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded
as an increase to income tax expense in the period such determination was made.
The Company does not provide for a U.S. income tax liability on
undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. The earnings of non-U.S.
subsidiaries, which reflect full provision for non-U.S. income taxes, are
indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations or will be remitted substantially
free of additional tax.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Obligations
Associated with the Retirement of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 143. The objective
of SFAS 143 is to provide accounting guidance for legal obligations associated
with the retirement of long-lived assets. The retirement obligations included
within the scope of this pronouncement are those that an entity cannot avoid as
a result of either the acquisition, construction or normal operation of a
long-lived asset. Components of larger systems also fall under this
pronouncement, as well as tangible long-lived assets with indeterminable lives.
The provisions of SFAS 143 are effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The Company is currently evaluating
the expected impact of the adoption of SFAS 143 on the Company financial
condition, cash flows and results of operations. The Company will adopt the
standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.
In June 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146,
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities SFAS 146
was issued. This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for
costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues
Task Force EITF Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. The provisions of SFAS 146 are effective
for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with
early application encouraged. The Company is currently reviewing the provisions
of SFAS 146 to determine the standard impact upon adoption. The Company will
adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.
In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation -- Transition and Disclosure SFAS 148. SFAS 148 provides
alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation as originally
provided by SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
Additionally, SFAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require
prominent disclosure in both the annual and interim financial statements about
the method of accounting for stock-based compensation and the effect of the
method used on reported results. The transitional requirements of SFAS 148 will
be effective for all financial statements for fiscal years ending after December
15, 2002. The disclosure requirements shall be effective for financial reports
containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2002. The Company adopted the provisions of this statement as of
December 31, 2002. The application of this standard did not have a material
impact on the Company consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation FIN No. 45,
Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN No. 45 clarifies that a
guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability
for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The
initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN No. 45 are
applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of FIN No. 45 are applicable for
financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15,
2002, and were adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities. In general, a variable interest entity is a
corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal structure used for business
purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or
b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for
the entity to support its activities. A variable interest entity often holds
financial assets, including loans or receivables, real estate or other property.
Variable interest entities have been commonly referred to as special-purpose
entities or off-balance sheet structures. This Interpretation requires a
variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is
subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity
activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity residual returns or
both. The Company does not expect that this Interpretation will have a material
impact on its financial position or results of operations.
In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on issue 00-21, Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF 00-21 addresses revenue
recognition on arrangements encompassing multiple elements that are delivered at
different points in time, defining criteria that must be met for elements to be
considered to be a separate unit of accounting. If an element is determined to
be a separate unit of accounting, the revenue for the element is recognized at
the time of delivery. EITF 00-21 is effective for revenue arrangements entered
into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company does not
expect that the pronouncement will have a material impact on its financial
position or results of operations.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation
of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an
on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including
those related to revenue recognition, inventory, intangible assets, goodwill,
and other long-lived assets, in-process research and development, merger
expenses, income taxes and investments. Management bases its estimates and
judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to be consistent with the
current year classifications.
3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT
The Company hedges a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated
intercompany sales of inventory, over a maximum period of fifteen months, using
forward exchange contracts and currency options
47
MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
TABLES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
primarily related to Japanese and European currencies. These derivatives are
designated as cash-flow hedges, and changes in their fair value are carried in
accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction affects
earnings. When the hedged transaction affects earnings, the appropriate gain or
loss from the derivative designated as a hedge of the transaction is
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to cost of sales. As of
December 31, 2002 the amount that will be reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income to earnings over the next twelve months is an unrealized
loss of $407,000, net of taxes. The ineffective portion of the derivatives is
primarily related to option premiums, is recorded in cost of sales, and was
immaterial in 2002, 2001, and 2000.
The Company hedges certain intercompany and other payables with foreign
exchange contracts and currency options. Since these derivatives hedge existing
amounts that are denominated in foreign currencies, the derivatives do not
qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133. The foreign exchange gain on
these derivatives was not material in 2002, 2001 and 2000.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on forward exchange contracts and
local currency purchased option contracts that do not qualify for hedge
accounting are recognized immediately in earnings. The cash flows resulting from
forward exchange contracts and local currency purchased options that qualify for
hedge accounting are classified in the statement of cash flows as part of cash
flows from operating activities. Cash flows resulting from forward exchange
contracts and local currency purchased options that do not qualify for hedge
accounting are classified in the statement of cash flows as investing
activities. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments
for trading purposes.
There were forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling
$23,287,000 outstanding at December 31, 2002. Of such forward exchange
contracts, $17,213,000 were outstanding to exchange Japanese yen for US dollars.
There were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2001.
Forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $1,500,000 to exchange
Japanese yen for U.S. dollars were outstanding at December 31, 2000. Local
currency purchased options with notional amounts totaling $5,053,000 11,349,000 and $25,390,000 to exchange foreign currencies for U.S. dollars were
outstanding at December 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Foreign exchange gains on forward exchange contracts which did not qualify
for hedge accounting were immaterial during 2002 and 2000. There were no foreign
exchange gains or losses on forward exchange contracts which did not qualify for
hedge accounting in 2001. Gains and losses on forward exchange contracts and
local currency purchased options that qualify for hedge accounting are
classified in cost of goods sold and totaled a gain of $452,000, $175,000 and
$6,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The fair values of forward exchange contracts at December 31, 2002,
determined by applying period end currency exchange rates to the notional
contract amounts, amounted to an unrealized loss of $407,000. The fair values of
local currency purchased options at December 31, 2002 and 2001, which were
obtained through dealer quotes were immaterial.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
The Company significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally
of cash and cash equivalents, investments, forward exchange contracts, and trade
accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with
financial institutions including the bank it has borrowings with. The Company
maintains investments primarily in U.S. Treasury and government agency
securities and corporate debt securities, rated AA or higher. The Company places
forward currency contracts with high credit-quality financial institutions in
order to minimize credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with
respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of diverse
and geographically dispersed customers. Credit is extended for all customers
based on financial condition and collateral is not required.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The fair value of the term loans, including the current portion,
approximates its carrying value given its variable rate interest provisions. The
fair value of marketable securities is based on quoted market prices. The fair
value of mortgage notes is based on borrowing rates for similar instruments and
approximates its carrying value. For all other balance sheet financial
instruments, the carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short
period to maturity of these instruments.

On October 31, 1995, the Company entered into a term loan agreement with a
bank, which provided uncollateralized borrowings of $7,000,000. Principal
payments were payable in equal monthly installments of $83,000 through June 1,
2002, when the remaining principal amount was paid. Interest was payable monthly
at either the bank base rate or at the LIBOR Rate, as defined in the
agreement, at the Company option.
In connection with the purchase of On-Line Technologies, Inc., the Company
assumed term loans of $4,728,000. The principal and interest accrued are due in

for a manufacturing facility located in Rochester, New York. The terms are the
same as that of the underlying Industrial Development Revenue Bond which calls
for payments of interest only through July 1, 2014, at which time the Bond is
repayable in a lump sum of $5,000,000. Interest is reset annually based on bond
remarketing, with an option by the Company to elect a fixed rate, subject to a
maximum rate of 13% per annum. At December 31, 2002 the interest rate was 210%.
The bond is collateralized by the building. The net book value of the building
at December 31, 2002 was approximately $10,900,000.
On March 6, 2000, the Company entered into a mortgage note payable with a
bank to borrow $10,000,000 to finance the purchase of land and a building.
Principal and interest of $119,000 is being paid in monthly installments with

2002 was $6,071,000. The interest rate at December 31, 2002 was 314%. The net
book value of the land and building at December 31, 2002 was approximately
$18,900,000.
The Company has a loan outstanding from a foreign bank in the form of a
mortgage note at an interest rate of 188%. Principal and interest are payable
in monthly installments through 2005. The loans are collateralized by mortgages
on certain of the Company foreign properties. The remaining principal as of
December 31, 2002 was $687,000.
The terms of the revolving credit facility contain, among other provisions,
requirements for maintaining certain levels of tangible net worth and other
financial ratios. The agreements also contain restrictions with respect to
acquisitions. Under the most restrictive covenant, the Company consolidated
tangible net worth may not be below an amount as defined in the agreement. In
the event of default of these covenants or restrictions, any obligation then
outstanding under the loan agreement shall become payable upon demand by the
bank. The Company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31,
2002.

7 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
On November 30, 2000, Applied Science and Technology, Inc. ASTeX, which
was acquired by MKS in January 2001, brought suit in federal district court in
Delaware against Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. Advanced Energy for
infringement of ASTeX patent related to its Astron product. On May 17, 2002, a
jury affirmed the validity of the Company patent and found that Advanced
Energy infringed the patent. On May 31, 2002, based on the jury findings, the
Court entered a judgement on the infringement claim in favor of the Company and
against Advanced Energy, and awarded $4,200,000 in damages to compensate the
Company for Advanced Energy infringing activity. Advanced Energy filed motions
to overturn the verdict. During August of 2002, the Company and Advanced Energy
entered into an agreement whereby Advanced Energy agreed to pay the awarded
damages amount to the Company and withdraw its motions to overturn the verdict.
The Company received the $4,200,000 in September 2002, and recorded the amount
as Income from litigation settlement.
On November 3, 1999, On-Line Technologies, Inc., which was acquired by the
Company in April 2001, brought suit in federal district court in Connecticut
against Perkin-Elmer, Inc. and certain other defendants for infringement of
On-Line patent related to its FTIR spectrometer product. The suit seeks
injunctive relief and damages for infringement. Perkin-Elmer, Inc. has filed a
counterclaim seeking invalidity of the patent, costs, and attorneys' fees. The
Company believes that the counterclaim is without merit. The Company cannot be
certain of the outcome of this litigation, but does plan to assert its claims
and oppose the counterclaims against it vigorously.

The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims, which have
arisen in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the
ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on
the Company results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
The Company leases certain of its facilities and machinery and equipment
under capital and operating leases expiring in various years through 2002 and
thereafter. Generally, the facility leases require the Company to pay
maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes. Rental expense under operating
leases totaled $6,278,000, $5,122,000 and $4,623,000, for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

As of December 31, 2002, the Company has entered into non-cancelable
purchase commitments for certain inventory components used in its normal
operations. The purchase commitments covered by these arrangements are for
periods of less than one year and aggregate approximately $27,090,000.
Prior to its initial public offering, the Company entered into a Tax
Indemnification and S Corporation Distribution Agreement with its then existing
stockholders the Pre-IPO stockholders. The agreement includes provisions for
the payment, with interest, by the Pre-IPO stockholders or MKS, as the case may
be, for the difference between the $40,000,000 distributed as an estimate of the
amount of the accumulated adjustments account as of April 4, 1999, which is the
date the Company S Corporation status was terminated, and the actual amount of
the accumulated adjustments account on that day. The actual amount of the
accumulated adjustments account was $41,416,619. Accordingly, the Company made
an additional distribution of $1,416,619, plus interest of $177,524, to the
Pre-IPO stockholders during the three months ended September 30, 2000. The
amount of the additional distribution payable had been estimated to be
$3,350,000. This estimated amount was charged directly to retained earnings
during 1999 and had no impact on net income or earnings per share. The
difference of $1,933,000 between the actual additional distribution and the
estimated additional distribution was credited directly to retained earnings
during the three months ended September 30, 2000 and had no impact on net income
or earnings per share. The amount of the accumulated adjustments account can be
affected by future income tax audits of MKS. If any audit increases or decreases
the accumulated adjustments account, MKS or the Pre-IPO stockholders, as the
case may be, will also be required to make a payment, with interest, of such
difference to the other party. No shareholders, other than the Pre-IPO
stockholders, are parties to the Tax Indemnification and S Corporation
Distribution Agreement.
To the extent permitted by Massachusetts law, the Company Restated
Articles of Organization, as amended, requires the Company to indemnify any
current or former officer or director of the Company or any
52
MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
TABLES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
person who has served or is serving in any capacity with respect to any employee
benefit plan of the Company. Because no claim for indemnification has been made
by any person covered by the relevant provisions of the Company Restated
Articles of Organization, the Company believes that its estimated exposure for
these indemnification obligations is currently minimal. Accordingly, the Company
has no liabilities recorded for these requirements as of December 31, 2002.
The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in the ordinary
course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds
harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or
incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company customers, in
connection with any patent, or any other intellectual property infringement
claim by any third party with respect to the Company products. The term of
these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual any time after execution
of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company
could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited.
The Company has never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related
to these indemnification agreements. As a result, the Company believes the
estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, the Company
has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2002.
When as part of an acquisition, the Company acquires all of the stock or
all of the assets and liabilities of another company, the Company assumes
liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of
acquisition. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could
be required to make for such obligations is undeterminable at this time. Other
than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of the acquisition,
historically the Company has not made significant payments for these
indemnifications. Accordingly, no liabilities have been recorded for these
obligations.
In conjunction with certain asset sales, the Company may provide routine
indemnifications whose terms range in duration and often are not explicitly
defined. Where appropriate, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded
as a liability. Because the amount of liability under these types of
indemnifications are not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of the
obligation under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Other
than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of the asset sale,
historically the Company has not made significant payments for these
indemnifications.

During 2002 the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $12,590,000
against all of its United States and foreign net deferred tax assets. A
valuation allowance has been recorded against deferred tax assets because the
Company has determined that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred
tax assets may not be realized. The Company incurred significant operating
losses in 2002 and 2001 and the current outlook indicates that significant
uncertainty will continue into 2003. These cumulative factors resulted in the
Company decision that it is more likely than not that all of its deferred tax
assets may not be realized. If the Company generates sustained future taxable
income against which these tax attributes may be applied, some

portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and a corresponding
reduction in income tax expense would be reported in future periods.
At December 31, 2002, MKS had approximately $25,700,000 of federal net
operating losses including approximately $6,800,000 the utilization of which may
be limited by the change in ownership rules under Section 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code. In addition, at December 31, 2002, MKS also had approximately
$41,400,000 of state net operating losses. The federal and state net operating
losses begin to expire in 2009 and 2006, respectively.
The Company does not provide for a U.S. income tax liability on
undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. The earnings of non-U.S.
subsidiaries, which reflect full provision for non-U.S. incomes taxes, are
indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations or will be remitted substantially
free of additional tax. As of December 31, 2002, the unrecognized deferred tax
liability associated with these unremitted earnings was approximately
$2,500,000.
10 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has a 401k profit-sharing plan for U.S. employees meeting
certain requirements in which eligible employees may contribute from 1% up to
12% of their compensation. The Company, at its discretion, may provide a
matching contribution which will generally match up to the first 2% of each
participant compensation, plus 25% of the next 4% of compensation. At the
discretion of the Board of Directors, the Company may also make additional
contributions for the benefit of all eligible employees. The Company
contributions were $1,938,000, $1,419,000 and $2,960,000 for 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively.
The Company maintains a bonus plan which provides cash awards to key
employees, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors, based upon operating results and employee performance. There was no
bonus expense in the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. Bonus expense to
key employees was $7,579,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000.
11 SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER
See Note 1 for a brief description of the Company business. During 2002,
the Company consolidated its product groups to accelerate product development,
rationalize manufacturing operations, and reduce operating costs. This
realignment of operations has organized the Company into three product groups:
Instruments and Control Systems: Power and Reactive Gas Products; and Vacuum
Products. The Company products are derived from MKS' core competencies in
pressure measurement and control; materials delivery; gas and thin-film
composition analysis; control and information management; power and reactive gas
generation; and vacuum technology. The Company operating segments qualify for
aggregation as the products are manufactured and distributed in a similar
manner, have similar long-term margins and are sold to a similar customer base.
Therefore, the Company has one reportable segment and all financial segment and
product line information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.
The segment information for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 has been
reclassified to conform with these internal organizational changes.
The Company had one customer comprising 23%, 18% and 30% of net sales for
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

12 ACQUISITIONS
On January 31, 2002, MKS completed its acquisition of the ENI Business of
Emerson Electric Co. ENI, a supplier of solid-state RF and DC plasma power
supplies, matching networks and instrumentation to the semiconductor and
thin-film processing industries. The reasons for the acquisition of ENI were
based upon the ability to offer higher value and more integrated application
solutions by combining ENI solid-state power conversion technology with the
Company core competency in plasma and reactive gas solutions. The acquisition
has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The purchase
price was approximately $266,530,000 and consisted of approximately 12,000,000
shares of MKS common stock valued at approximately $261,264,000 and transaction
expenses of approximately $5,266,000. The value of MKS common stock was
approximately $217720 per share based on the average closing price of MKS'
common stock for the five-day period including the date of the announcement of
the signing of the merger agreement and the two days preceding and succeeding
such date.
The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired based upon their
estimated fair values and resulted in an allocation of approximately
$197,123,000 to goodwill. The results of operations are included in

The amounts allocated to acquired intangible assets are being amortized
using the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives: 6
years for completed technology, 8 years for patents, and 8 years for customer
relationships. The total weighted average amortizable life of the acquired
intangible assets is 6 years. Approximately $9,700,000 of the goodwill is tax
deductible.
In connection with the acquisition of ENI, the Company obtained an
appraisal from an independent appraiser of the fair value of its intangible
assets. This appraisal valued purchased in-process research and development
IPR of various projects for the development of new products and
technologies at approximately $7,500,000. Because the technological feasibility
of products under development had not been established and no future alternative
uses existed, the purchased IPR was expensed during the six months ended June
30, 2002. The value of the purchased IPR was determined using the income
approach, which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under
development to their net present value. Each project was analyzed to determine
the technological innovations included; the utilization of core technology; the
complexity, cost and time to complete development; any alternative future use or
current technological feasibility; and the stage of completion. The cash flows
derived from the IPR projects were discounted at rates ranging from 25% to
30%. The Company believes these rates were appropriate given the risks
associated with the technologies for which commercial feasibility had not been
established. The percentage of completion for each in-process project was
determined by identifying the cost incurred to date of the project as a ratio of
the total estimated cost required to bring the project to technical and
commercial feasibility. The percentage of completion for in-process projects
acquired ranged from 65% to 80%, based on management estimates of tasks
completed and the tasks to be completed to bring the projects to technological
and commercial feasibility. The projects were generally expected to have
durations of up to 12 months.
On March 13, 2002, MKS acquired Tenta Technology, Ltd. Tenta, a company
that designs and supplies modular, computer-based process control systems for
300mm semiconductor process tool applications. The reasons for the acquisition
were based upon the ability to offer higher value and more integrated
application solutions by integrating Tenta process controllers with MKS
digital network products to provide a more complete process control solution.
The acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
The purchase price was approximately $26,400,000 and consisted of 700,000 shares
of MKS common stock valued at approximately $21,100,000, cash of $5,000,000 and
transaction expenses of approximately $300,000. The value of MKS common stock
was based on the average closing price of MKS' common stock for the five-day
period including the date of the announcement of the signing of the merger

In 2002, the Company acquired two other businesses for a total purchase
price of $12,200,000, including IPC Fab Automation GmbH, a developer and
provider of web-based hardware and software that enable e-diagnostics and
advanced process control for advanced manufacturing applications. There were no
shares of MKS common stock issued for these acquisitions. Goodwill recognized in
these transactions was approximately $11,000,000 and acquired intangible assets
were approximately $2,800,000.
On April 27, 2001, MKS completed its acquisition of On-Line Technologies,
Inc. On-Line, a company that designs and manufactures products used for gas
analysis, wafer metrology and complementary analysis and control software. The
reasons for the acquisition of On-Line were to expand our range of products for
monitoring the composition of process gases and thin-films, and to provide our
customers with integrated products that help them to increase their
manufacturing yield. The acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting. The purchase price was approximately $23,829,000 and
consisted of approximately 660,000 shares of MKS common stock valued at
approximately $12,110,000, cash payments of $6,295,000, assumption of On-Line
debt of approximately $4,728,000 and transaction expenses of approximately
$696,000. The value of MKS common stock was based on the average closing price
of MKS' common stock for the five-day period including the date of the
announcement of the signing of the merger agreement and the two days preceding
and succeeding such date. The purchase price was allocated to the assets
acquired based upon their estimated fair values and resulted in an allocation of
approximately $16,050,000 to goodwill. The results of operations are included in
the Company consolidated statement of income loss as of and since the
effective date of the purchase. The allocation of the purchase price was as

for the development of new products and technologies at approximately
$2,340,000. The projects were generally expected to have durations of 24 to 48
months. Because the technological feasibility of products under development had
not been established and no future alternative uses existed, the purchased IPR
was expensed during the quarter ended June 30, 2001. The value of the purchased
IPR was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future
cash flows from projects under development to their net present value.
Each project was analyzed to determine the technological innovations
included; the utilization of core technology; the complexity, cost and time to
complete development; any alternative future use or current technological
feasibility; and the stage of completion. The cash flows derived from the
in-process technology projects were discounted at a rate of 25%. The Company
believes this rate was appropriate given the risks associated with the
technologies for which commercial feasibility had not been established. The
percentage of completion for each in-process project was determined by
identifying the elapsed time invested in the project as a ratio of the total
time required to bring the project to technical and commercial feasibility. The
percentage of completion for in-process projects acquired ranged from 55% to
65%, based on management estimates of tasks completed and the tasks to be
completed to bring the projects to technological and commercial feasibility.
On September 6, 2000 the Company acquired D.I.P., Inc., a company with
products and technology in digital process control. The reasons for the
acquisition of D.I.P. were to provide higher value products by incorporating
D.I.P. digital network technology into our existing range of instruments and
to provide our customers with a complete digital network solution as they
migrated from traditional analog to digital control. The purchase price was
$14,000,000 and consisted of $6,900,000 cash; 231,392 shares of MKS common stock
valued at $6,800,000; and $300,000 in acquisition costs. The value of MKS common
stock was based on the average closing price of MKS' common stock for the
five-day period including the date of the announcement of the signing of the
merger agreement and the two days preceding and succeeding such date. The
purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired based on their estimated
fair values. Acquired technology and other intangibles are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over 3 to 5 years. Approximately $4,100,000 of the goodwill
is tax deductible. The allocation of the purchase is as follows

On July 21, 2000 the Company acquired Spectra International, LLC, a
privately held company with products and technology in process monitoring. MKS
acquired Spectra to expand its range of process monitoring products,
particularly in the area of PVD cluster tool monitoring, and to address the
increased needs of our semiconductor device manufacturing customers as they look
to maximize yields in increasingly complex processes. The purchase price
consisted of $9,700,000 cash; 183,293 shares of MKS common stock valued at
$6,500,000; fully vested options to purchase 83,675 shares of MKS common stock
valued at $2,400,000 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, calculated at
an exchange ratio of 04768 shares of MKS common stock per share of Spectra
common stock; and $400,000 in acquisition costs. The value of MKS common stock
was based on the average closing price of MKS' common stock for the five-day
period including the date of the announcement of the signing of the merger
agreement and the two days preceding and succeeding such date. The transaction
also includes contingent earnout payments of up to an aggregate of $12,000,000
over 5 years, which will be treated as compensation expense as it is earned. The
purchase price

was allocated to the assets acquired based on their estimated fair values.
Acquired technology and other intangible assets are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over 5 to 7 years. Approximately $6,000,000 of the goodwill
is tax deductible. The allocation of the purchase price is as follows

The intangible assets include approximately $03 million for acquired
in-process technology for projects that did not have future alternative uses.
The value of the purchased IPR was determined using the income approach, which
discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their
net present value. At the date of the acquisition, the development of these
projects had not yet reached technological feasibility, and the technology in
progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed
in the three months ended September 30, 2000.
Development of in-process technology remains a substantial risk to the
Company due to a variety of factors including the remaining effort to achieve
technical feasibility, rapidly changing customer requirements and competitive
threats from other companies and technologies.
In 2000, the Company acquired three other businesses for a total purchase
price of $16,700,000, including approximately 137,000 shares of MKS common stock
valued at $8,400,000. The acquisitions included a manufacturer of high
performance sputtering equipment for the semiconductor and magnetic storage
industries, a manufacturer of vacuum subsystems, and a company with products and
technology in process monitoring. Goodwill recognized in those transactions was
approximately $12,900,000 and acquired intangible assets were approximately
$1,600,000.

POOLING OF INTEREST COMBINATIONS
On January 26, 2001, MKS acquired ASTeX. Each outstanding share of ASTeX
common stock was exchanged for 07669 newly issued shares of common stock of
MKS, resulting in the issuance of approximately 11,200,000 shares of common
stock of MKS. The acquisition was accounted for under the pooling of interests
method of accounting, and accordingly, the consolidated financial statements
reflect the combined financial position and results of operations and cash flows
of MKS Instruments, Inc. and ASTeX, for all periods presented.
13 SALE OF ASSETS
During 2002, the Company sold an investment in a company for approximately
$2,500,000. The gain on the transaction was not material.
In August 2001, the Company sold certain assets for proceeds of
approximately $9,000,000, consisting of approximately $4,700,000 in cash 3,900,000 in a note receivable, and $200,000 of warrants. The note receivable
matures August 7, 2004, and bears an annual interest rate of 90%. The loss on
the transaction was $1,246,000 before taxes. During 2002, due to the downturn in
the semiconductor industry and its result on the acquirer operations, and the
acquirer inability to raise financing, the Company considered the value of the
note and warrants to be impaired. Accordingly, during 2002, MKS recorded a
charge of $4,121,000 to other expense for the Company estimate of the
impairment on the note receivable and warrants.
In December 2001, the Company sold an investment in a company for
approximately $367,000. The loss on the transaction was $1,133,000 before taxes.
14 RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES
During 2002 the Company implemented a consolidation of recent acquisitions
to accelerate product development, rationalize manufacturing operations, and
reduce operating costs. As a result of these actions, the Company recorded
restructuring and asset impairment charges of $2,726,000 in 2002. The charges
consisted of $631,000 of severance costs related to a workforce reduction 1,228,000 related to consolidation of leased facilities, and an asset
impairment charge of $867,000 primarily related to the impairment of an
intangible asset from the discontinuance of certain product development
activities. The fair value of the impaired intangible asset was determined using
the expected present value of future cash flows. The workforce reduction was
across all functional groups and consisted of 225 employees, with 179 terminated
during 2002. Severance costs of approximately $300,000 were paid in 2002. The
remaining severance costs of $331,000 are expected to be paid by the end of the
first quarter of 2004. The facilities consolidation charges will be paid over
the respective lease terms, the latest of which ends in 2007. The accrual for
severance costs and lease payments is recorded in Other accrued expenses and
Other liabilities.

When the Company acquired the Shamrock product line, it was expected that
sales of the existing system design and development of new system designs would
generate future revenues. Since the acquisition, the Company has provided
potential customers with purchase quotations for Shamrock systems, including a
significant quotation to a potential customer in January 2001 for the sale of
several systems. The potential customer did not purchase the systems, and the
quotation expired in March 2001. The Company has been unsuccessful in selling
any systems of the product line since the acquisition and, with the expiration
of the significant quote in March 2001, the Company evaluated the recoverability
of the long-lived assets, primarily goodwill. As a result, based on discounted
cash flow analysis, the Company recorded an impairment charge for the carrying
value of the related goodwill of approximately $3,720,000 in the quarter ended
March 31, 2001.
15 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
SFAS 142 requires, among other things, the discontinuance of goodwill
amortization. In addition, the standard includes provisions upon adoption for
the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles such as
goodwill, reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangible
assets, and reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported
goodwill. The Company adopted SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002.
In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company reassessed the classification of
its goodwill and intangible assets. This analysis, which was completed during
the quarter ended March 31, 2002, resulted in the reclassification of workforce
related intangible assets of $2,023,000 to goodwill. Also, in accordance with
this statement, the Company reassessed the useful lives of its amortizable
intangible assets and determined that the lives were appropriate.

16 PRODUCT WARRANTIES
The Company provides for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty
obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue. While the Company
engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively
monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company
warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, utilization levels,
material usage, and supplier warranties on parts delivered to the Company.
Should actual product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, or
supplier warranties on parts differ from the Company estimates, revisions to
the estimated warranty liability would be required.
