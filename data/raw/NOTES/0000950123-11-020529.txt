Statements and Supplementary Data   Managements
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting   Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an
adequate system of internal control over financial reporting of
the Company. This system is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles.   Our internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
Company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
Companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance and
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.   Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
system of internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2010. In making this evaluation, management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal
Control Integrated Framework. Based on
managements evaluation and those criteria, management
concluded that the Companys system of internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of December31,
2010.   Managements internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2010 has been audited by Ernst
Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report appearing on the following page, in which
they expressed an unqualified opinion.     Scott W. Wine   Chief Executive Officer     Michael W. Malone   Vice President of Finance   Chief Financial Officer   March1, 2011   Further discussion of our internal controls and procedures is

Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting   The Board of Directors and Shareholders   Polaris Industries Inc.   We have audited Polaris Industries Inc.s internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2010, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria.
Polaris Industries Inc.s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   In our opinion, Polaris Industries Inc. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2010, based on the COSO
criteria.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of Polaris Industries Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2010 and 2009, and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders
equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2010, and our
report dated March1, 2011, expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.     Minneapolis, Minnesota   March1, 2011

on Consolidated Financial Statements   The Board of Directors and Shareholders   Polaris Industries Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Polaris Industries Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of
December31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders equity and
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years

included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at
. These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Polaris Industries Inc. and subsidiaries
at December31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December31, 2010, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States,
Polaris Industries Inc.s internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2010, based on criteria

Organization
and Significant Accounting Policies   Polaris Industries Inc. Polaris or the
Company a Minnesota corporation, and its
subsidiaries, are engaged in the design, engineering,
manufacturing and marketing of innovative, high-quality,
high-performance off-road vehicles snowmobiles, and on-road
vehicles including motorcycles and low emission vehicles.
Polaris products, together with related parts, garments and
accessories are sold worldwide through a network of dealers,
distributors and its subsidiaries located in the United States,
Canada, France, the United Kingdom, Australia, Norway, Sweden,
Germany, Spain, China and Brazil.   Basis of presentation: The accompanying consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Polaris and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Income from
financial services is reported as a component of operating
income to better reflect income from ongoing operations of which
financial services has a significant impact.   In 2004, the Company announced its decision to discontinue the
manufacture of marine products effective immediately. The marine
products divisions financial results are reported
separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented.   The Company evaluates consolidation of entities under Accounting
Standards Codification ASC Topic 810. This Topic
requires management to evaluate whether an entity or interest is
a variable interest entity and whether the company is the
primary beneficiary. Polaris used the guidelines to analyze the
Companys relationships, including the relationship with
Polaris Acceptance, and concluded that there were no variable
interest entities requiring consolidation by the Company in
2010, 2009 and 2008.   Fair Value Measurements: ASC Topic 820 defines fair value
as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or
paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or
most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants on the
measurement date. This Topic also establishes a fair value
hierarchy which requires classification based on observable and
unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three
levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value   Level1 Quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities.   Level2 Observable inputs other than
Level1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or
other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
observable market data for substantially the full term of the
assets or liabilities.   Level3 Unobservable inputs that are
supported by little or no market activity and that are
significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.   The Company utilizes the market approach to measure fair value
for its non-qualified deferred compensation assets, and the
income approach for the interest rate swap agreements, foreign
currency contracts and commodity contracts. The market approach
uses prices and other relevant information generated by market
transactions involving identical or comparable assets or
liabilities and for the income approach the Company uses
significant other observable inputs to

Acceptance provides floor plan financing to Polaris dealers in
the United States. Polaris investment in Polaris
Acceptance is accounted for under the equity method, and is
recorded as investments in finance affiliate in the consolidated
balance sheets. Polaris allocable share of the income of
Polaris Acceptance and the Securitized Receivables has been
included as a component of income from financial services in the
consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note6 for
additional information regarding Polaris investment in
Polaris Acceptance.   Investment in Manufacturing Affiliates: The caption
Investments in manufacturing affiliates in the consolidated
balance sheets represents Polaris equity investment in
Robin Manufacturing, U.S.A. Robin, which builds
engines in the United States for recreational and industrial
products and Polaris equity investment in KTM prior to the
sale of that investment. At December31, 2010, Polaris had
a 40percent ownership interest in Robin. Fuji and Polaris
have agreed to close the Robin facility by mid-2011 as the
production volume of engines made at the facility has declined
significantly in recent years. In the third quarter of 2010, the
Company sold its remaining equity investment in the Austrian
motorcycle company, KTM Power Sports AG KTM which
manufactures off-road and on-road motorcycles, for $9,601,000
and recorded a net gain on securities available for sale of
$1,594,000. Prior to the sale of the KTM investment, the Company
owned less than 5percent of KTMs outstanding shares.
The KTM investment, prior to the sale, had been classified as
available for sale securities under ASC Topic 320. During the
second quarter 2010, the Company determined that the decline in
the fair value of the KTM shares owned by the Company as of
June30, 2010 was other than temporary and therefore
recorded in the statement of income a non-cash impairment charge
on securities held for sale of $769,000. During the first
quarter 2009, the Company determined that the decline in the
fair value of the KTM shares owned by the Company as of
March31, 2009 was other than temporary and therefore

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Use of estimates: The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Ultimate
results could differ from those estimates.   Cash equivalents: Polaris considers all highly liquid
investments purchased with an original maturity of 90days
or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at
cost, which approximates fair value. Such investments consist
principally of commercial paper and money market mutual funds.   Allowance for doubtful accounts: Polaris financial
exposure to collection of accounts receivable is limited due to
its agreements with certain finance companies. For receivables
not serviced through these finance companies, the Company
provides a reserve for doubtful accounts based on historical
rates and trends. This reserve is adjusted periodically as
information about specific accounts becomes available.   Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
first-in,
first-out method or market. The major components of inventories
are as follows in thousands

at cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful life of the respective assets, ranging
from
10-40years
for buildings and improvements and from 1-7years for
equipment and tooling. Fully depreciated tooling is eliminated
from the accounting records annually.   Goodwill and other intangible assets: ASC Topic 350
prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives. Topic 350 requires that these
assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually. An
impairment charge is recognized only when the estimated fair
value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, is less than its
carrying amount. The Company performed analyses as of
December31, 2010 and 2009. The results of the analyses
indicated that no goodwill or intangible impairment existed. In
accordance with Topic 350, the Company will continue to complete
an impairment analysis on an annual basis.   The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years
ended December31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows in

research and development expenses in the period in which they
are incurred as a component of operating expenses. In the years

$40,833,000, $37,433,000 and $51,193,000, respectively.   Shipping and Handling Costs: Polaris records shipping and
handling costs as a component of cost of sales at the time the
product is shipped.   Product warranties: Polaris provides a limited warranty
for its off-road vehicles for a period of six months and for a
period of one year for its snowmobiles and motorcycles. Polaris
may provide longer warranties related to certain promotional
programs, as well as longer warranties in certain geographical
markets as determined by local regulations and market
conditions. Polaris standard warranties require the
Company or its dealers to repair or replace defective products
during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer. The
warranty reserve is established at the time of sale to the
dealer or distributor based on managements best estimate
using historical rates and trends. Adjustments to the warranty
reserve are made from time to time as actual claims become known
in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to settle
future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance
sheet date. Factors that could have an impact on the warranty
accrual in any given year include the following: improved
manufacturing quality, shifts in product mix, changes in
warranty coverage periods, snowfall and its impact on snowmobile
usage, product recalls and any significant changes in sales
volume.   The activity in the warranty reserve during the years presented

dealer or distributor. Examples of sales promotion and incentive
programs include dealer and consumer rebates, volume incentives,
retail financing programs and sales associate incentives. Sales
promotion and incentive expenses are estimated based on current
programs and

STATEMENTSContinued   historical rates for each product line. Actual results may
differ from these estimates if market conditions dictate the
need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs
or if the customer usage rate varies from historical trends.
Polaris recorded accrued liabilities of $75,494,000 and
$67,055,000 related to various sales promotions and incentive
programs as of December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Historically, sales promotion and incentive expenses have been
within the Companys expectations and differences have not
been material.   Dealer holdback programs: Polaris provides dealer
incentive programs whereby at the time of shipment Polaris
withholds an amount from the dealer until ultimate retail sale
of the product. Polaris records these amounts as a reduction of
revenue and a liability on the consolidated balance sheet until
they are ultimately paid. Payments are generally made to dealers
twice each year, in the first quarter and the third quarter,
subject to previously established criteria. Polaris recorded
accrued liabilities of $79,688,000 and $72,229,000, for dealer
holdback programs in the consolidated balance sheets as of
December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.   Foreign currency translation: The functional currency for
each of the Polaris foreign subsidiaries is their respective
local currencies.   The assets and liabilities in all Polaris foreign entities are
translated at the foreign exchange rate in effect at the balance
sheet date. Translation gains and losses are reflected as a
component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in the
shareholders equity section of the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. Revenues and expenses in all of
Polaris foreign entities are translated at the average
foreign exchange rate in effect for each month of the quarter.
The net Accumulated other comprehensive income related to
translation gains and losses was a net gain of $6,991,000 and
$3,861,000 at December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.   Revenue recognition: Revenues are recognized at the time
of shipment to the dealer or distributor or other customers.
Product returns, whether in the normal course of business or
resulting from repossession under its customer financing program
see Note3, have not been material. Polaris withholds an
amount from the dealer for incentive programs and provides for
estimated sales promotion expenses which are recognized as
reductions to sales when products are sold to the dealer or
distributor customer.   Share-based employee compensation: For purposes of
determining estimated fair value of share-based payment awards
on the date of grant under ASC Topic 718, Polaris uses the
Black-Scholes Model. The Black-Scholes Model requires the input
of certain assumptions that require judgment. Because employee
stock options and restricted stock awards have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and
because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect
the fair value estimate, the existing models may not provide a
reliable single measure of the fair value of the employee stock
options or restricted stock awards. Management will continue to
assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate
estimated fair value of share-based compensation. Circumstances
may change and additional data may become available over time,
which could result in changes to these assumptions and
methodologies and thereby materially impact the fair value
determination. If factors change and the Company employs
different assumptions in the application of Topic 718 in future
periods, the compensation expense that was recorded under Topic
718may differ significantly from what was recorded in the
current period. Refer to Note2 for additional information
regarding share-based compensation.   The Company estimates the likelihood and the rate of achievement
for performance sensitive share-based awards, specifically
long-term compensation grants of Long Term Incentive Plan
LTIP and restricted stock. Changes in the
estimated rate of achievement can have a significant effect on
reported share-based compensation expenses as the effect of a
change in the estimated achievement level is recognized in the
period that the likelihood factor changes. If adjustments in the
estimated rate of achievement are made, they would be reflected
in our gross margin and operating expenses.   Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities:
ASC Topic 815 requires that changes in the derivatives
fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific
hedge criteria are met, and requires that a company must
formally document, designate and assess the effectiveness of
transactions that receive hedge accounting. The net unrealized
loss of the derivative instruments of $1,256,000 at
December31, 2010 and the net

STATEMENTSContinued   unrealized gain of $2,436,000 at December31, 2009 were
recorded in the accompanying balance sheets as other current
assets or other current liabilities. Polaris derivative
instruments consist of the interest rate swap agreements and
foreign exchange and commodity contracts discussed below. The
after tax unrealized losses of $1,093,000 and $655,000 as of
December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, were recorded as
components of Accumulated other comprehensive income. The
Companys diesel fuel contracts in 2010 and 2009, and
aluminum contracts in 2010 and 2009 did not meet the criteria
for hedge accounting and therefore, the resulting unrealized
gains from those contracts are included in the consolidated
statements of income in Cost of sales. The unrealized gains for
the diesel fuel contracts for 2010 and 2009 totaled $282,000 and
212,000, respectively, pretax, and the unrealized gains for the
aluminum contracts for 2010 and 2009 totaled $607,000 and
$3,273,000, respectively, pretax.   Interest rate swap agreements: At December31, 2010,
Polaris had two interest rate swaps on a combined $50,000,000 of
borrowings which expires in April 2011. Each of these interest
rate swaps were designated as and met the criteria as cash flow
hedges. The fair value of these swap agreements were calculated
by comparing the fixed rate on the agreement to the market rate
of financial instruments similar in nature. The fair values of
the swaps on December31, 2010 and 2009 were unrealized
losses of $126,000 and $699,000, respectively, which were
recorded as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. Gains and losses resulting from these agreements are
recorded in interest expense when realized. Unrealized gains or
losses, after tax, are recorded as a component of Accumulated
other comprehensive income in Shareholders Equity.   Foreign exchange contracts: Polaris enters into foreign
exchange contracts to manage currency exposures of certain of
its purchase commitments denominated in foreign currencies and
transfers of funds from time to time from its foreign
subsidiaries. Polaris does not use any financial contracts for
trading purposes. These contracts met the criteria for cash flow
hedges. Gains and losses on the Canadian dollar, Norwegian
Krone, Swedish Krona, and Australian dollar contracts at
settlement are recorded in Nonoperating other expense income.
Gains and losses on the Japanese yen contracts at settlement are
recorded in Cost of sales. Unrealized gains or losses, after
tax, are recorded as a component of Accumulated other
comprehensive income in Shareholders Equity. The fair
value of the foreign exchange contracts was a net liability of
$2,019,000 as of December31, 2010 and a net liability of
$350,000 as of December31, 2009.   Commodity derivative contracts: Polaris is subject to
market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain purchased
commodity raw materials including steel, aluminum, fuel, and
petroleum-based resins. In addition, the Company purchases
components and parts containing various commodities, including
steel, aluminum, rubber and others which are integrated into the
Companys end products. While such materials are typically
available from numerous suppliers, commodity raw materials are
subject to price fluctuations. The Company generally buys these
commodities and components based upon market prices that are
established with the vendor as part of the purchase process.
From time to time, Polaris utilizes derivative contracts to
hedge a portion of the exposure to commodity risks. During 2010
and 2009, the Company entered into derivative contracts to hedge
a portion of the exposure for diesel fuel and aluminum. These
contracts did not meet the criteria for hedge accounting and the
resulting unrealized gains and losses are recorded in the
consolidated statements of income as a component of cost of
sales. The fair value of the commodity derivative contracts was
a net asset of $889,000 as of December31, 2010 and a net
asset of $3,485,000 as of December31, 2009.   Comprehensive income: Components of comprehensive income
include net income, foreign currency translation adjustments,
unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments, and
unrealized gains or losses on securities held for sale, net of
tax. The Company has chosen to disclose comprehensive income in
the accompanying consolidated statements of shareholders
equity and comprehensive income.   New accounting pronouncements: Improving Disclosure about

collectively with the Option Plan, Restricted Plan and Broad
Based Plan, the Prior Plans were frozen and no
further grants or awards have since been or will be made under
such plans. A maximum of 2,750,000shares of common stock
are available for issuance under the Omnibus Plan, together with
additional shares cancelled or forfeited under the Prior Plans.   Stock option awards granted to date under the Omnibus Plan
generally vest two to four years from the award date and expire
after ten years. In addition, the Company has granted a total of
45,000 deferred stock units to its non-employee directors under
the Omnibus Plan since 2007 10,000, 16,000 and 11,600 in 2010,
2009 and 2008, respectively which will be converted into common
stock when the directors board service ends or upon a
change in control. Restricted shares awarded under the Omnibus
Plan to date generally contain restrictions which lapse after a
two to four year period if Polaris achieves certain performance
measures.   Under the Option Plan, incentive and nonqualified stock options
for a maximum of 8,200,000shares of common stock could be
issued to certain employees. Options granted to date generally
vest three years from the award date and expire after ten years.   Under the Broad Based Plan, incentive stock options for a
maximum of 700,000shares of common stock could be issued
to substantially all Polaris employees. Options with respect to
675,400shares of common stock were granted under this plan
during 1999 at an exercise price of $1578 and of the options
initially granted under the Broad Based Plan, an aggregate of
518,400 vested in March 2002. This plan and any outstanding
options expired in 2009.

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Under the Restricted Plan, a maximum of 2,350,000shares of
common stock could be awarded as an incentive to certain
employees with no cash payments required from the recipient. The
majority of the outstanding awards contain restrictions which
lapse after a two to four year period if Polaris achieves
certain performance measures.   Under the Director Stock Option Plan, nonqualified stock options
for a maximum of 200,000shares of common stock could be
issued to non-employee directors. Each non-employee director as
of the date of the annual shareholders meetings through 2006 was
granted an option to purchase 4,000shares of common stock
at a price per share equal to the fair market value as of the
date of grant. Options become exercisable as of the date of the
next annual shareholders meeting following the date of grant and
must be exercised no later than 10years from the date of
grant.   Under the Polaris Industries Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for
Directors Director Plan members of the Board of
Directors who are not Polaris officers or employees receive
annual grants of common stock equivalents and may also elect to
receive additional common stock equivalents in lieu of
directors fees, which will be converted into common stock
when board service ends. A maximum of 250,000shares of
common stock has been authorized under this plan of which
115,249 equivalents have been earned and an additional
100,200shares have been issued to retired directors as of
December31, 2010. As of December31, 2010 and 2009,
Polaris liability under the plan totaled $8,992,000 and
$5,690,000, respectively.   Polaris maintains a long term incentive plan under which awards
are issued to provide incentives for certain employees to attain
and maintain the highest standards of performance and to attract
and retain employees of outstanding competence and ability with
no cash payments required from the recipient. The awards are
paid in cash and are based on certain Company performance
measures that are measured over a period of three consecutive
calendar years. At the beginning of the plan cycle, participants
have the option to receive a cash value at the time of awards or
a cash value tied to Polaris stock price movement over the three
year plan cycle. At December31, 2010 and 2009,
Polaris liability under the plan totaled $49,745,000 and
$4,587,000, respectively.   Share-based compensation expense: The amount of
compensation cost for share-based awards to be recognized during
a period is based on the portion of the awards that are
ultimately expected to vest. The Company estimates stock option
forfeitures at the time of grant and revises those estimates in
subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
estimates. The Company analyzes historical data to estimate
pre-vesting forfeitures and records share compensation expense
for those awards expected to vest.   Total share-based compensation expenses were as follows

Savings Plans   Polaris sponsors a qualified non-leveraged employee stock
ownership plan ESOP under which a maximum of
3,600,000shares of common stock can be awarded. The shares
are allocated to eligible participants accounts based on total
cash compensation earned during the calendar year. Shares vest
immediately and require no cash payments from the recipient.
Participants may instruct Polaris to pay respective dividends
directly to the participant in cash or reinvest the dividends
into the participants ESOP accounts. Substantially all employees
are eligible to participate in the ESOP, with the exception of
Company officers. Total expense related to the ESOP was
$8,123,000, $0, and $6,706,000, in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. In 2009, the Company suspended its annual
contribution of shares into the ESOP as a cost reduction
measure; however, contributions were made again in 2010. As of
December31, 2010 there were 2,475,000shares vested
in the plan.   Polaris sponsors a 401k retirement savings plan under which
eligible United States employees may choose to contribute up to
50percent of eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis,
subject to certain IRS limitations. The Company matches
100percent of employee contributions up to a maximum of
five percent of eligible compensation. Matching contributions
were $7,073,000, $6,827,000, and $7,251,000, in 2010, 2009 and

Financing   Bank financing:Polaris is a party to an
unsecured bank agreement comprised of a $250,000,000 revolving
loan facility for working capital needs and a $200,000,000 term
loan. The entire amount of the $200,000,000 term loan was
utilized in December 2006 to fund an accelerated share
repurchase transaction. Interest is charged at rates based on
LIBOR or prime. The agreement contains various
restrictive covenants which limit investments, acquisitions and
indebtedness. The agreement also requires Polaris to maintain
certain financial ratios including minimum interest coverage and
a maximum leverage ratio. Polaris was in compliance with each of
the covenants as of December31, 2010. The agreement
expires on December2, 2011 and the outstanding borrowings
mature.   The following summarizes activity under Polaris credit

criteria of cash flow hedges.   In December 2010, the Company entered into a Master Note
Purchase Agreement to issue $25,000,000 of 381percent
unsecured Senior Notes due May 2018 and $75,000,000 of
460percent unsecured Senior Notes due May 2021
collectively, The Senior Notes. The Senior Notes
are expected to be issued in May 2011. As a result, the Company
has classified $100,000,000 of the $200,000,000 term loan
outstanding as of December31, 2010 as a long-term
liability in the consolidated balance sheet.   The Company entered into and settled an interest rate lock
contract in November 2009 in connection with the Master Note
Purchase Agreement. The interest rate lock settlement resulted
in a $251,000 gain, net of deferred taxes of $149,000, which
will be amortized into income over the life of the related debt.   Letters of credit:At December31, 2010,
Polaris had open letters of credit totaling approximately
$3,961,000. The amounts outstanding are reduced as inventory
purchases pertaining to the contracts are received.   Dealer financing programs:Certain finance
companies, including Polaris Acceptance, an affiliate see
Note6, provide floor plan financing to dealers on the
purchase of Polaris products. The amount financed by worldwide
dealers under these arrangements at December31, 2010, was
approximately $667,607,000. Polaris has agreed to repurchase
products repossessed by the finance companies up to an annual
maximum of no more than 15percent of the average month-end
balances outstanding during the prior calendar year.
Polaris financial exposure under these arrangements is
limited to the difference between the amount paid to the finance
companies for repurchases and the amount received on the resale
of the repossessed product. No material losses have been
incurred under these agreements during the periods presented. As
a part of its marketing program, Polaris contributes to the cost
of dealer financing up to certain limits and subject to certain
conditions. Such expenditures are included as an offset to Sales
in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Services Arrangements   In 1996, one of Polaris wholly-owned subsidiaries entered
into a partnership agreement with a subsidiary of Transamerica
Distribution Finance TDF to formPolaris
Acceptance. In 2004, TDF was merged with a subsidiary of General
Electric Company and, as a result of that merger, TDFs
name was changed to GECDF. Polaris subsidiary has a
50percent equity interest in Polaris Acceptance. In
November 2006, Polaris Acceptance sold a majority of its
receivable portfolio to the securitization facility arranged by
General Electric Capital Corporation, a GECDF affiliate
Securitization Facility, and the partnership
agreement was amended to provide that Polaris Acceptance would
continue to sell portions of its receivable portfolio to a
Securitization Facility from time to time on an ongoing basis.
At December31, 2010 and 2009, the outstanding balance of
receivables sold by Polaris Acceptance to the Securitization
Facility the Securitized Receivables amounted to
approximately $323,790,000 and $387,503,000, respectively. The
sale of receivables from Polaris Acceptance to the
Securitization Facility is accounted for in Polaris
Acceptances financial statements as a
true-sale under ASC Topic 860. Polaris Acceptance is
not responsible for any continuing servicing costs or
obligations with respect to the Securitized Receivables.
Polaris subsidiary and GECDF have an income sharing
arrangement related to income generated from the Securitization
Facility. The remaining portion of the receivable portfolio is
recorded on Polaris Acceptances books, and is funded to
the extent of 85percent through a loan from an affiliate
of GECDF. Polaris has not guaranteed the outstanding
indebtedness of Polaris Acceptance or the Securitized
Receivables. In addition, the two partners of Polaris Acceptance
share equally an equity cash investment equal to 15percent
of the sum of the portfolio balance in Polaris Acceptance plus
the Securitized Receivables. Polaris total investment in
Polaris Acceptance at December31, 2010 and 2009, was
$37,169,000 and $41,332,000, respectively. The Polaris
Acceptance partnership agreement provides for periodic options
for renewal, purchase, or termination by either party.
Substantially all of Polaris United States sales are
financed through Polaris Acceptance and the Securitization
Facility whereby Polaris receives payment within a few days of
shipment of the product. The net amount financed for dealers
under this arrangement at December31, 2010, including both
the portfolio balance in Polaris Acceptance and the Securitized
Receivables, was $497,830,000. Polaris has agreed to repurchase
products repossessed by Polaris Acceptance up to an annual
maximum of 15percent of the average month-end balances
outstanding during the prior calendar year. For calendar year
2010, the potential 15percent aggregate repurchase
obligation was approximately $81,443,000. Polaris
financial exposure under this arrangement is limited to the
difference between the amounts unpaid by the dealer with respect
to the repossessed product plus costs of repossession and the
amount received on the resale of the repossessed product. No
material losses have been incurred under this agreement during
the periods presented. Polaris trade receivables from
Polaris Acceptance were $29,000 and $1,837,000 at
December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Polaris
exposure to losses with respect to the Polaris Acceptance
Portfolio and the Securitized Receivables is limited to its

into a multi-year contract with HSBC Bank Nevada, National
Association HSBC, formerly known as Household Bank
SB, N.A., under which HSBC is continuing to manage the Polaris
private label credit card program under the StarCard label,
which until July 2007 included providing retail credit for
non-Polaris products. The 2005 agreement provides for income to
be paid to Polaris based on a percentage of the volume of
revolving retail credit business generated including non-Polaris
products. The previous agreement provided for equal sharing of
all income and losses with respect to the retail credit
portfolio, subject to certain limitations. The 2005 contract
removed all credit, interest rate and funding risk to Polaris
and also eliminated the need for Polaris to maintain a retail
credit cash deposit with HSBC, which was approximately
$50,000,000 at August1, 2005. HSBC ceased financing
non-Polaris products under its arrangement with Polaris
effective July1, 2007. During the first quarter of 2008,
HSBC notified the Company that the profitability to HSBC of the
2005 contractual arrangement was unacceptable and, absent some
modification of that arrangement, HSBC might significantly
tighten its underwriting standards for Polaris customers,
reducing the number of qualified retail credit customers who
would be able to obtain credit from HSBC. In order to avoid the
potential reduction of revolving retail credit available to
Polaris consumers, Polaris began to forgo the receipt of a
volume based fee provided for under its agreement with HSBC
effective March1, 2008. Management currently anticipates
that the elimination of the volume based fee will continue and
that HSBC will continue to provide revolving retail credit to
qualified customers through the end of the contract term. During
the 2010 second quarter Polaris and HSBC extended the term of
the agreement on similar terms to October 2013.   In April 2006, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Polaris entered into
a multi-year contract with GE Money Bank GE Bank
under which GE Bank makes available closed-end installment
consumer and commercial credit to customers of Polaris dealers
for both Polaris and non-Polaris products. In November 2010, the
Company extended its installment credit agreement to March 2016
under which GE Bank will provide exclusive installment credit
lending for Victory motorcycles only. Polaris income
generated from the GE Bank agreement has been included as a

October 2010, Polaris extended its installment credit agreement
to February 2016 under which Sheffield will provide exclusive

Investment
in Manufacturing Affiliates   The caption Investments in manufacturing affiliates in the
consolidated balance sheets represents Polaris equity
investment in Robin Manufacturing, U.S.A. Robin,
which builds engines in the United States for recreational and
industrial products as well as Polaris equity investment
in KTM prior to the 2010 third quarter. At December31,
2010, Polaris had a 40percent ownership interest in Robin.
Fuji and Polaris have agreed to close the Robin facility by
mid-2011 as the production volume of engines made at the
facility has declined significantly in recent years. In the
third quarter of 2010, the Company sold its remaining equity
investment in the Austrian motorcycle company, KTM Power Sports
AG KTM which manufactures off-road and on-road
motorcycles, for $9,601,000 and recorded a net gain on
securities available for sale of $1,594,000. Prior to the sale
of the KTM investment, the Company owned less than
5percent of KTMs outstanding shares. The KTM
investment, prior to the sale, had been classified as available
for sale securities under ASC Topic 320. During the second
quarter 2010, the Company determined that the decline in the
fair value of the KTM shares owned by the Company as of
June30, 2010 was other than temporary and therefore
recorded in the income statement a non-cash impairment charge on
securities held for sale of $769,000. During the first quarter
2009, the Company determined that the decline in the fair value
of the KTM shares owned by the Company as of March31, 2009
was other than temporary and therefore recorded in the income
statement a non-cash impairment charge on securities held for
sale of $8,952,000.   Polaris investments in manufacturing affiliates, including
associated transaction costs, totaled $1,009,000 at
December31, 2010 and $10,536,000 at December31,
2009. The investment in Robin is accounted for under the equity
method.   
Note8   
Commitments
and Contingencies   Product liability: Polaris is subject to product
liability claims in the normal course of business. Polaris is
currently self-insured for all product liability claims. The
estimated costs resulting from any losses are charged to
operating expenses when it is probable a loss has been incurred
and the amount of the loss is reasonably determinable. The
Company utilizes historical trends and actuarial analysis tools
to assist in determining the appropriate loss reserve levels. At
December31, 2010 the Company had an accrual of $11,956,000
for the probable payment of pending claims related to continuing
operations. This accrual is included as a component of Other
Accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. In addition, the Company had an accrual of $1,550,000
for the probable payment of pending claims related to
discontinued operations at December31, 2010.   Litigation: Polaris is a defendant in lawsuits and
subject to claims arising in the normal course of business. In
the opinion of management, it is unlikely that any legal
proceedings pending against or involving Polaris will have a
material adverse effect on Polaris financial position or
results of operations.   Leases: Polaris leases buildings and equipment under
non-cancelable operating leases. Total rent expense under all
lease agreements was $5,553,000, $4,999,000 and $5,777,000 for
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities   The Company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing
business operations. The primary risks managed by using
derivative instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate
risk and commodity price fluctuations. Forward exchange
contracts on various currencies are entered into in order to
manage foreign currency exposures associated with certain
product sourcing activities and intercompany sales. Interest
rate swaps are entered into in order to manage interest rate
risk associated with the Companys variable-rate
borrowings. Commodity hedging contracts are entered into in
order to manage fluctuating market prices of certain purchased
commodities and raw materials that are integrated into the
Companys end products.   The Companys foreign currency management objective is to
mitigate the potential impact of currency fluctuations on the
value of its United States dollar cash flows and to reduce the
variability of certain cash flows at the subsidiary level. The
Company actively manages certain forecasted foreign currency
exposures and uses a centralized currency management operation
to take advantage of potential opportunities to naturally offset
foreign currency exposures against each other. The decision of
whether and when to execute derivative instruments, along with
the duration of the instrument, can vary from period to period
depending on market conditions, the relative costs of the
instruments and capacity to hedge. The duration is linked to the
timing of the underlying exposure, with the connection between
the two being regularly monitored. Polaris does not use any
financial contracts for trading purposes. At December31,
2010, Polaris had open Canadian Dollar contracts with notional
amounts totaling United States $122,895,000 and a net unrealized
loss of $1,544,000, open Swedish Krona contracts with notional
amounts totaling United States $4,790,000 and an unrealized gain
of $39,000, and open Australian Dollar contracts with notional
amounts totaling $6,255,000 and a net unrealized loss of
$514,000. These contracts have maturities through December 2011.
The Company had no open Yen, Euro, or Norwegian Krone foreign
currency derivative contracts in place at December31, 2010.   Polaris has entered into derivative contracts to hedge a portion
of the exposure for gallons of diesel fuel for 2011 and metric
tons of aluminum for 2011. These diesel fuel and aluminum
derivative contracts did not meet the criteria for hedge
accounting.

Manufacturing
Realignment   In May 2010, the Company announced that it was realigning its
manufacturing operations. The realignment will consolidate
operations into existing operations in Roseau, MN and Spirit
Lake, IA as well as establish a new facility in Monterrey,
Mexico. The realignment is expected to lead to the sale or
closure of the Osceola, WI manufacturing operations by 2012. The
Company expects to record transition charges, including both
exit costs and startup costs, over the next few years. The exit
costs pertaining to the manufacturing realignment are expected
to total approximately $10,000,000 over that time period. The

2accumulated and communicated to the Companys
management including its Chief Executive Officer and Vice
President Finance and Chief Financial Officer, in a
manner that allows timely decisions regarding required
