INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
ChromaVision Medical Systems, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
ChromaVision Medical Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2000 and
2001 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders
equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2001. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
ChromaVision Medical Systems, Inc., and subsidiaries as of December31, 2000
and 2001 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2001 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We develop, manufacture and market the ACIS automated cellular imaging
system, which is designed to substantially improve the accuracy, sensitivity,
and reproducibility of cell imaging. Unlike manual methods of viewing and
analysis, the ACIS combines proprietary, color-based imaging technology with
automated microscopy to assist the pathologist in making critical medical
decisions. In July 1999, the FDA granted clearance for use of the ACIS system
to assist the pathologist to detect, count and classify cells of clinical
interest based on recognition of cellular objects of particular color, size,
and shape.
2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies aBasis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the results of operations,
account balances and cash flows of the Company and our wholly owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. bChange in Development Stage Status From the inception of the business on April1, 1993 to September30, 1999,
we were considered to be in the development stage as defined by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No7, Accounting and Reporting by
Development Stage Enterprises. In the fourth quarter of 1999, we exited the
development stage as significant revenue was realized from planned operations. cRevenue Recognition We place most of our instruments with users on a fee-per-use basis. We
obtain the billing information via modem, which accesses the ACIS database.
Revenue is recognized based on the greater of actual usage fees or the minimum
monthly rental fee. Under this pricing model, we will own most of the ACIS
instruments that are engaged in service and, accordingly, all related
depreciation and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. For those
instruments that are sold, we have adopted Statement of Position 97-2 SOP
97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, which requires that revenue from
software arrangements be allocated to each element of the arrangement based on
the relative fair values of the elements, such as software products, upgrades,
enhancements, post contract customer support and installation. Revenue on
product sales is recognized upon acceptance by the customer subsequent to a
testing and evaluation period. Certain sales require continuing service,
support and performance by us, and accordingly a portion of the revenue is
deferred and recognized over the future service, support and performance
period. Some instruments are placed through distributors in Europe who are paid
commissions based on a percentage of fees paid for use of the system as the
fees accrue or as the sales take place. dCash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts held as bank deposits and
highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity of three months or less.
No single investment exceeded 5% of the combined total of
cash and cash equivalents at December31, 2000 and 2001. We have not experienced any significant losses on cash equivalents and do
not believe we are exposed to any significant credit risk on such cash
equivalents. 29 Table of Contents eDepreciation and Amortization Property and equipment are depreciated and amortized on the straight-line

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment utilizing undiscounted
estimated future cash flows from the use of the assets whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If the fair value, based on present value of estimated future cash
flows, is less than the carrying amount of the assets, a loss is recognized for
the difference. fIncome Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. gStock-Based Compensation We apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees APB 25, for stock options and other stock-based awards
to employees while disclosing pro forma net loss and net loss per share as if
the fair value method had been applied in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS No123, see Note 4. The fair value of options granted to
non-employees is expensed over the performance period or at the time when a
performance commitment is reached. hNet Loss Per Share Basic and diluted loss per common share is calculated by dividing net loss
by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the year. Stock
options and warrants to purchase 2,121,675, 2,642,076, and 3,818,810 shares of
common stock were outstanding at December31, 1999, 2000 and 2001,
respectively. These stock options and warrants outstanding were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share because we incurred a loss in all
periods presented and hence, the impact would be antidilutive. For the period
ended December31, 2001, dilutive potential common shares of approximately
1,901,256 consisting of convertible preferred stock have also been excluded
from the computation of diluted income per share as their effect is
anti-dilutive. 30 Table of Contents iUse of Estimates The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. Significant estimates include the depreciation and
valuation of ACIS systems and ACIS in progress
and receivables valuations as well as valuation of the stock warrants and the
beneficial conversion feature of the convertible, redeemable preferred stock. jFinancial Instruments We estimate the fair value of our monetary assets and liabilities based
upon the existing interest rates related to such assets and liabilities
compared to current market rates of interest for instruments with a similar
nature and degree of risk. We estimate that the fair value of all of our
monetary assets and liabilities approximates the recorded value as of December
31, 2000 and 2001. kAccounts Receivable Our customer base is comprised of two principal market segments, 1 the
clinical market which consists of hospitals, pathology practice groups and
reference laboratories and 2 the research and biotechnology market which
consists of pharmaceutical companies, universities and research institutions.
Our customer base is geographically diverse and historically we have not
experienced significant losses related to receivables for our fee-per-use
revenue. We periodically perform credit evaluations on our customers and we do
not require collateral. The majority of our customers are billed monthly based
on their fee-per-use activity. We estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts
based upon the actual payment history of each customer in addition to reserving
for a portion of receivables that are delinquent. Accounts receivable is net of
a reserve for doubtful accounts at December31, 2000 and 2001, of $130,000 and
$287,000, respectively. We are not materially dependent on any individual customer. Our largest
customer, excluding ACIS system sales, approximated 9% or $110,000 and 10% or
$474,000 of total revenue for December31, 2000 and 2001, respectively. When a
sale of one of our systems is made, the sale price is large in relation to the
income flow from leasing for a single year. However, ACIS sales are made only
occasionally, ChromaVision has never sold more than one system to a customer,
and ChromaVision believes that it is not dependent upon any past sale customer
for future revenue. lRecent Accounting Developments In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASBissued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFASNo141, Business
Combinations and No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No141
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business
combinations initiated after June30, 2001. SFAS No141 also specifies
criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business
combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill, noting
that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be
accounted for separately. SFAS No142 will require that goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but
instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No142. SFAS No142 will also require that intangible
assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated
useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in
accordance with SFAS No121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. We were required to adopt
the provisions of SFAS No141 immediately and SFAS No142 effective January
1, 2002. Furthermore, any goodwill and any intangible asset determined to have
an indefinite useful life that is acquired in a purchase business combination
completed after June30, 2001 will not be amortized, but will continue to be
evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre-SFAS No142
accounting literature. The implementation of SFAS No141 and SFAS No142
will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of
operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which supersedes both SFAS No.
121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of, and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB
Opinion No30, Reporting the Results of OperationsReporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and
Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions Opinion 30, for the disposal
of a segment of a business as previously defined in that Opinion. SFAS No.
144 retains the fundamental provisions in SFAS No121 for recognizing and
measuring impairment losses on long-lived assets held for use and long-lived
assets to be disposed of by sale, while also resolving significant
implementation issues associated with SFAS No121. For example, SFAS No144
provides guidance on how a long-lived asset that is used as part of a group
should be evaluated for impairment, establishes criteria for when a
31 Table of Contents long-lived asset is held for sale, and prescribes the accounting for a
long-lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale. SFAS No144
retains the basic provisions of Opinion 30 on how to present discontinued
operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a
component of an entity rather than a segment of a business. Unlike SFAS No.
121, an impairment assessment under SFAS No144 will never result in a
write-down of goodwill. Rather, goodwill is evaluated for impairment under SFAS
No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
We are required and plan to adopt SFAS No144 in the quarter ending March
31, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No144 for long-lived assets held
for use to have a material impact on our financial statements because the
impairment assessment under SFAS No144 is largely unchanged from SFAS No.
121. The provisions of the Statement for assets held for sale or other disposal
generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to
newly initiated disposal activities. Therefore, we cannot determine the
potential effects that adoption of SFAS No144 will have on our financial
statements mForeign Currency Translation The financial position and results of operations of our foreign
subsidiaries are generally determined using their local currency as the
functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are
translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Statement of
operations accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing
during the year. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing
exchange rates from period to period are included in accumulated other
comprehensive loss in stockholders equity. Foreign currency translation
lossesand gains were $28,630, $67,822 and $8,644 for the years ending
December31, 1999, 2000 and 2001. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses were not material in any of
the periods presented. 3Line of Credit We have an agreement with our principal bank for a $5,000,000 revolving
line of credit. The line expires on May30, 2002 and we do not intend to
extend or renew the revolving line of credit. At our option, the interest rate
is either prime less 025% or LIBOR plus 175%. There were no borrowings
outstanding under the line of credit during the period. Any borrowings
outstanding under the line of credit will be collateralized by our investment
in securities held by the principal bank having a market value equal to 111% of
the principal balance of the loans. 4Stock Options We have a stock option plan the Plan pursuant to which our Board of
Directors or a committee of the Board may grant stock options to employees,
directors and consultants. The Plan authorizes grants of options to purchase
up to 3,700,000 shares of authorized but unissued common stock. All options
granted by us had an exercise price equal to the stocks fair value at the date
of grant. Stock options granted have terms of up to ten years and become
exercisable in increments over periods of up to four years. We granted non-qualified stock options in 1999, 2000 and 2001 to purchase
30,000 shares, 61,000 shares, and 35,500 shares respectively, to consultants
of ChromaVision at prices between $319 and $531 per share. We
recorded compensation expense of approximately, $50,000, $75,000, and $58,000
for the years ended December31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 respectively, related to
these consultant options. At December31, 2001, consultant options to purchase
approximately 213,000 shares were exercisable. Option activity is summarized as follows

As of December31, 2001, we have net operating loss carryforwards for
federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $59,184,000 and
$36,933,000, respectively, which will commence expiration in 2011 and 2005,
respectively. As of December31, 2001, we have tax credit carryforwards for
federal and state income tax purposes of $1,547,000 and $1,390,000,
respectively, which will begin to expire in 2011. In accordance with Internal Revenue Code section 382, the annual
utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and credits existing prior to a
change in control in the company may be limited after a change in control. 6Related Party Transactions We have historically had an administrative services agreement with
Safeguard Scientifics, Inc. under which Safeguard Scientifics, Inc. provided us with
administrative support services, including management consultation, investor
relations, legal services and tax planning. In consideration for these
services, we were obligated to pay an annual fee of 075% of our gross revenues
each year to Safeguard Scientifics, Inc. up to a maximum of $300,000 per year in the aggregate.
Fees were to accrue until we achieved a positive cash flow from operations.
Effective April1, 2000, this agreement and the obligation to make payments
thereunder were mutually terminated without any payment. We had accrued
charges of approximately $12,000 at the time of termination. We also entered
into the same administrative service agreement with XL Vision, Inc. During
2001, XL Vision entered into Chapter7 bankruptcy proceedings and is currently
in liquidation. Approximately $21,000 remains accrued under this agreement as
of December31, 2001. We earned $115,000 of interest income on a demand note receivable from
Safeguard Scientifics, Inc. during 1999. 7Commitments and Contingencies Voluntary
Employee Retirement 401k Plan. We have a voluntary employee
retirement 401k plan, which is available to all full time employees 21years
or older. Through 2001, the plan provided for a matching by us of the
employees contribution to the plan for 50% of the first 6% of the employees
annual compensation. Beginning in 2002, the plan provides for a matching by us
of the employees contribution to the plan for 333% of the first 6% of the
employees annual compensation. Our matching contributions were approximately
$116,000, $153,000, and $181,000 for the years ended December31, 1999, 2000
and 2001, respectively. Lease Commitment. We utilized various operating leases for office space,
furniture, and an automobile. We purchased the furniture at the end of its
lease in 2001. The office space and automobile leases both terminate in 2003.
At that time, we expect that we will enter into a subsequent lease agreement
for office space. Rental commitments under these agreements for 2002 and 2003
are
34 Table of Contents approximately $157,000 and $29,000, respectively. Total rent expense
related to these leases was approximately $163,000, $177,000, and $169,000 for
years ended December31, 1999, 2000, and 2001.
Regulatory. In November 2000, we received a warning letter from FDAs
Center for Devices and Radiological Health CDRHwhich took issue with certain
claims being made for our ACIS device. The letter questioned the basis for
certain claims and whether certain uses of the device exceeded the scope of
FDAs clearance of ACIS. In May 2001, we resolved those issues through a series
of communications with the FDA. As a result of this resolution, we continue to
market our product to physicians to detect, count and classify cells of
clinical interest based on recognition of color, size and shape. 8Stock Transactions In October 1999, we completed a private placement of 1,775,000 shares of
common stock to selected institutional and other accredited investors. The net
proceeds from the sale of the shares were approximately $185million. The
shares were registered for resale under the Securities Act of 1933 shortly
after they were issued. In September 2000, we completed the private placement of 560,693 shares of
our common stock and warrants to purchase 56,070 additional shares of our
common stock to two institutional investors for a purchase price of $7million.
The net proceeds from the sale of the shares were approximately $67million.
The purchase price per share was $1248 and was based upon an average of high
and low trading prices of our common stock for a 20-day period prior to the
sale. The warrants have a term of five years and are exercisable at the same
$1248 per share price. Of the $7,000,000 purchase price, $5,000,000 was
purchased by a wholly owned subsidiary of Safeguard Scientifics, Inc., and
$2,000,000 was purchased by VennWorks LLC, a private investment fund. Safeguard
Scientifics, Inc. already held approximately 27% of our outstanding shares, and
VennWorks was also a stockholder. We have since registered the shares purchased
and the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants for resale under the
Securities Act of 1933 under certain circumstances. In September 2000, we amended our Stockholder Rights Plan, which had been
adopted in March 1999 and was previously amended in June 1999. The Stockholder
Rights Plan provides for the distribution of rights to purchase additional
shares of our capital stock in the event any person, entity or group acquires
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our outstanding voting shares. The Plan
included an exception for acquisitions of shares by persons, entities or groups
who, as of February10, 1999, were the beneficial owner of more than 15% of the
outstanding shares of our common stock. These beneficial owners are referred
to below as Existing 15% Owners. That exemption in the Plan applied only if
1an Existing 15% Owner continued to own at least 15% of our Voting Shares
and 2did not acquire additional Voting Shares which would cause the Existing
15% Owners beneficial ownership of Voting Shares to exceed 40% of the number
of shares outstanding. This
amendment to the Plan made three changes. First, it exempts from the
provision described above the acquisition of 400,495 shares of common stock and
warrants to purchase an additional 40,050 shares of common stock acquired by
the subsidiary of Safeguard Scientifics, Inc., in the private placement
described above. Second, it amends the definition of 15% Stockholder to
exclude any Exempted Group. Third, it defines Exempted Group as any group
consisting of Safeguard, its affiliates and associates, and VennWorks LLC and
its affiliates and associates, but only so long as iSafeguard Scientifics,
Inc. and its affiliates and associates beneficially own more than a majority of
our voting shares beneficially owned in the aggregate by Safeguard Scientifics,
Inc., its affiliates and associates, VennWorks LLC and its affiliates and
associates and iiSafeguard Scientifics, Inc., its affiliates and associates,
and VennWorks LLC and its affiliates and associates do not beneficially own in
the aggregate more than 45% of our Voting Shares then outstanding. In January 2001, we entered into a financing agreement with VennWorks LLC
providing for VennWorks to invest up to $5million in our common stock at
various dates and in amounts selected by us from March30, 2001 through
December28, 2001 subject to certain limitations. The price per share was
based upon the average closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq National
Market during a 20-day trading period prior to our request to purchase, subject
to a minimum of $7 per share and a maximum of $14 per share. VennWorks had
invested $400,000 at a per share price of approximately $7 per share pursuant
to this arrangement but missed other payments due to us. As a result we
accelerated the date when the entire balance of the shares were to be
purchased. VennWorks failed to complete the purchase and has advised us that
it does not have the funds to do so. On July10, 2001, we obtained $125million in additional funding through
a private placement of redeemable, convertible preferred stock and warrants to
seven institutional investors. Halifax Fund LP served as the lead investor of
the private placement.
35 Table of Contents Other investors included a subsidiary of Safeguard Scientifics, Inc.,
currently our largest shareholder.
The preferred stock bears a 5% cumulative annual dividend payable in cash
or common stock and is convertible into common stock at $657 per share. The
number of shares of common stock presently issuable upon conversion of the
preferred stock is 1,901,256, but that number is subject to adjustment
corresponding to adjustments in the conversion price. The preferred stock is
required to be redeemed by us three years after issuance for the amount paid
for the preferred stock plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The warrants are exercisable to purchase an aggregate of 546,615 shares of
common stock at any time after issuance for a period of five years at a price
of $686 per share, which represents 120% of the market price of our common
stock over a designated period prior to closing. The number of shares
issuable upon exercise of the warrants is subject to adjustment
corresponding to adjustments on the exercise price. The Company allocated the total amount
paid by the investors, net of issuance costs, between the preferred stock, the
fair market value of the warrants and the intrinsic value of the conversion
feature of the preferred stock. The fair market value of the warrants was
determined to be approximately $2,295,000 using the Black Scholes
valuation model. The
remaining net amount paid by the investors divided by the number of shares
issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock is the effective conversion
price of the preferred, and the difference between the fair market value of the
common stock on the date of issuance of the preferred and the effective
conversion price is the intrinsic value of the conversion feature, which
amounted to $1,148,421. The fair market value of the warrants and the intrinsic
value of the conversion feature are allocated to paid-in-capital and are
accreted amortizedover the three year period prior to mandatory redemption
of the preferred stock. The issuance costs of approximately
$1,197,000 are also recorded as a
discount to the preferred stock and are accreted over the three-year redemption
period. Under the terms of the transaction documents, the preferred stock is
required to be converted into common stock if the trading price of the common
stock equals or exceeds 175% of the initial conversion price for 20 out of 30
consecutive trading days occurring after the first anniversary of the purchase
of the preferred stock. The conversion price of the preferred stock and the
exercise price of the warrants are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of
certain events, including an adjustment after one year if the current average
trading price of the common stock for a designated period is less than the
conversion or exercise price, respectively, but the amount of the adjusted
price for the one-year adjustment cannot be less than a floor of $40019 per
share. 9Business Segments We operate primarily in one business segment engaged in the development,
manufacture and marketing of an automated cellular imaging system which is
designed to assist physicians in making critical medical decisions. The following table represents business segment information by geographic

10Employee Stock Purchase Plan In April 2001, the Board of Directors approved an employee stock purchase
plan the Purchase Plan which has a total of 1,000,000 shares reserved for
issuance thereunder. All full-time employees are eligible to participate, but
there are various limitations regarding the amount of shares which may be

cannot be less than 85% of the fair market value per share of our common stock
at either the enrollment date or at the last day of the offering period,
whichever is lower. Offerings under the Purchase Plan have a duration of three
months. The first offering period began July1, 2001. During 2001, 18,165
