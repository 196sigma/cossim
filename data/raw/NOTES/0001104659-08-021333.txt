38 REPORT OF ERNST YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Elixir Gaming Technologies,Inc. We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Elixir Gaming Technologies,Inc.
and Subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2007, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for
the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. We were not
engaged to perform an audit of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. Our audit includes consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. In our opinion, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December31,
2007 and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the
year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States. As discussed in Note 16 to
the consolidated financial statements, effective January1, 2007, the
Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. Las Vegas, Nevada

2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders
equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We did
not audit the financial statements of Dolphin Advanced Technologies PTY LTD
Dolphin, a wholly-owned subsidiary, which financial statements reflect total
assets of $5,002,148, and total revenues of $5,645,527 or 18% and 72% of the
respective consolidated totals. Those statements were audited by other auditors
whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates
to the amounts included for Dolphin, is based solely on the report of the other
auditors. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, audits of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. In
our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above, present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December31,
2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the
years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. As
discussed in Note 19 to the financial statements, the Companys 2006 financial
statements have been restated.

TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES The
principal business activity of Elixir Gaming Technologies,Inc. and its
subsidiaries is the owning and leasing of electronic gaming machines placed in
resorts, hotels, cruise ships and other venues through Asia and the developing
and distributing of products related to the gaming and automotive industries.
These products include electronic card shuffling devices, RFID casino chips and
component parts for the automotive industry. Principles of Consolidation These
consolidated financial statements are prepared pursuant to the rulesand
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and include all
adjustments of a normal recurring and nonrecurring nature that are necessary to
fairly present the consolidated results of operations, financial position and
cash flows for each period presented. These
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Elixir Gaming
Technologies,Inc. and all its subsidiaries the Company. Use of Estimates These
consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States US. Accordingly, the Company is required to make
estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on
its historical experience, contract terms, observance of known trends in the
Company and the industry as a whole, and information available from other
outside sources. These estimates affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On a regular basis, the Company evaluates our
estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, product returns,
long-lived assets, inventory obsolescence, stock-based compensation, income
taxes, bad debts, warranty obligations, long-term contracts, contingencies and
litigation. Actual results may differ
from initial estimates. Reclassification Certain
reclassifications have been made to the December31, 2006 balance sheet
and to the statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2006 to
conform to the current year presentation.
In addition, the 2006 financial statements include the correction of a
$30 million error in the presentation of long-term debt as current. Cash and Cash Equivalents All
highly liquid debt instruments with an original maturity of three months or
less are considered cash equivalents.
The Company places its cash and temporary investments with financial
institutions. At December31, 2007,
the Company had deposits with financial institutions in excess of FDIC insured
limits by $681 million. The
Company has restricted cash in the amount of $100,000, in the form of a
certificate of deposit as security on a lease.
This certificate of deposit has been recorded in deposits and other
assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
The restriction will be removed in February2012 upon termination
of the lease. 46 Inventories Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost, determined using the first-in, first-out
method, or market. Cost elements
included in work-in-process and finished goods include raw materials, direct
labor, and manufacturing overhead. The
Company reviews inventory quantities regularly and records charges for excess
and obsolete products. Inventory
provisions total $16 million for the year ended December31, 2007. Consignment Inventory At
the end of the fourth quarter, the Company transferred to our distributor $65,908
of service supplies and parts on consignment which is recorded as
inventory. Revenue is not recognized
until ownership of the product and title passes to the distributor which occurs
upon the distributors use of the products or sales to third-party customers. Gaming Equipment and Systems Gaming
equipment is stated at cost. The Company
depreciates gaming equipment and systems over a five-year useful life to a
minimal salvage value once placed in service. Depreciation of gaming
equipment of $569,926 is included in cost of sales in the consolidated
statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2007. Property and Equipment Property
and equipment Note7 and equipment rented to customers are stated at
cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the useful
lives of the assets currently estimated to be 3-5 years, which, in the case of
leasehold improvements, is limited to the life of the lease and renewal period
so long as renewal is intended. Depreciation of rental and manufacturing
equipment of $445,304 and $677,580 are included in cost of sales in the
consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December31,
2007 and 2006, respectively. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Intangible assets consist of
patents, customer relationships and trademarks and goodwill. They are recorded
at cost and are amortized, except goodwill, on a straight-line basis over the
period of time the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to
future cash flows, which range from 10 to 13years. The straight-line
amortization method is utilized because the Company believes there is not a
more reliably determinable method of reflecting the pattern in which the
economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used up. The Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective January1,
2002. Under SFAS No142,
goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to periodic impairment tests.
Other intangible assets with finite lives, such as patents, customer
relationships and trademarks will continue to be amortized over their useful
lives. The Company measures and
tests goodwill for impairment using the two-step approach under SFAS No142,
at least annually on December31 or more often if there are indicators of
impairment. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value,
an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess. The Companys goodwill is a result of its
acquisition of Dolphin in July2006.
The Companys current year measurement and tests resulted in an
impairment to goodwill of $106 million, which has been 47 recorded in its 2007
consolidated statement of operations.
After giving effect to the impairment, the Companys goodwill as of December31,
2007 is $84,210. In determining the fair value
of Dolphin, the Company applied the income approach using the discounted cash
flow DCFmethod. The Company then compared the implied valuation
multiples of a group of comparable competitor gaming companies under the market
approach to test the reasonableness of its DCF results. The DCF analysis is
based on the present value of two components as follows the sum of the Companys
five year projected cash flows; and
a terminal value assuming a
long-term growth rate. The cash flow estimates are
prepared based on the Companys financial operating plan for Dolphin,
considering historical results and anticipated future performance based on the
Companys expectations regarding product introductions and market
opportunities. The discount rates used to determine the present value of future
cash flows are derived from the weighted average cost-of-capital of a set of
comparable gaming companies, considering the size and specific risks of each
reporting unit. The Companys portfolio of
other definite-life intangibles substantially consists of patents, contracts,
trademarks, developed technology, and customer relationships. The Company
regularly monitors events or changes in circumstances that indicate the
carrying value of these intangibles may not be recoverable or require a
revision to the estimated remaining useful life in accordance with SFAS No144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets. The Companys other intangibles totaled $55
million at December31, 2007 and $89million at December31,
2006 after recording impairments. If an event or change
occurs, the Company estimates future cash flows directly associated with the
use of the intangible to test recoverability and remaining useful lives based
on the forecasted utilization of the asset and expected product revenues. In
developing estimated future cash flows, the Company incorporates assumptions
regarding changes in legal factors, related industry climate, regulatory
actions, contractual factors, operational performance and the companys
strategic business plans, as well as the effects of obsolescence, demand,
competition, and other market conditions.
When the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows
expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of a finite-lived
intangible asset or asset group, the Company then compares the carrying amount
to its current fair value. The Company estimates the fair value using prices
for similar assets, if available, or more typically using a DCF model. The
Company recognizes an impairment loss if the carrying amount is not recoverable
and exceeds its fair value. For the year
ended December31, 2007, the Company incurred an impairment loss of
approximately $26 million related to customer relationships and trademarks of
Dolphin. Impairment testing for
goodwill and other intangibles requires judgment, including the identification
of reporting units, allocation of related goodwill, assignment of corporate
shared assets and liabilities to reporting units, estimated future cash flows,
and determinations of fair value. While the Company believes its estimates of
future revenues and future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions
could materially affect the assessment of useful lives, recoverability and fair
value. If actual future cash flows fall below initial forecasts, the Company
may need to record additional amortization and/or impairment charges. Accounts Receivable and Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are
stated at face value less any allowance for doubtful accounts. Allowances for doubtful accounts are
maintained at levels determined by the Companys management to adequately
provide for uncollectible amounts. In
determining the estimated uncollected amounts, the Company 48 evaluates a combination
of factors, including, but not limited to, activity in the related market,
financial condition of customers, specific customer collection experience and
history of write-offs and collections. Prepaids and Other Current Assets Prepaids and other
current assets consist primarily of prepaid value-added taxes in foreign
countries and deposits. Litigation and Other Contingencies The Company is involved
in various legal matters, litigation and claims of various types in the
ordinary course of its business operations. The Company has regular litigation
reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the
need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The
status of significant claims is summarized in Note18. SFAS No5, Accounting for Contingencies requires that
liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability
has been incurred and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant
management judgment is required related to contingent liabilities and the
outcome of litigation because both are difficult to predict. For contingencies
where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant,
the Company discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an
estimate of the possible loss. Revenue Recognition The
Company recognizes revenue when all of the following have been satisfied persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists the price to the customer is
fixed and determinable delivery has occurred and
any acceptance terms have been fulfilled no significant contractual
obligations remain; and
collection is reasonably
assured. Gaming and Non-Gaming
Product Sales The
Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products to end users upon
shipment against customer contracts or purchase orders. Revenue from shuffler
rentals is recorded at the first of each month in accordance with rental
contract terms. The Company completed it
transition to outsourcing all future sales to third-party distributors during
the fourth quarter 2007 and will no longer record rental income on our table
game products. The
Company recognizes revenue from its sales to independent distributors upon
shipment to the distributor against distributor contracts or purchase orders of
our product. The Company recognizes
revenue on consignment inventory when ownership of the product and title passes
to the distributor which occurs upon the distributors use of the product in
its service organization or to an end user. The
maintenance components that are part of long-term sales contracts are recorded
as deferred revenue and are amortized over the remaining life of the sales
agreement after the initial 90-day warranty as required by the Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue EITF No00-21, Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. The Company provides
currently for estimated warranty repair costs associated with sales contracts.
Although there are no extended warranties offered for its products, the Company
provides for maintenance contracts that are billed and recognized on a monthly
basis. As noted above, the Companys 49 future
sales will be through its third-party distributors and it will no longer offer
long-term sales contracts or service to customers. Therefore, as of December31, 2007, the
Company has no remaining obligation to perform maintenance on gaming and
non-gaming products sold to end users. Although
sales are generally made with no right of return, during 2006, due to product
performance, the Company allowed returns of shuffler products and recorded
sales returns and allowance of $383,000. Participation Revenue The Company earns
recurring revenue by providing customers with electronic gaming machines and
casino management systems, which track game performance and provide statistics
on each installed electronic gaming machine owned by the Company and leased to
venue owners. Revenues are recognized on the contractual terms of the
participation agreements between the Company and the venue owners and are based
on the Companys share of net winnings. The Companys share of joint costs are
recorded in cost of revenue. Freight-Out and Warehousing Costs Freight-out and
warehousing costs are included in cost of product sales in the consolidated
statements of operations. Advertising Expense The cost of advertising
is charged to expense as incurred. The
cost of advertising was $26,081 and $112,723 for the years ended December31,
2007 and 2006, respectively Stock-Based Compensation The Company adopted SFAS No123R,
Share-Based Payment, to account
for all its stock-based compensation beginning January1, 2006, and
elected the modified prospective method of transition. Under the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No123R, it estimates stock-based
compensation on the determined measurement date, generally the award grant date,
and recognizes expense over the requisite service period. Option valuation
models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, and changes in the
assumptions used can materially affect the fair value estimate. Judgment is
required in estimating stock price volatility, forfeiture rates, expected
dividends, and expected terms that options remain outstanding. Stock-based
compensation expense totaled $59 million and $13 million for the years ended December31,
2007 and 2006, respectively, and is included in selling, general and
administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 13 for additional information
regarding these assumptions. Contract Acquisition Fees The
transactions under the Securities Purchase and Product Participation Agreement
Participation Agreement are accounted for pursuant to EITF 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than
Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services. In accordance with EITF 96-18, the Company
valued the initial issuance of common shares based on the market price of its
stock and warrants based on a Black-Scholes option-pricing model calculation on
the measurement date, which occurred when the first performance milestone was
achieved. The fair value of the common
shares was initially capitalized in accordance with SFAS 91, Accounting for Non-Refundable Fees and Costs Associated with
Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Directs of Leases, and
the fair value of the warrants was deferred. 50 In accordance with SFAS No144,
the Company tested this asset for recoverability using present value techniques
based on estimated future cash flows and accordingly recorded a charge to
contract acquisition fees of $778 million in the statement of operations for
the year ended December31, 2007. Immediately following the
initial closing of the transactions under the Participation Agreement, Elixir
Group became a related party and, in accordance with SFAS No13 Accounting for Leases, initial direct costs between related
parties should not be capitalized.
Accordingly, upon the achievement of the future performance milestones
by Elixir Group, the remaining shares of common stock to be issued and future
vesting of warrants will be expensed as incurred. Elixir Group acheived the
second performance milestone in September 2007 and accordingly the Company recorded
additional contract acquisition fees of $931 million. Research and Development Research
and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Employee related costs associated with
product development are included in research and development costs. Income Taxes The Company is subject to
income taxes in the U.S. including federal and state and several foreign
jurisdictions in which it operates. Deferred income tax balances reflect the
effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities and their tax basis and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to
be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that deferred tax
assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance
to the extent the Company believes a portion will not be realized. The Company
considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of
its deferred tax assets, including its recent cumulative earnings experience
and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the
carry-forward periods available to the Company for tax reporting purposes, and
other relevant factors. Significant judgment is
required in evaluating its tax positions and determining its provision for
income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many
transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is
uncertain. Effective January1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions
of FIN No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes and Interpretation of FASB Statement No109,
which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax
positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS No109. The first step is
to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of
available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will
be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation
processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest
amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate
settlement.The Company considers many factors when evaluating and
estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic
adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. We are subject to income tax
examination by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate. There are
currently no income tax returns under examination by the Internal Revenue
Service or any other major tax authorities. Loss Per Share Basic
loss per share is computed by dividing the reported net loss by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. There is
no difference in diluted loss per share from basic loss per share as the
assumed exercise of common stock equivalents would have an anti-dilutive effect
due to losses. 51 Foreign Currency Translations and
Transactions The
functional currency of the Companys international subsidiaries is the local
currency. For these subsidiaries, the
Company translates the assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at
the balance sheet date and income and expense accounts at average exchange
rates during the year. Resulting
currency translation adjustments are recorded directly to accumulated other
comprehensive income within stockholders equity. Gains and losses resulting from transactions
in non-functional currencies are recorded in operations. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December2007,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No141R, Business Combinations. SFAS No141Rreplaces
SFAS No141, Business Combinations,
but retains the requirement that the purchase method of accounting for
acquisitions be used for all business combinations. SFAS No141Rexpands
on the disclosures previously required by SFAS No141, better defines the
acquirer and the acquisition date in a business combination, and establishes
principles for recognizing and measuring the assets acquired including
goodwill, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interests in the
acquired business. SFAS No141Ralso requires an acquirer to
record an adjustment to income tax expense for changes in valuation allowances
or uncertain tax positions related to acquired businesses. SFAS No141Ris
effective for all business combinations with an acquisition date in the first
annual period following December15, 2008; early adoption is not
permitted. The Company will adopt this statement as of January1, 2009.
Management is currently evaluating the impact SFAS No141Rwill
have on its consolidated financial statements. In December2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No160, Non-Controlling
Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of ARB No51.
This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership
interest in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It also clarifies that a non-controlling
interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity
that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements.
SFAS No160 changes the way the consolidated income statement is
presented by requiring consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that
include the amount attributable to both the parent and the non-controlling
interests. The statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide
sufficient disclosure that clearly identify and distinguish between the
interest of the parent and those of the non-controlling owners. This statement
is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2008. The
adoption of SFAS No160 is not expected to have a material impact on the
Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September2006,
the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair
Value Measurements, which clarifies the definition of fair value,
establishes guidelines for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures
regarding fair value measurements. SFAS No157 does not require any new
fair value measurements and eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in
various prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS No157 will be effective
for the Company on January1, 2008. In February2008, the FASB issued
FASB Staff Position FSP SFAS No157-2 Effective
Date of FASB Statement No157 that deferred the effective date
of SFAS No157 for one year for certain non-financial assets and
non-financial liabilities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
adopting SFAS No157 on our financial position, cash flows, and results
of operations. In February2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair
Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No159
permits entities to choose to measure at fair value many financial instruments
and certain other items that are not currently required to be measured at fair
value. 52 Subsequent changes in
fair value for designated items will be required to be reported in earnings in
the current period. SFAS No159 also establishes presentation and
disclosure requirements for similar types of assets and liabilities measured at
fair value. SFAS No159 is effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The Company currently
assessing the effect of implementing this guidance, which depends on the nature
and extent of items elected to be measured at fair value, upon initial
application of the standard on January1, 2008. NOTE 2. DOLPHIN ACQUISITION The Company acquired Dolphin Advanced Technologies Pty Ltd
Dolphin, a manufacturer of plastic injection molded products, on July12,
2006. Dolphin manufactures traditional and high frequency RFID casino chips as
well as non-gaming products including automotive components and medical
components. The results of operations of
Dolphin have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the
acquisition date. The Company acquired Dolphin pursuant to a share sale

Impairment of Intangible Assets and Goodwill In accordance with SFAS No142 and SFAS No144,
the Company reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual
basis December31 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Dolphin, which was acquired in July2006,
has not met expectations to date due to a number of factors including the loss
of a general manager and sales staff in early 2007, and, to date, the Company
has not found suitable replacements. As
such, the Company believed that original financial forecasts needed to be
adjusted downward and a test for impairment was warranted. In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company performed
a two-step impairment test which compared the fair value of a reporting unit
with its carry amount, including goodwill and allocating the fair value to all
the assets and liabilities of Dolphin as if the reporting unit had been
acquired in a business combination.
Based on its review, the Company recorded an impairment to goodwill of
$106 million. The Company amortizes definite-life intangible
assets, such as customer relationships, patents and trademarks on the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The Company assessed the potential impairment
of intangible assets subject to amortization based upon the factors identified
above. The Company determined that the
carrying value of the Dolphin customer relationships and trademarks 58 for the non-gaming products segment would be
recoverable but not recoverable for the gaming products segment, based upon the
Companys calculation of the assets fair value based on the discounted projected
net cash flows expected to result from those assets, including any eventual
disposition. Accordingly, the Company
recorded impairments to customer relationships and trademarks of the gaming
products segment of $26 million for the year ended December31, 2007. The following table summarizes the goodwill and
intangible impairments

Impairment charges have been presented in the

OTHER ASSETS Prepaid
Commissions On
January25, 2007, the Company issued warrants to purchase up to 16,000,000
shares of its common stock the 2006 Warrants to Elixir Group, which at the
time was its Asian distributor of table game products, as an incentive to meet
certain sales targets. These warrants
were accounted for in accordance with the EITF No96-18. The 2006 Warrants had a fair market value of
$6,147,000 as of January25, 2007 and were classified in the Companys
balance sheet as prepaid commissions subject to amortization to commission
expense at a rate of 8% of the gross revenue generated by the distributor. In
September2007, the Company conducted the initial closing of the
transactions under the Participation Agreement between it and Elixir
Group. In accordance with the
Participation Agreement, the Company agreed that upon the initial placement of
1,000 electronic gaming machines with gaming operators identified by Elixir
Group, we would reduce by $100 the exercise price of 10 million of the 2006
Warrants, which originally had exercise prices ranging from $265 per share to
$550 per share. When the cumulative
number of electronic gaming machines under contract reached 2,000 units and the
cumulative number of electronic gaming machines placed in operation reaches
1,000 units, the Company agreed to further reduce by $100 the exercise prices
of the 10 million warrants. When the cumulative number of electronic gaming
machines under contract reaches 3,000 units and the cumulative number of
electronic gaming machines placed in operation reaches 2,000 units, the Company
will further reduce by $100 the exercise prices of the 10 million 2006
Warrants. As of the date of this report, the Company has reduced the exercise
price of the 10 million 2006 Warrants by $200 based on the achievement of the
related performance milestones. In
accordance with SFAS No123R, the reduction in exercise price constituted
a modification in terms of the 2006 Warrants and required a recalculation of
fair value. The modification increased
the fair value of the warrants by $227 million bringing the unamortized balance
of the prepaid sales commission to $288 million. Per SFAS No144, a
long-lived asset asset group shall be tested for recoverability whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be
recoverable including an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the
amount originally expected for the acquisition. The
Company estimated fair value using present value techniques based on estimates
of cash flows. In accordance with SFAS No144,
an impairment loss shall be recognized if the carrying amount of an 59 intangible
asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. After
an impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of the
intangible asset shall be its new accounting basis. Based upon the above, the Company recorded an
impairment to the asset of $273 million and included the amount in loss from
operations in our consolidated statement of operations and deficit. As of December31, 2007, the Company had
prepaid commissions of $14 million. Deposits and Other Assets Deposits and other assets

NOTE 12. SECURITIES
PURCHASE AND PRODUCT PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT On
June12, 2007, the Company entered into the Participation Agreement with
Elixir Group Limited Elixir Group. Pursuant to the Participation Agreement,
the Company agreed to issue to Elixir Group its common shares and warrants to
purchase its 61 common
shares, subject to Elixir Groups identification of venues located in the
general Asia region for the placement of electronic gaming machines with venue
owners on the Companys behalf. The
Company agreed to place electronic gaming machines with venue owners pursuant
to lease agreements between it and the venue owners under what are commonly
referred to as revenue sharing arrangements, which provide for the Company to
receive variable rental payments for its electronic gaming machines as
lessor. Elixir Group also agreed to sell
to the Company the electronic gaming machines to be placed under the lease
agreements at its cost plus fifteen percent 15%. According to the terms of
the Participation Agreement, Elixir Group has the right to earn-in an equity
interest in the Company based on the achievement of various performance
milestones in terms of athe cumulative number of electronic gaming
machines contracted to be placed and leased pursuant to lease agreements
entered into between the Company and the venue owners sourced and identified by
Elixir Group the gaming machines under contract and bthe cumulative
number of electronic gaming machines physically placed by the Company and in
operation in the gaming premises of venue owners pursuant to the lease
agreements the gaming machines in operation. On
September10, 2007, the Company conducted an initial closing of the
transactions under the Participation Agreement. At the initial closing, the
Company issued to Elixir Group, 25,000,000 common shares of the Company common
stock based on Elixir Groups placement of electronic gaming machines and
warrants, with an exercise price of $265 per share, to purchase up to
88,000,000 additional shares of the Companys common stock. The warrants vest
and first become exercisable based on the achievement of certain performance
milestones with respect to the number of gaming machines under contract and
gaming machines in operation. On September13, 2007, the Company issued an
additional 15,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock to Elixir Group
based on Elixir Groups placement of additional electronic gaming
machines. Elixir Group is entitled to
earn a total of 55,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock inclusive of
the 25,000,000 shares issued at the initial closing and the 15,000,000 shares
issued on September13, 2007 and the 88,000,000 warrants will vest and
become exercisable subject to achieving the following performance milestones
with respect to the cumulative number of gaming machines under contract and
gaming machines in operation.

In
addition to the above, the Company agreed that upon the initial placement of
1,000 gaming machines with venue owners identified by Elixir Group, the Company
would reduce by $100 the exercise price of all warrants other than 6,000,000
common share warrants priced at $265 sold to Elixir Group pursuant to a
securities purchase agreement entered into in October2006 the 2006
Warrants. When the cumulative number of gaming machines under contract
reaches 2,000 units and the cumulative number of gaming machines in operation
reaches 1,000 units, the Company agreed to further reduce by $100 the exercise
prices of the 2006 Warrants. When the cumulative number of gaming machines
under contract reaches 3,000 units and the cumulative number of gaming machines
in operation reaches 2,000 units, the Company will further reduce by $100 the
exercise prices of the 2006 Warrants. 62 In
connection with the initial closing of the transactions under the Participation
Agreement, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with Elixir
Group. The registration rights agreement, as amended, requires the Company to file
a selling shareholder registration statement with the SEC, within 30days
following the initial closing of the transactions under the Participation
Agreement, for purposes of registering the resale of the shares of the Companys
common stock issued to Elixir Group pursuant to the transaction, including all
shares that are issued, or may be issued, upon exercise of the warrants.
Pursuant to the registration rights agreement, as amended, the holders of the
common stock are also entitled to certain demand and piggyback registration
rights. In conjunction with a Securities
Amendment and Exchange Agreement the Exchange Agreement entered into with
Elixir Group in October2007, Elixir Group agreed to defer its
registration rights for one year see Note 14. The
transactions under the Participation Agreement are accounted for pursuant to
EITF 96-18. In accordance with EITF 96-18, we valued the initial 25,000,000 common
shares and 88,000,000 unvested warrants at fair value on the measurement date
which occurred when the first performance milestone was achieved. The common shares were initially capitalized
in a manner consistent with the guidance provided in SFAS No91, Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating
or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases An Amendment of FASB
Statements No13, 60, and 65 and a Rescission of FASB Statement No17,
and fair value of the warrants was deferred.
The fair value of the common shares totaled $778 million and the fair
value of the warrants totaled $1600 million. In accordance with SFAS No144,
the Company tested this asset for recoverability using present value techniques
based on estimated future cash flows and accordingly recorded an impairment of
$778 million of contract acquisition fees in the consolidated statement of
operations for the year ended December31, 2007. The
initial closing of the transactions under the Participation Agreement,
including the issuance of the Companys common shares and warrants to Elixir Group,
were approved by the Companys shareholders at a special meeting of
shareholders held on September10, 2007.
Based on the aforementioned common stock issuances, as of December31,
2007, the Company had 114,914,934 shares of its common stock issued and
outstanding, of which 45,800,000 or 3986% were held by Elixir Group
including 1,000,000 shares purchased by Elixir Group in January2007 and
4,800,000 shares issued in the warrant exchange transaction in December2007
see Note 14. Immediately
following the initial closing of the transactions under the Participation
Agreement Elixir Group became a related party see Note 15 and in accordance
with SFAS No13, initial direct costs between related parties should not
be capitalized. Accordingly, upon the
achievement of the second performance milestone by Elixir Group on September13,
2007, the 15,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock that were issued
valued at $531 million based on market price of our stock and the vesting of
the 22,000,000 warrants valued at $400 million based on a Black-Scholes
option-pricing model calculation see Note 13 for valuation assumptions was
recorded as contract acquisition fees in the consolidated statement of
operations for the year ended December31, 2007. In
October2007, the Company entered into the Exchange Agreement with Elixir
Group, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to Elixir Group up to 312
million shares of our common stock in exchange for Elixir Groups cancellation
of up to 78 million of the 88 million warrants it received under the
Participation Agreement. At the annual
meeting of shareholders held on December17, 2007, a majority of our voting shares
excluding shares held by Elixir Group voted to approve the Exchange
Agreement. Elixir immediately
surrendered 12 million vested warrants in exchange for 48 million shares of
our common stock. In accordance with
SFAS No123R, this exchange represented a modification of the original
issuance of the warrants. We re-valued
the shares based upon the fair value at the date of 63 modification. The fair value of the modified award was less
then the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification
thus in accordance with SFAS No. 123R, no additional costs were recorded. NOTE
13. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION Options The
Company has two stock options plans: the Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Option
Plan and the Amended and Restated 1999 Directors Stock Option Plan the Stock
Option Plans, through which 15,000,000 shares and 300,000 shares are
authorized, respectively. As of December31, 2007, there were options for the
purchase of 3,218,369 shares of common stock issued under the two plans. In
May2007, stock options for the purchase of 5,000,000 of common stock were
granted by the board of directors pursuant to the initial closing of the
transactions under the Participation Agreement to certain employees and
non-employees. Each option had an
exercise price of $290 per share and will vest over a three-year period and
have a five-year term. The fair value of
the shares is $110 million and the Company recorded expense of $11 million
representing the vesting of options over the requisite service period for the
year ended December31, 2007. A
summary of the Stock Option Plans as of December31, 2007, and changes
during the year then ended, is presented below

The
weighted average fair value at the date of grant for options granted during
2007 and 2006 as described above was $159 per share in 2007 and $151 per
share in 2006. During
the year ended December31, 2007, options with a fair value of $37
million vested, and options with an intrinsic value of $39 million were
exercised. The
options outstanding at December31, 2006 included 1,050,000 options that vested
and became exercisable upon a change in control of the Company. The initial closing of the transactions under
the Participation Agreement with Elixir Group represented a change of control,
resulting in the vesting of these options. 64 Recognition and Measurement The
fair value of each stock-based award to employees and non-employee directors,
is estimated on the measurement date which generally is the grant date using
the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. Option valuation models require
the input of highly subjective assumptions, and changes in assumptions used can
materially affect the fair value estimates. The Company estimates the expected
life of the award by taking into consideration the vesting period, contractual
term, historical exercise data, expected volatility, blackout periods and other
relevant factors. Volatility is estimated by evaluating the Companys
historical volatility data. The risk-free interest rate at the date of grant is
based on U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates for a period approximating the
expected life of the award. The Company historically has not paid dividends,
nor does it expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future; therefore, the
expected dividend rate is zero. The
following table summarizes the range of assumptions utilized in the
Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model for the valuation of stock options and
warrants granted during the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006

The
Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all service-based
awards with graded vesting schedules on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period for the entire award. Initial accruals of compensation
expense are based on the estimated number of shares for which requisite service
is expected to be rendered. Estimates are revised if subsequent information
indicates that forfeitures will differ from previous estimates, and the
cumulative effect on compensation cost of a change in the estimated forfeitures
is recognized in the period of the change. For
awards with service conditions and graded vesting that were granted prior to
the adoption of SFAS No123R, the Company estimates the requisite service
period and the number of shares expected to vest, and recognizes compensation
expense for each tranche on a straight-line basis over the estimated requisite
service period. Warrants A

see Note 9. 88 million warrants granted to Elixir Group in September2007,
of which 22 million vested in September2007 see Note 12. 1,625,000 warrants sold to an institutional investor in March
2007 see Note 14. The
amount recorded as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations for
the year ended December31, 2007 related to warrants issued in fiscal 2007
was $673 million. NOTE 14. EQUITY
TRANSACTIONS On October19, 2007, the Company entered into a securities
purchase agreement and a registration rights agreement with certain accredited
investors for the private placement of 15,000,000 shares of its common stock at
a price of $350 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $525 million. The purchase and sale of the common shares
closed on October25, 2007. The securities purchase agreement includes
customary representations, warranties, and covenants by the investors and the
Company and an indemnity from the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the
registration rights agreement, the Company agreed to cause a resale
registration statement covering the shares to be filed within 30 days after
closing. On
September7, 2007, the Company entered into a Waiver and Amendment to
Warrants the Amendment with four investment funds managed by Bricoleur
Capital Management, of San Diego, California the Bricoleur Funds. The
Amendment modified certain terms of the notes and warrants the Company issued
to the Bricoleur Funds pursuant to an 8% Senior Secured Note Purchase Agreement
dated May1, 2006 the Note Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the Note
Purchase Agreement, the Bricoleur Funds purchased from the Company 8% senior
secured notes the Notes in the principal amount of $13,000,000 and warrants
Warrants to purchase up to 2,600,000 shares of the Companys common stock
at an exercise price of $200 per share.
The fair value of the warrants at issuance was $3,380,000, using the
relative fair value method, and recorded as a debt discount. The
Notes included a change in control provision that would have allowed the
Bricoleur Funds to accelerate the payment of the outstanding principal amount
under the Notes upon the issuance of the Companys equity securities pursuant
to the Participation Agreement dated June12, 2007 between the Company and
Elixir Group. In addition, 50% of the net proceeds from certain equity
issuances by the Company were to be used to reduce the principal balance of the
Notes and, accordingly, the Company owed the Bricoleur Funds $825,000 in
principal as a result of an equity issuance by the Company in September2007. Pursuant
to the Amendment, the Company agreed with the Bricoleur Funds to aamend
the Warrants to add net exercise provisions to the Warrants, beffect a
net exercise of Warrants representing the right to purchase 2,275,000 shares of
the Companys common stock at a mutually agreed value of $350 per share for
purposes of effecting such net exercise, resulting in the issuance of 975,000
shares of the Companys common stock to the Bricoleur Funds in exchange for the
cancellation of 2,275,000 Warrants, cwaive any application of the
change in control provision of the Notes with respect to the transactions under
the Participation Agreement, and ddefer the $825,000 in principal
amount currently owed by the Company and allow the Company to pay such amount
in accordance with the payment terms of the Notes as though the September2007
equity issuance had not occurred. In
accordance with SFAS No123R, the amendment has been treated as a
modification to the equity instrument and incremental compensation costs
measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value 66 of
the modified award over the original fair value. The estimated fair value of the award as
modified was less than the original estimated fair value, and accordingly,
there was no accounting effect due to the modification of the terms. On
May3, 2007, the Company entered into an agreement with four investors for
the Companys sale of 600,000 shares of its common stock for the aggregate
price of $1,650,000 $275 per share paid in cash. On
March28, 2007, the Company completed the sale of 1,625,000 shares of the
Companys common stock and warrants to purchase 1,625,000 shares of common
stock to an institutional investor for the aggregate price of $4,306,250. The
warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of $265 per share for a period
of five years beginning on March28, 2007.
The relative fair value of the stock and warrants were classified in
equity in accordance with Accounting Principals Board APB No14, Accounting for Convertible Debt Issued with Stock Purchase Warrants
and EITF 00-19, Accounting for Derivative Financial
Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in a Companys Own Stock.
The Company also granted the investor certain registration rights requiring the
Company to file a selling shareholder registration statement with the SEC, for
purposes of registering the resale of the shares of the Companys common stock
issued to the investor pursuant to the transaction, including all shares that
are issued, or may be issued, upon exercise of the warrants. The Company was required
to pay the investor a cash penalty in the event of a failure to file the
registration statement by June15, 2007 or the Companys failure to
achieve and maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement as
provided in the registration rights agreement, however the investor agreed to
waive the penalty for failure to file by June15, 2007 and to extend the
filing deadline to November23, 2007.
The Company complied with the filing date and no penalty was assessed. NOTE 15. RELATED
PARTY TRANSACTIONS On September13, 2007, the second performance
milestone was achieved by Elixir Group and 15,000,000 shares of the Companys
common stock were issued and 22,000,000 of the 88,000,000 warrants to purchase
common stock vested. As this transaction
was between related parties and in accordance with SFAS No13, and SFAS No91,
the fair value of the common shares and the vested portion of the warrants were
recorded as expense when incurred.
Accordingly, the Company recorded $931 million of contract acquisition
fees in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31,
2007. During the year ended December31, 2007, the
Company purchased $398 million of electronic gaming machines and systems from
Elixir Group, at cost plus fifteen percent 15%. At December31, 2007, the Company had
accounts payable of $296 million due to Elixir Group for these purchases. The payables have cash terms of fifty percent
50% due upon placement and the balance 45 days thereafter with no required
interest payments. The Company recorded
sales of $193,700 to Elixir Group after becoming related parties. NOTE 16. INCOME TAXES The components of the provision for income taxes are as follows

Some prior year amounts in
the table above have been reclassified between individual lines to
appropriately reflect the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company adopted the
provisions of FINNo48 on January1, 2007. As a result of the
implementation of FINNo48, the Company determined that the
adoption did not have a material impact to its financial statements. A reconciliation of the
beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows 
Balance at January1, 2007

Balance at December31,

99,966
The amount of uncertain tax
benefits at December 31, 2007 that would affect the effective income tax rate
if recognized is $99,966. The Company files income tax
returns in the U.S., various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is
subject to federal, state and local, or foreign income tax examinations by tax
authorities in jurisdictions which it operates. The Company is not presently
under examination by any major tax jurisdiction. The Companys 2003 to 2006 domestic income
tax returns remain subject to examination by the IRS and the Companys 2003 to
2006 Australian income tax returns remain subject to examination by the
Australian Tax Office. The Company recognizes
interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in the
provision for income taxes on the statement of operations. At December31,
2007, the date of adoption, the Company did not have any interest or penalties
accrued in the balance sheet or statement of operations. The Company does not expect a significant
increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months. 69 Domestic
operating loss carryforwards were $1590 million and $972 million for the
years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which are subject to
limitations under Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code. These domestic
operating losses begin to expire in 2016.
During 2007, the Company wrote off $416 million of domestic operating
losses that it determined would expire as a result of limitations under Section382
of the Internal Revenue Code. Operating
loss carryforwards of the foreign subsidiaries were $01 million and $05
million for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 respectively, which
begin to expire in 2008. At
December31, 2007 and 2006, there was a valuation allowance of $588
million and $313 million, respectively, provided on the domestic and foreign
operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets because management
believes these assets do not meet the more likely than not criteria for
recognition under SFAS No109. As
of December31, 2007 there were no material undistributed earnings of
subsidiaries. NOTE 17. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES In accordance with SFAS 146,
Accounting for Cost Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities, the Company incurred restructuring charges of
$14 million for severance wages and benefits based upon contractual and other
agreements with employees which only includes charges for termination benefits
measured at the estimated fair value at the termination date. It does not include charges for services yet
to be rendered. The total reduction in
headcount is 21 people. On September10,
2007, as part of the initial closing of the transactions under the
Participation Agreement with Elixir Group, the Company announced a change in
executive management. As part of the
restructuring, in October2007 the Company gave termination notice to all
service technicians, inventory management personnel, some regulatory compliance
personnel and some administrative staff.
Subsequent to December31, 2007 all of these costs were paid. Restructuring charges of $14 million are
reported in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31,
2007. NOTE 18. COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES Leases The Company is obligated
under non-cancelable leases for office and warehouse facilities expiring in
2011 and 2009, respectively. The Company also leases office space in other
locations including China, Australia and Philippines and certain office
equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with remaining terms in excess
of one year. In March2008, the
Company moved its headquarters and entered in a new non-cancelable lease for
the new office space. In February2008,
the Company entered into a sublease for the balance of the remaining term on
the previous office space. The proceeds
from the sublease have been netted against the future minimum lease payments. 70 Future minimum lease payment
commitments, net of sublease proceeds and including scheduled escalation
provisions as of December31, 2007, under the leases are as follows

expense on all operating leases was $918,215 and $891,989 for years ended December31,
2007 and 2006, respectively. Legal Matters The Company is a party to
certain claims, legal actions, and complaints, including a patent infringement
action between the Company and one of its main competitors and the sales tax
dispute discussed in the following paragraph. The Company cannot estimate the
probable loss, if any, or predict the likely outcome of any such matters and
accordingly, no accrual has been made for them. On October5, 2004, Shuffle Master filed a patent infringement
action in the United States District Court, District of Nevada Case No.CV-S-04-1373-JCM-LRL
claiming that the use, importation and offering for sale of our PokerOne
shuffler infringed Shuffle Masters United States Patent, No6,655,684.
The Company responded by denying Shuffle Masters claim of patent infringement.
On April27, 2007, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment and on February1,
2008, the District Court granted the Companys motion for summary judgment on
all patent infringement claims. Although
the District Courts order is subject to appeal by Shuffle Master, the Company
believes that the order effectively settles the issue of infringement in the
Companys favor. On February15,
2008, the Company delivered a demand to Shuffle Master for $30 million in
damages for the wrongful injunction it obtained in 2004. The Company also filed a motion in District
Court to recover its attorneys fees in the litigation. The Company intends to vigorously pursue
collection of the $30 million bond and its attorneys fees from Shuffle
Master, however, there can be no assurances the Company will be successful in
doing so. On
October5, 2007, William Purton filed an action against the Company in the
Supreme Court of Victoria at Melbourne, Australia claiming he is owed monies
under the July2006 Share Sale Agreement by which the Company acquired
Dolphin. In addition, Purton is claiming
he is owed money for an independent contractor agreement that he claims he was
offered. The Company has filed a
counterclaim. The matter is proceeding
toward trial and the Company will vigorously defend its position. Sales
Tax Audit In February2004, the State of Nevada initiated a sales/use tax
audit of the Companys equipment lessors. As of the date of this filing, the
State of Nevada has not made a determination if there has been a shortfall in
the payment of the sales/use tax. If the State of Nevada determines that the
sales of the products to the equipment lessors is the level at which sales/use
tax should have been collected, liability of the leasing companies could be
passed on to the Company and may not be recoverable. The outcome could range
from a refund of $144,000 to a potential liability with interest and penalties
of up to $500,000. However, no probable loss, if any can be estimated. Accordingly, no accrual has been made for any
possible losses in connection with this matter. 71 NOTE 19. RESTATEMENT TO
THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company restated its fiscal 2006
consolidated financial statements by way of Amendment No. 1 to the Companys
Form 10-KSB for the year ended December 31, 2006 filed with the SEC on November
13, 2007. The restatement was to correct
errors that resulted from its failure to record debt issuance costs related to
warrants issued in connection with debt financings completed during the year
ended December 31, 2006. The errors relate to the accounting treatment
that the Company failed to apply with respect to warrants issued by it in
connection with certain debt financings the majority of which were issued
during the second quarter of 2006. In Amendment No. 1, the issuance
of warrants issued with debt were recorded as a debt discount in the total
amount of $3,380,000 and are being amortized as interest expense over the life
of the debt. Also by way of Amendment No. 1, the Company reclassified
$4,300,000 from goodwill to other identifiable intangible assets and reversed
certain warrant related expenses, and recorded a tax liability in the amount of
$18 million for the differences between the assigned values and the tax basis
of recognized assets in a business combination and corrected the contingent
liability by $301,000. Also, the Company had originally recorded in its 2006
fiscal year consolidated financial statements certain expenses related to
warrants issued during 2005 and 2004. In
Amendment No. 1, those warrant related expenses were reversed from the 2006
consolidated financial statements. Following is a reconciliation of loss from
operations as originally reported to the restated amounts reported in the 2006
consolidated financial statements included in Amendment No1 to the
Companys Form 10-KSB/A for the year ended December 31, 2006 filed with the SEC
on November 13, 2007.

Item 5. CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES. a
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures. Our
management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures pursuant to Rule13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended the Exchange Act. The term disclosure controls and
procedures refers to the controls and procedures of our company that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange
Commissions rulesand forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures. In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition,
the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its
judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures
relative to their costs. In
late January2008, we became aware that a significant number of gaming
machines were purchased by us and placed in various gaming venues throughout
Cambodia in the fourth quarter of 2007 without proper reporting to our
management and other personnel within our finance and accounting
departments. This represented a break
down in the operation of our internal control over fixed asset acquisitions in
that purchase orders and shipping documents were not properly obtained and
forwarded to accounting to ensure proper financial statement recordation in a
timely manner. These fixed asset
acquisitions in Cambodia represent approximately $20 million of acquisition
costs. This represented a material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting at December31,
2007; however we mitigated the risk associated with this material weakness by
performing a full count of these fixed assets in February2008 and
verifying through examination of shipping documents and invoices that these
assets were purchased by us and placed in the gaming venues prior to December31,
2007. Notwithstanding our subsequent
verification that the gaming machines were acquired during fiscal 2007, based
on the foregoing, our management, including, our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective as of December31, 2007. b Changes in internal
control over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2007 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting. c Managements report on
internal control over financial reporting. Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. Management conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework in Internal Control 73 Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Management completed its
evaluation of effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in
March2008. Based on its
evaluation, management concluded that we had a material weakness in our
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007 due to
the breakdown of internal control over fixed asset acquisitions described
above. The breakdown of internal control
over fixed asset acquisitions was attributable to the rapid growth of our
gaming participation business in Asia and our lack of infrastructure in place
to train new personnel on our established procedures for procuring fixed
assets. During the first quarter of
2008, we have hired a business process director, who is responsible for
documenting and training personnel on the proper procedures required for game
placements and movements between venues.
We will continue to monitor and to test our internal controls to ensure
the material weakness has been cured. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our
registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Our managements report was
not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to
temporary rulesof the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us
to provide only managements report in this annual report. Item 1.
