49 Table of Contents   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of VNUS Medical
Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the index under a1 present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of VNUS Medical
Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31,
2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
index appearing under a2 presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read
in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The
Companys management is responsible for these financial
statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
financial statements, on the financial statement schedule and on
the Companys internal control over financial reporting
based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.   As discussed in Note7 to the consolidated financial
statements, effective January1, 2006, the Company changed
the manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

Note1
The
Company   VNUS Medical Technologies, Inc. the Company is a
leading provider of medical devices for the minimally invasive
treatment of venous reflux disease, a progressive condition
caused by incompetent vein valves in the legs. In late 1998, the
Company introduced its
Closure
system in Europe. In late 1999, the Company introduced its
Closure system in the United States. In 2005, the Company
introduced the
ClosureRFStm
line of products for the minimally invasive treatment of
perforator and tributary vein reflux. The Company introduced the
ClosureFASTtm
catheter for the minimally invasive treatment of venous reflux
disease in the United States in the first quarter of 2007, and
internationally in the second quarter of 2007.   The Company was incorporated in Delaware on January4,
1995. The Company has funded its operations through the issuance
of convertible preferred stock and common stock, and through
cash provided from operations. During 1999, the Company
commenced volume shipment of its product and emerged from the
development stage. Although no longer in the development stage,
the Company continues to be subject to certain risks common to
companies in similar stages of development, including its
dependence on a limited product line; limited manufacturing,
marketing and sales experience; reliance on key individuals;
potential competition from larger, more established companies
and uncertainty of future profitability. The Company completed
its initial public offering of common stock in October 2004.   
Note2
Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   Principles of consolidation and basis of
presentation.The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.   Foreign Currency Translation.We transact
business in various foreign currencies. In general, the
functional currency of a foreign operation is the local
countrys currency except for our German subsidiary, whose
functional currency is the United States dollar. Non-functional
currency monetary balances are re-measured into the functional
currency of the subsidiary with any related gain or loss
recorded in other income, net, in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations. Assets and liabilities of operations
outside the United States, for which the functional currency is
the local currency, are translated into United States dollars
using fiscal year-end exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are
translated at the average exchange rates in effect during each
fiscal month during the year. The effects of foreign currency
translation adjustments are included in stockholders
equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.   For the years ended 2007, 2006 and 2005 foreign currency
transaction gains or losses included in other income, net, in
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were
$376,000 gain, $208,000 gain and $148,000 loss, respectively.   Use of Estimates.The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.   Reclassifications.Certain amounts in the 2006
and 2005 financial statements have been reclassified to conform
with the 2007 presentation.   Net Income Loss Per Share.The Company
computes basic net income loss per share by dividing net
income loss available to common stockholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Basic net income loss per share excludes the dilutive effect
of potential stock including stock   
55 Table of Contents   VNUS
MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.   NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   options and restricted stock units and warrants. Diluted income
per share reflects the dilution of potential common shares
outstanding during the period. In computing diluted income per
share, the Company adjusts share count by assuming that all
in-the-money options and restricted stock units are exercised
and that the Company repurchases shares with the proceeds of
these hypothetical exercises. The Company further assumes that
any unamortized deferred stock-based compensation is also used
to repurchase shares. In determining the hypothetical shares
repurchased, the Company uses the average stock price for the
period.   The following table sets forth the computation of basic and
diluted net income loss attributable to common stockholders
per common share in thousands, except per share data

considers all highly-liquid investment instruments with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. As of December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the
Company held its cash and cash equivalents in checking accounts,
money market accounts and investment accounts with several
financial institutions. Some accounts exceeded FDIC insurance
limits. Certain accounts were held with financial institutions
outside the United States of America in Western European
countries.   Short-Term Investments.Short-term
investments, which include money market instruments, debt
instruments of the U.S.government and its agencies and
high-quality corporate issuers, are classified as
available-for-sale and reported at fair value using the specific
identification method. Unrealized gains and losses are excluded
from earnings and reported as a component of other comprehensive
income loss. Additionally, the Company assesses whether an
other-than-temporary impairment loss on its investments has
occurred due to declines in fair value or other market
conditions. The Company has not identified any such impairment
losses to date.   
56 Table of Contents   VNUS
MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.   NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Fair Value of Financial Instruments.The
Companys financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments, prepaid expenses and other
current assets, accrued liabilities and accounts payable are
carried at cost, which approximates fair value because of the
short-term nature of those instruments.   Inventories.Inventories are stated at the
lower of cost or market, cost being determined using the
first-in,
first-out method. Lower of cost or market is evaluated by
considering obsolescence, excessive levels of inventory,
deterioration and other factors.   Shipping and Handling Costs In accordance with the
Emerging Issues Task Force EITF issue
00-10,
Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs, the
Company includes shipping and handling revenues in net sales and
shipping and handling costs in cost of goods sold.   Property and Equipment.Property and equipment
are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the assets, or the lease term of the respective assets, if
applicable. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the
straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful
life of the asset or the term of the lease.   The depreciation and amortization period for property and
equipment categories are as follows   	
Furniture and fixtures   3years   Computer and office equipment   3years   Laboratory equipment   5years   Purchased software   3 to 5years   Upon retirement or sale, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and the
resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations. Repairs and
maintenance are charged to operations as incurred.   Long-Lived Assets.The Company evaluates its
long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment by
comparison of the carrying amounts to future net undiscounted
cash flows expected to be generated by such assets when events
or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. Should an impairment exist, the
impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying
value of the asset over the assets fair value or
discounted estimates of future cash flows.   Revenue Recognition.The Company sells its
disposable catheters and radio frequency, or RF, generators, to
end-users in the United States and in international markets.
Catheters and RF generators are also sold through distributors
in certain international markets. The Company also sells RF
generators to third-party leasing companies in the United
States. These third-party leasing companies provide long-term
lease financing to end-users. The Company does not provide such
long-term lease financing to end-users.   The Company recognizes revenues from the sale of its products in
accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB
No104, Revenue Recognition, when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, title has transferred, the
sellers price is fixed or determinable and collectibility
is reasonably assured. For an arrangement with multiple
deliverables, the Company recognizes product sales in accordance
with EITF

SOPNo98-9,
Software Revenue Recognition with Respect to Certain
Agreements. The Company recognizes revenues when all of the
following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an

has occurred, collection of the related receivable is probable.
Where software is incidental to the product or arrangement, the
Company recognizes revenues from the sale of those products in

STATEMENTSContinued   The Companys domestic sales return policy allows customers
to return unused products for a period within 30days
subject to restocking fees. The Companys international
sales return policy allows customers to return unused products
for a period within 60days subject to restocking fees. The
Company makes provisions for estimated returns and allowances
based on historical levels. To date, returns and allowances have
not been significant.   Warranty.The Company provides a one year
limited warranty on its RF generator which is included in the
sales price of the generator. The Company provides for the
estimated future costs of repair, upgrade or replacement upon
shipment of the product. The warranty accrual is based upon
historical trends in the volume of product returns within the
warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment.
In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals are
made for specific technical problems.   Research and Development Costs.Costs related
to research, design and development of products are charged to
research and development expense as incurred.   Advertising Expenses.Advertising costs are
expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses incurred in the years
ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $664,000,
$262,000 and $321,000 respectively.   Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting
Principle.Upon the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFASNo. 123R
on January1, 2006, the Company elected to adopt the
modified prospective transition method of
SFASNo123R, Share-Based Payment, except for
those options that were measured using the minimum value method
under SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, for which the Company applied the prospective
transition method. The impact of the adoption has resulted in an
adjustment for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle.   Accordingly, during the year ended December31, 2006, the
Company recorded stock-based compensation cost totaling the
amount that would have been recognized had the fair value method
been applied since the effective date of SFASNo123.
Previously reported amounts have not been restated. The
cumulative effect, through December31, 2005, was a
decrease in stock-based compensation expense and a corresponding
increase to equity of $73,000 to reflect the application of the
estimated forfeiture rates to deferred stock-based compensation
related to the intrinsic value of restricted stock units granted
in 2005.   Comprehensive Income Loss.Comprehensive
income loss is defined as the change in equity of a company
during a period from transactions and other events and
circumstances, excluding transactions resulting from investments
by owners and distributions to owners, and is to include
unrealized gains and losses that have historically been excluded
from net income and loss and reflected instead in equity.
Unrealized gains and losses on short-term investments are
recorded in other comprehensive income loss as a component of
equity.   Income Taxes.The Company accounts for income
taxes under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset or
liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet
date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in
which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.   Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value
Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
No115, which is effective for fiscal years beginning
after November15, 2007.This statement permits
an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and
certain other items at fair value at specified election dates.
Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the
fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings.
The adoption of SFASNo. 159 is not anticipated to have a
material effect on our consolidated financial statements.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo157,
Fair Value Measurements. SFASNo157 defines
fair value, establishes a framework and gives guidance regarding
the methods used for measuring fair value, and   
58 Table of Contents   VNUS
MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.   NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
SFASNo157 is effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007,
and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of
SFASNo157 is not anticipated to have a material
effect on our consolidated financial statements.   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141 Revised
2007, Business Combinations. SFASNo. 141R will
change the accounting for business combinations. Under
SFASNo. 141R, an acquiring entity will be required to
recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a
transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited
exceptions. SFASNo. 141R will change the accounting
treatment and disclosure for certain specific items in a
business combination. SFASNo. 141R applies prospectively
to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
after the beginning of the first annual reporting period
beginning on or after December15, 2008. SFASNo. 141R
will have an impact on accounting for business combinations once
adopted but the effect is dependent upon acquisitions at that
time.   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No160,
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements An Amendment of ARB No51.
SFASNo. 160 establishes new accounting and reporting
standards for the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and
for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFASNo. 160 is
effective for fiscal years beginning on or after
December15, 2008. The adoption of SFASNo. 160 is not
anticipated to have a material effect on our consolidated
financial statements.   Note3
Concentration of Credit Risk   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a
concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable.
Cash and cash equivalents are deposited in demand and money
market accounts in several financial institutions in the United
States and internationally. Deposits held with financial
institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such
deposits. The Company has not experienced any material losses on
its deposits of cash and cash equivalents.   Concentrations of credit risk with respect to short-term
investments are limited due to the Companys cash
investment policies which limit cash investments to short-term,
low-risk investments. Short-term investments include money
market instruments, debt instruments of the U.S.government
and its agencies and high-quality corporate issuers, all with
maturity dates less than one year.   
59 Table of Contents   VNUS
MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.   NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts
receivable are limited due to the large number of customers
comprising the Companys customer base and their dispersion
across many geographies. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers and generally does not require
collateral from its customers. The Company maintains an
allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected
collectibility of all accounts receivable. No single customer
represents more than 10% of the accounts receivable amount or
revenues for any period presented.

selling these products in addition to monetary damages. On
October31, 2005, Diomed filed a new answer and
counterclaims against us for a judicial declaration that the
asserted patents are not infringed, are invalid and are
unenforceable. On December9, 2005, AngioDynamics and
Vascular Solutions both answered our amended complaint and
asserted counterclaims against us for a judicial declaration
that the asserted patents are not infringed and are invalid. We
have answered and denied all counterclaims against us. On
October30, 2006, a claims construction hearing was held,
and on November20, 2006, the Court issued its Order
Construing Claims. In October 2007, the Court denied numerous
motions for summary judgment, clearing the way for the case to
proceed to trial. The original trial commencement date of
October 2007 was postponed due to Court schedule delays and a
new trial date has been set for June 2008.   The Company is also involved in other legal proceedings arising
in the ordinary course of its business. While there can be no
assurances as to the ultimate outcome of any litigation
involving the Company, management does not believe any pending
legal proceeding will result in a judgment or settlement that
would have a material adverse effect on the Companys
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.   Leases.The Company leases office space and
equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with various
expiration dates through 2014. Rent expense for the years ended
December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $12million,
$14million, and $869,000, respectively. In November 2005,
the Company entered into a lease agreement with Legacy Partners
I SJ Fontanoso, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, for a
facility located in SanJose, California. As of
June30, 2006, the Company completed the move of its
headquarters and manufacturing operations to this facility,
which consists of 93,650square feet. The term of the lease
is March1, 2006 through February28, 2014, which
includes a rent holiday period during which the Company is not
required to make lease payments. The lease provides for rental
payments on a graduated scale. The Company recognizes rent
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period, and has
accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid.

contract, less the portion that would still be used by the
Company for storage for the remainder of the lease period. The
Company did not offset these lease payments by estimated
sublease rental income. Management concluded that subleasing the
Zanker facility was not probable.   Indemnifications.In the normal course of
business, the Company enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations and warranties and provide for
general indemnifications. The Companys exposure under
these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may
be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been
made. To date, the Company has not paid any claims or been
required to defend any action related to its indemnification
obligations, and accordingly, the Company has not accrued any
amounts for such indemnification obligations. However, the
Company may record charges in the future as a result of these
indemnification obligations.   Purchase Commitments.At December31,
2007, the Company had approximately $34million in
purchase commitments for the next twelve months with suppliers,
of which $28million was inventory related.

Share-Based
Compensation   Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted the
provisions of SFASNo123R, Share-Based Payment.
SFASNo123R establishes accounting for
stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. Accordingly,
share-based compensation expense is measured at grant date,
based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as
expense over the employees requisite service period. The
Company has no awards with market conditions. The Company
previously applied Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion
No25, Accounting for Shares Issued to Employees,
and related Interpretations and provided the required
pro-forma disclosures of SFASNo123, Accounting
for Share-Based Compensation.   The Company awards a limited number of stock options and
warrants to non-employees. Non-cash share-based expense from
options and warrants issued to non-employees is accounted for in
accordance with the provisions of EITF
No96-18,
Accounting for Equity Investments that are Issued to
Non-Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling,
Goods or Services. For these options and warrants, the
non-cash share-based expense is recognized over the service
period of the underlying awards, based on an estimate of their
fair value on the vesting dates using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. All unvested options issued to
non-employees are marked to market until such options vest. In
2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded non-employee share
compensation expense of $0, $10,000 and $62,000, respectively.   Prior
to the adoption of SFASNo123R   Prior to the adoption of SFASNo123R, the Company
provided the disclosures required under SFASNo123,

compensation was accounted for under SFASNo123R
during this period. Additionally, the share-based employee
compensation determined under SFASNo. 123 fair value
method for the year ended December31, 2005 have been
adjusted to exclude the effect of the options granted prior to
the Companys initial public offering in October 2004, as
those options were expensed using the minimum value method.   The weighted average per share fair value of options granted in
the year ended December31, 2005 was $639.   Impact
of the adoption of SFASNo123R   The Company elected to adopt the modified prospective
application method as provided by SFASNo123R,
except for those options that were measured using the minimum
value method under SFASNo123, for which the Company
has adopted the prospective transition method. Under the
modified prospective application, prior periods are not revised
for comparative purposes. The valuation provisions of
SFAS123R apply to new awards and to awards that are
outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified or
cancelled. Estimated compensation expense, net of estimated
forfeitures, for awards outstanding at the effective date will
be recognized over the remaining service period.   On November10, 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
No.FASNo123R-C, Transition Election
Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment
Awards. The Company has elected to adopt the alternative
transition method provided in this FASB Staff Position for
calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation pursuant
to SFASNo123R. The alternative transition method
includes a simplified method to establish the beginning balance
of the additional paid-in capital pool APIC pool related to
the tax effects of employee share-based compensation, which is
available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to
the adoption of SFASNo123R. There was no tax
benefit realized upon exercise of stock options for the years
ended December31, 2007 and 2006.   During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company
recorded a cumulative adjustment for share-based compensation
costs to expense the amount that would have been recognized had
the fair value method been applied since the effective date of
SFASNo123, to adjust for application of a
forfeiture rate to restricted stock unit awards granted during
2005. The previously reported amounts were not restated.   The following table sets forth the total share-based
compensation expense resulting from stock options and non-vested
stock awards included in the Companys Consolidated
Statements of Operations since the adoption of SFASNo.

MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.   NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Valuation
Assumptions   The Companys determination of fair value of share-based
payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing
model is affected by the Companys stock price as well as
assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective
variables.   The weighted average estimated fair value of options granted
during the twelve month periods ended December31, 2007,
December31, 2006 and December31, 2005, were
calculated under the Black-Scholes model, using the following
weighted-average assumptions   	
Years Ended   2007   2006   2005   Risk free interest rates   352% - 484   455% - 500   371% - 445   Expected life in years   485-525   525-625   37   Dividend yield          Volatility   797%-869   638%-962   5159   The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model, consistent with
the provisions of SFASNo123R, SABNo107
and the Companys prior period pro forma disclosures of net
earnings, including share-based compensation. The Black-Scholes
option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of short-lived exchange traded options that have no
vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including the options expected life and the
price volatility of the underlying stock. In connection with the
adoption of SFASNo123R, the Company reassessed its
valuation technique and related assumptions.   Expected volatility used in fiscal 2007 and 2006 was determined
using the historical volatility of the Companys common
stock and the historical volatility of a number of peer
companies to approximate expected volatility over the expected
term of the options. Prior to the adoption of
SFASNo123R, the Company used the historical
volatility of its common stock after its initial public offering
in October 2004 in deriving the expected volatility assumption.   The expected term of employee options granted was determined in
the first three quarters of 2006 based on
SABNo107s simplified method for estimating
expected term and represents the period of time that options
granted are expected to be outstanding. For the fourth quarter
of 2006 and throughout 2007, the Company determined the expected
term of employee options granted based upon a blended average of
the Companys historical experience and historical
experience of a number of peer companies. Prior to the adoption
of SFASNo123R, the Company was estimating the
expected term based on its historical exercise and post-vesting
cancellation experience. The risk-free interest rate for periods
within the contractual life of the option is based on the
monthly average risk-free zero-coupon interest rate that
corresponds to the expected term.   The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends and
does not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.   The Company has used forfeiture rates in its calculation of
share-based compensation expense for the twelve months ending
December31, 2007 and 2006, depending on the stratification
of the optionees, based on historical experience over the term.
Share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations for the twelve month period ending
December31, 2007 and 2006 is based on awards ultimately
expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
SFASNo123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at
the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent
periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. If
pre-vesting forfeitures occur in the future, the Company will
true up expense related to such forfeitures as the forfeitures

Incentive Program   In 1995, the Company established the 1995 Stock Option Plan the
1995 Plan covering employees, directors and
consultants of the Company. Under the terms of the 1995 Plan,
incentive and nonqualified stock options and stock purchase
rights could be granted for up to 1,008,000shares of the
Companys authorized but unissued common stock. In May
2000, upon the adoption of the Companys 2000 Equity
Incentive Plan the 2000 Plan, the Company ceased
granting options under the 1995 Plan.   In May 2000, the Company established the 2000 Plan covering
employees, directors and consultants of the Company. Under the
terms of the 2000 Plan, as amended, incentive and nonqualified
stock options and stock purchase rights may be granted.
Initially, 420,000shares of the Companys authorized
but unissued common stock were available for grant under the
2000 Plan. On each anniversary of the 2000 Plans adoption
by the Board of Directors, the share reserve was automatically
increased by 98,000shares. In 2001 and 2002, the
stockholders approved a 300,000 and a 133,333share
increase to the 2000 Plan, respectively. In January 2004, the
stockholders approved a 333,333share increase to the 2000
Plan. In October 2004, the stockholders approved ian
800,000share increase to the 2000 Plan, which increased
the number of authorized shares of the Companys common
stock issuable under the 2000 Plan to 2,378,666, and
iion December 31 of each year, beginning on
December31, 2005, further increase the number of shares
reserved for issuance under 2000 Plan by the lower of
x800,000shares, y4% of the number of
shares of the Companys common stock then outstanding or
zsuch other number of shares of our common stock as is
determined by the administrator of the 2000 Plan, provided that
the maximum number of shares of the Companys common stock
that may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock options
during the term of the 2000 Plan may not exceed 6,378,666.   Accordingly, on December31, 2007, 628,033shares were
authorized for issuance, equal to 4% of the shares outstanding
on that date. In September 2005, the Board of Directors adopted
a form of Restricted Stock Unit Award Grant Notice and
Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, intended to serve as a
standard form agreement for restricted stock unit grants
RSUs issued to employees, executive officers,
directors and consultants under the Companys VNUS Medical
Technologies, Inc. Amended and Restated 2000 Equity Incentive
Plan the Amended Equity Incentive Plan. The Board
approved the Amended Equity Incentive Plan in November 2005,
which authorized the granting of restricted stock units under
the plan including the form of grant adopted in September 2005
and permits employees to surrender a portion of their RSU shares
to pay for taxes.   Under the terms of the 1995 Plan and the Amended Equity
Incentive Plan, options and RSUs have a maximum term of
10years and vest over schedules determined by the Board of
Directors. Certain options, upon the discretion of the plan
administrator, are exercisable prior to becoming vested, and are
subject to the Companys right to repurchase the unvested
shares at the exercise price. Nonqualified stock options may be
granted to employees and consultants at no less than 85% of the
fair market value of the stock at the date of the grant.   In 2001, the Board of Directors approved a severance plan for
management and key employees whereby a change in control in the
Company would accelerate vesting of options under certain
conditions. On November7, 2005, the Board of Directors
adopted the Amended and Restated VNUS Severance Plan for
Management and Key Employees the Amended Severance
Plan. In particular, the Amended Severance Plan expands
the definition of good reason for determining
whether a participants termination of employment was a
qualifying termination, thereby entitling the
participant to certain payments and the acceleration of the
vesting of certain equity awards, including stock options,
restricted stock and restricted stock units. Good
reason now includes, with respect to participants that are
employees of the Company at the vice president level and above,
removal of duties customarily assigned to an employee with such
participants title, or a substantial adverse alteration in
the nature or status of such participants duties;
provided, however, that a significant reduction in job
responsibility
and/or
authority shall

MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.   NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   not be deemed to have occurred simply by virtue of a change of
control, the fact that the Company becomes a subsidiaries of
another entity or the Companys status changing from
publicly-traded to privately-held, as a result of the change of
control.   In 2007, the Board of Directors approved a modification to the
Amended Equity Incentive Plan with respect to non-employee
director compensation. The modification provided that each new
non-employee director shall be granted an initial option upon
appointment or election to the Board of Directors to purchase
18,000shares of Common Stock and an initial grant of 6,000
restricted stock units, which vest in three equal, yearly
installments so that the option and restricted stock units are
fully vested three years after the grant date. Each non-employee
director is also automatically granted an option to purchase
9,000shares of our Common Stock as well as 3,000
restricted stock units at each annual meeting of stockholders as
of which such director continues to serve that is at least six
months after the directors initial option and restricted
stock unit grant. These additional options and restricted stock
units vest in four 4, equal, consecutive, quarterly
installments so that such options and restricted stock units are
fully vested one year after the grant date.

Income
Taxes   At December31, 2007, the Company had net operating loss,
or NOL, carryforwards of approximately $381million and
$178million for federal and state jurisdictions,
respectively, available to reduce future taxable income. The
federal NOL carryforwards expire in various periods beginning
2018 through 2027 and the state NOL carry forwards expire in
various periods from 2012 through 2027. The Company had federal
and state research tax credit carryforwards of approximately
$08million and $10million, respectively. The
federal research credits expire in various periods through 2027
and the state research credits can be carried forward
indefinitely. The

assets through future taxable income, the Company has provided a
full valuation allowance, and, therefore, no benefit has been
recognized for the NOL and other deferred tax assets.
Approximately $143,000 of these deferred tax assets pertain to
certain net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the
exercise of employee stock options. When recognized, the tax
benefit of these loss carryforwards are accounted for as a
credit to additional paid-in capital rather than a reduction of
the income tax provision.   The Tax Reform Act of 1986 limits the use of NOL and tax credit
carryforwards in the case of an ownership change of
a corporation. Any ownership changes, as defined, may restrict
utilization of carryforwards.   The Company adopted the provisions of Financial Interpretation
No.FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement
No109, on January1, 2007. As a result of the
implementation of FIN48, the Company recognized a $73,000
benefit for a reduction in the liability for unrecognized income
tax benefits.

Controls
and Procedures   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as
such term is defined under Securities Exchange Act
Rules13a-15e
and
15d-15e,
that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures. We have carried out an evaluation under
the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of December31, 2007.   MANAGEMENTS
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule13a-15f
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The Companys internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and timely reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2007. In making this assessment, our
management used the criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. Based on our assessment management concluded that, as of
December31, 2007, our internal control over financial
reporting was effective based on these criteria.   The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated
in their report appearing in Item8 of this Annual Report
on
Form10-K.   CHANGES
IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   We previously reported a material weakness in our internal
control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule13a-15f
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which was described in
