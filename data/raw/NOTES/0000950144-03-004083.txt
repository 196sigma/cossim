Item8.Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data Report of Independent Auditors Board of Directors and Stockholders aaiPharma Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of aaiPharma Inc. as of December31, 2002
and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
cash flows, stockholders equity and comprehensive income
loss for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2002. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at d. These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of aaiPharma Inc.
at December31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December31, 2002, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein. As disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, as of January 1, 2002 the Company changed
its method of evaluating goodwill for impairment.

The accompanying notes are an integral part of
these financial statements. 45 aaiPharma Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2002 1.Significant Accounting Policies and
Other Matters   
Organization   
aaiPharma Inc. aaiPharma or the
Company is a science-based specialty pharmaceutical
company focused on the commercialization of branded
pharmaceutical products that the Company develops or acquires.
The Company also has a comprehensive range of pharmaceutical
development capabilities primarily in the United States and
Europe. In 2002, the majority of the Companys net revenues
came from the sale of commercial pharmaceutical products and to
developing new products or improving existing products. Prior to
2002, the majority of the Companys net revenues were
earned in the development services business. Major customers for
the Companys pharmaceutical products are large,
well-established medical wholesalers and distributors. Major
customers for the development services and product development
businesses are large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies.
Basis of Presentation and
Consolidation   
The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of aaiPharma Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
Certain balances in the prior years consolidated financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the
December31, 2002 presentation.
On January30, 2003, aaiPharmas board
of directors approved a 3-for-2 stock split of the
Companys common shares. On March10, 2003, each
stockholder received one additional share of common stock for
every two shares they owned on the record date of
February19, 2003. All share and per share amounts have
been restated to reflect the stock split for all periods
presented.
Revenue Recognition   
Revenues for product sales are recognized at the
time the products are shipped. Development services revenue from
fee-for-service contracts are recognized on a
percentage-of-completion basis as the work is performed, based
on the relationship between costs incurred and total estimated
costs, or on a time and materials basis in accordance with the
specific contract terms. Product development revenues consist of
licensing and royalty revenues. Licensing revenues are
recognized upon completion of interim contract milestones.
Royalty revenues are recognized as earned in accordance with
contract terms. Revenues from upfront licensing fees are
deferred and amortized over the term of the relevant agreement
or as on-going services are performed. Revenues from contract
milestones based on product approval are recognized when the
applicable product is approved. Work-in-progress represents
revenues recognized prior to contract billing terms. Provisions
for losses on contracts, if any, are recognized when identified.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange
Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No101
SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements. SAB 101 specifically addresses revenue
recognition issues related to certain upfront payments or fees.
Under SAB 101, certain upfront fees and payments recognized as
income in prior periods were required to be deferred and
amortized into revenue over the terms of the relevant agreements
or as the on going services were performed. Although the Company
implemented SAB 101 in the fourth quarter of 2000, the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle has been
retroactively adopted as of the beginning of the first quarter
of 2000. For the year 2000, the Company recorded a charge of
$1,456,000 $961,000 after tax for the cumulative effect of
this change in accounting principle. In 2002, 2001 and 2000, the
Company recognized $591,000, $500,000 and $733,000,
respectively, of revenue related to the amortization of these
deferred amounts. At December31, 2002, no balance remains
to be amortized into revenue in future periods.
46   
Income Taxes   
Income taxes have been accounted for using the
liability method in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No109 Accounting for Income
Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
reported amounts.
Research and Development Costs   
The Company engages in numerous research and
development RD projects with the objective of
growth and utilization of a portfolio of proprietary
technologies and patent and intellectual property rights to
bring products to market or to license or sell these
technologies to others. RD expenses represent direct
salaries of RD personnel, raw material expenses,
third-party consulting and testing costs, along with an
allocation of indirect costs such as management and
administrative overhead costs and facilities costs. RD
costs are charged to expense as incurred. Although there is a
risk that any specific RD project may not produce revenues,
the Company believes that the potential profit margins from
successful development projects will compensate for costs
incurred for unsuccessful projects. The Company is currently
involved in many pharmaceutical and technology development
projects and believes that these activities help to diversify
its RD portfolio and manage its risk.
Advertising   
The Company expenses advertising costs as
incurred, and these costs are included in selling expenses.
Advertising costs were $45 million, $09 million and $06
million for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively.
Earnings Loss per Share   
Basic earnings lossper share are based on
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the year. Diluted earnings lossper share are computed
assuming that the weighted average number of common shares was
increased by the conversion of stock options issued to employees
and members of the Companys Board of Directors. The
diluted per share amounts reflect a change in the number of
shares outstanding the denominator to include the
options as if they were converted to shares and issued, unless
their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. In 2002, 2001 and 2000,
2,296,001, 824,378 and 2,700,407 options were excluded as they
were anti-dilutive. In each year presented, the net income
loss the numerator is the same for both basic
and diluted per share computations.
The following table provides a reconciliation of
the denominators for the basic and diluted earnings
lossper share computations:

Concentration of Credit Risk   
The Company is subject to a concentration of
credit risk with respect to its accounts receivable balance, all
of which is due from wholesalers, distributors and large and
small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Approximately
35% of the accounts receivable balance at December31, 2002
represented amounts due from two customers. At December31,
2001, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the
Companys accounts receivable balance. The Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains
reserves for potential uncollectible accounts. Actual losses
from uncollectible accounts have been minimal.
47   
In 2002, three customers accounted for
approximately 19%, 18% and 12%, respectively, of the
Companys revenues. One customer accounted for
approximately 15% of the Companys revenue in both 2001 and
2000.
Cash and Cash Equivalents   
The Company considers all highly liquid
investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to
be cash equivalents.
Work-in-Progress   
Work-in-progress represents revenues recognized
prior to contract billing terms.
Inventories   
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
determined on a first-in, first-out basis or market.
Property and Equipment   
Property and equipment is recorded at cost.
Depreciation is recognized using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciable lives are
315years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 15 years
for equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
lesser of the asset life or the lease term.
Goodwill and Other Intangibles, Net   
For the years ended December31, 2001 and
2000, goodwill, defined as the excess of the purchase price over
the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses, was
amortized over 20years. In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No141, Business
Combinations SFAS No. 141, the Company
ceased amortization of goodwill as of January1, 2002. For
purchase business combinations consummated subsequent to
June30, 2001, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment on an
annual basis or as impairment indicators are identified.
Goodwill amortization for the year ended December31, 2001
was $06 million. At December31, 2002 and 2001, the
amounts for accumulated amortization of goodwill were
approximately $40 million and $34 million, respectively. The
change in accumulated goodwill amortization from
December31, 2001 to December31, 2002 is due to
foreign currency exchange rate changes. Other identifiable
intangible assets are amortized, if applicable see note 2, on
a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which
range from 3 to 20years. At December31, 2002 and
2001, the amounts of accumulated amortization of identifiable
intangibles were approximately $30million and
$03million, respectively.
The changes in the carrying value of goodwill by
operating segment for the year ended December31, 2002 were:

The total intangible asset amortization expense
for the year ended December31, 2002, was
$27million, and is included in general and administrative
expenses. Amortization expense for the next five years is
estimated to be approximately $33million per year.
On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses the
value of its goodwill, intangibles and other assets by
determining their ability to recover the unamortized balances
over the remaining useful lives. Goodwill, intangibles and other
long-lived assets determined to be unrecoverable would be
written-off in the period in which such determination is made.
Foreign Currency Translation   
The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries
have been translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No52
Foreign Currency Translation. All balance sheet
accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect
at the balance sheet dates. Income statement amounts have been
translated using the average exchange rates for the respective
years. The gains and losses resulting from the changes in
exchange rates from year to year have been reported in
accumulated other comprehensive income lossincluded in
the consolidated statements of stockholders equity.
Derivative Financial Instruments   
aaiPharma uses an interest rate swap agreement to
modify its fixed rate obligation to a variable rate obligation,
thereby adjusting the interest rate to the current market rate
and ensuring that the debt instrument is always reflected at
fair value. The Company follows Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended
SFAS No133, to account for its interest
rate swap using hedge accounting treatment. The Company has
outstanding one interest rate swap agreement to convert a
portion of fixed rate debt to a floating rate basis, thus
hedging for changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt
being hedged. The Company has determined that this interest rate
swap agreement, designated as a fair value hedge, qualifies for
treatment under the short-cut method of measuring effectiveness.
Under the provisions of SFAS No133, this hedge is
determined to be perfectly effective, and there is
no requirement to periodically evaluate effectiveness. See Note
6 for additional details on the outstanding interest rate swap
agreement.
Impact of Recently Issued Accounting
Standards   
In April2002, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, Rescission of FASB
Statements No4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement
No13, and Technical Corrections SFAS
No145. This statement eliminates the automatic
classification of gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt
as an extraordinary item and requires that any such gain or loss
be reviewed under the criteria of Accounting Principles Board
No30 Reporting Results of Operations. This
statement also requires sale-leaseback accounting for certain
lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar
to sale-leaseback transactions, and makes various other
technical corrections to existing pronouncements. The statement
is effective for fiscal years beginning after May15, 2002.
We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS No145 will
have a significant impact on our results of operations,
consolidated financial position or cash flows.
In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No146, Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
SFAS No146. SFAS No146 is effective
for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after
December31, 2002. The Company does not expect that the
adoption of SFAS No146 will have a significant impact on
the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial
position or cash flows.
49   
In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No148, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and
Disclosure SFAS No148. SFAS
No148 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS No123, to provide alternative
methods of transition to SFAS No123s fair value
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS
No148 also amends the disclosure provisions in SFAS
No123 and APB Opinion No28, Interim
Financial Reporting, to require disclosure in the summary
of significant accounting policies of the effects of an
entitys accounting policy with respect to stock-based
employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per
share in annual and interim financial statements. The adoption
of SFAS No148 did not have a significant impact on the
Companys consolidated results of operations, financial
position or cash flows.
Employee Stock-Based Compensation   
The Company follows Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB No25 and related
Interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options as
permitted by SFAS No123 Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation and make the required pro forma disclosures
required by SFAS No123 and SFAS No148. Under APB
No25, if the exercise price of the Companys stock
options is not less than the estimated fair market value of the
underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense
is recognized.
The fair value for stock options was estimated at
the date of grant using a Black-Scholes pricing model with the
following weighted average assumptions:

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the
estimated fair value of the stock options is amortized to
expense over the vesting period. The grant date Black-Scholes
weighted average fair value of options issued at market price
was $1149, $890 and $329 per share for 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively, and the weighted average fair value of options
issued in excess of market price was $994 per share in 2002. No
options were issued in excess of market price in 2001 or 2000.
The Company applies APB Opinion No25 and
related Interpretations in accounting for its stock option
plans; therefore, compensation expense has not been recognized
for options granted at fair value. If compensation cost for the
Companys plans had been determined based on the fair value
at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with
the fair value method of SFAS No. 123,
50   
the Companys net income lossand

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, work-in-progress and current liabilities
approximate fair values as of December 31, 2002 and 2001. Based
on borrowing rates currently available to the Company, the
carrying value of the variable rate debt approximated fair
value. The fair market value of the Companys fixed rate
debt is estimated based on market quotations. At
December31, 2002, the fair market value was approximately
the carrying value.
Use of Estimates   
The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
The most significant estimates relate to the allowance for
doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, sales allowances and
useful lives for intangible assets. Actual results could differ
from such estimates and changes in such estimates may affect
amounts reported in future periods.
Extraordinary Loss   
In March 2002, the Company recorded a charge of
$53 million, net of a tax benefit of $27 million, to record
the write-off of deferred financing and other costs related to
its prior debt facilities.
2.Business Combinations   
On March28, 2002, the Company acquired the
U.S. rights to the Darvon and Darvocet-N branded product lines,
which treat mild-to-moderate pain, and existing inventory from
Eli Lilly and Company, in a business combination accounted for
as a purchase. The Company acquired these product lines and
related intangible assets for $2114 million. To finance this
acquisition, which included $18 million of inventory, the
Company used the proceeds from the senior secured credit
facilities and senior subordinated notes, as described in note
6. The Darvon and Darvocet-N product lines did not have
separable assets and liabilities associated with them, other
than inventory, therefore the Company allocated the purchase
price, including acquisition related expenses, to acquired
identifiable assets, with the excess of the purchase price over
the identifiable tangible and intangible assets recorded as
goodwill. Based on this allocation, $512 million of intangible
assets have been identified and will be amortized over
20years. In accordance with SFAS No141 and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142
Accounting for Goodwill and Intangibles, the excess
of the purchase price over identifiable intangible assets has
been classified as goodwill, which is not subject to
amortization.

In December 2001, the Company acquired from
Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation and Novartis Corporation a
line of asthma products used in the prevention and reversal of
bronchospasm in patients age 12 and older with asthma and
reversible bronchospasm associated with bronchitis and
emphysema, in a business combination accounted for as a
purchase. The product line acquired is marketed under the
Brethine brand name. The Company acquired this product line and
related intangible assets for $266 million. To finance this
acquisition, the Company used the proceeds from an additional
$25 million term loan, which was refinanced by the new senior
secured credit facility as described in note 6, and used working
capital to pay the remainder of the purchase price. Revenues
from the sales of these products are included in the
Companys results of operations beginning on the
acquisition date. The Brethine product line did not have
separable assets and liabilities associated with it, therefore
the Company allocated the purchase price, including acquisition
related expenses, to acquired identifiable intangible assets in
the amount of $99 million, which are being amortized over
20years, with the excess of the purchase price over the
identifiable intangible assets recorded as goodwill in the
amount of $167 million.
In August 2001, the Company completed the
acquisition of a line of critical care injectable and oral
nutrition products from AstraZeneca AB, an affiliate of
AstraZeneca PLC, in a business combination accounted for as a
purchase. The product lines acquired are marketed under the
M.V.I. and Aquasol brand names. The Company acquired these
product lines and related intangible assets for payments of up
to $100 million over three years. To finance the initial payment
for this acquisition of $525 million, which included $37
million of inventory, the Company used the proceeds from a term
loan, which was refinanced under the senior secured credit
facility as described in note 6. An additional guaranteed
payment of $10 million was made in August 2002 and a future
guaranteed payment of $10 million is due in August 2003. The
acquisition agreement provided for future contingent payments. A
contingent payment of $20 million would have been due in August
2003 if the FDA had approved by December31, 2002 the
reformulated M.V.I.-12 product with a minimum shelf life of
12months. In addition, a contingent payment of up to $435
million is due in August 2004 if FDA approval of the
reformulated M.V.I.-12 product is received on or before
December31, 2003, with the $435 million payment being
reduced by $10 million for each month after December31,
2002 during which FDA approval has not been obtained. The $435
million payment will become zero in the event FDA approval is
not obtained on or before December31, 2003. An application
for approval of this reformulated product was submitted to the
FDA in February 2003. These contingent obligations have not been
recorded as a liability on the Companys balance sheet.
Revenues from the sales of these products are included in the
Companys results of operations beginning on the
acquisition date. The M.V.I. and Aquasol product lines did not
have separable assets and liabilities associated with them,
other than inventory, therefore the Company allocated the
purchase price, including acquisition related expenses, to
acquired identifiable tangible and intangible assets in the
amount of $320 million, with
52   
the excess of the purchase price over the
identifiable intangible assets recorded as goodwill in the
amount of $192 million.
In connection with the M.V.I. and Aquasol
acquisition, the Company recorded $320 million in intangible
assets which meet the criteria for having an indefinite life. In
accordance with SFAS No142, these intangible assets are
not being amortized. The intangible assets recorded in
connection with this acquisition represents the trademarks,
technology and know-how associated with the product lines. In
addition, the value recorded as goodwill is not being amortized
and is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis in accordance
with SFAS No142.
During July 2001, the Company made an initial
payment of $09 million to acquire the assets of a sterile
manufacturing facility located in Charleston, South Carolina. In
2002, a $02 million payment was made based on the level of
manufacturing revenues at this facility. Additional contingent
payments of up to $48 million plus additional royalties may
become due in increments through June30, 2006 based on the
level of manufacturing revenues during this period. These
contingent payment obligations have not yet been recorded as a
liability on our consolidated balance sheets.

In March 2002, the Company entered into a $175
million senior secured credit facility consisting of a $750
million five-year revolving credit facility and a $100 million
five-year term loan facility. The term loan facility amortizes
over the full five-year term. The senior facilities were
subsequently reduced to $125 million due to the $50 million of
repayments made under the term loan facility. The availability
of borrowings under the revolving credit facility is not limited
by a borrowing base. At December31, 2002, the Company had
unused availability under the revolving credit facility of
$275million. The senior credit facilities provide for
variable interest rates based on LIBOR or an alternate base
rate, at the Companys option. On December31, 2002,
30-day LIBOR was 138%. Such facilities are guaranteed by all
domestic subsidiaries and secured by a security interest on
substantially all domestic assets, all of the stock of domestic
subsidiaries and 65% of the stock of material foreign
subsidiaries. The senior credit facilities require the payment
of certain commitment fees based on the unused portion of the
revolving credit facility. These senior credit facilities may be
prepaid at any time without a premium.
54   
Also in March 2002, the Company issued $175
million of senior subordinated notes due April1, 2010. The
proceeds from the issuance of these notes were $1739 million,
which was net of the original issue discount. This discount will
be charged to interest expense over the term of the notes. These
notes have a fixed interest rate of 11% per annum and are
guaranteed on a subordinated basis by all existing domestic
subsidiaries and all future domestic subsidiaries that are owned
80% or more by the Company. The notes are not secured. Prior to
the third anniversary of the date of issuance of the notes, up
to 35% of the notes are redeemable with the proceeds of
qualified sales of equity at 111% of par value. The terms of the
senior credit facilities require repayment of all of the
indebtedness under these facilities before repurchase of any of
the notes. On or after the fourth anniversary of the date of
issuance of the notes, all or any portion of the notes are
redeemable at declining premiums to par value, beginning at
1055%.
Concurrent with the issuance of the senior
subordinated notes, the Company entered into an interest rate
swap agreement to effectively convert interest expense on $140
million of senior subordinated notes for the term of the notes
from an 11% fixed annual rate to a floating annual rate equal to
6-month LIBOR plus a base rate. On May30, 2002,
August5, 2002 and September19, 2002, the Company
sold the then outstanding swap agreements for $44 million, $56
million and $37 million, respectively. The amounts received,
less the interest benefit earned through the dates of sale, have
been recorded as a premium to the carrying amount of the notes
and are being amortized into interest income over their
remaining life. At December31, 2002, the Company had an
interest rate swap agreement in place covering $150 million of
the notes, at a rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 654%. Under this
agreement, 6-month LIBOR was locked at 185%, giving us an
all-in rate of 839%. On February27, 2003, this interest
rate swap was sold for $23 million, and a new swap was entered
into covering $150 million of the notes, at a rate of 6-month
LIBOR plus 694%, giving us an estimated all-in rate of 828%.
The terms of the interest rate swap agreements, other than the
notional amount and the base rate, were identical and were
perfectly matched with the terms of the related hedged
instrument. On December31, 2002 and February28,
2003, 6-month LIBOR was 138% and 134%, respectively.
Under the terms of the senior secured credit
facility and the senior subordinated notes, the Company is
required to comply with various covenants including, but not
limited to, those pertaining to maintenance of certain financial
ratios and incurring additional indebtedness. The Company was in
compliance with the covenants at December31, 2002.

7.Stockholders Equity   
The authorized capital stock of the Company at
December31, 2002 and 2001 was 100 million shares of voting
common stock, $0001 par value per share, and 5 million shares
of preferred stock, $0001 par value per share. The preferred
stock is issuable in one or more series by the Companys
Board of Directors without further stockholder approval. No
preferred stock was outstanding at December31, 2002 or
2001. The Company has reserved 6,612,753 shares of common stock
for issuance under the stock option plans at December31,
2002.
Stock Option and Award
Plans
The Company has five stock option plans: the 2000
Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors the 2000
Plan, the 1997 Stock Option Plan the 1997
Plan, the 1996 Stock Option Plan the
55   
1996 Plan, the 1995 Stock Option
Plan the 1995 Plan and the 1996 Incentive and
Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan the MTRA Plan.
Under the 1995 Plan, the Board of Directors initially could
grant options to purchase up to 363,807 shares of common stock.
However, the Company has no obligation to issue the shares upon
exercise of such options until it has purchased an equal number
of shares from certain existing stockholders. Under the 2000
Plan, the 1997 Plan and the 1996 Plan, the Board of Directors
initially could grant options to purchase up to 615,000,
3,966,000 and 743,441, respectively, of newly issued shares of
common stock. The Board of Directors reserved 776,250 shares to
cover the exercise of the options under the MTRA Plan. The plans
require that the exercise price of options cannot be less than
either 100% 2000 Plan, 1997 Plan and MTRA Plan or 75% 1996
and 1995 Plans of the estimated fair market value of the
Companys shares of common stock on the date of grant.

8.Related Party Transactions   
Endeavor
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
In 1994, aaiPharma organized Endeavor
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. with Berlex Laboratories, Inc. and several
other investors to fund the development of hormone
pharmaceutical products, initially focusing on several generic
hormone products already under development by the Company. The
Company has
56   
also agreed to permit Endeavor, under certain
circumstances, the first right to purchase additional
proprietary hormone pharmaceutical products developed by
aaiPharma. aaiPharma obtained a 47% equity interest in Endeavor
through the contribution of its accumulated product research and
development and technical know-how. The other investors
contributed cash in exchange for their interests which, for all
investors, was in the form of convertible preferred stock. Based
on subsequent investments by other investors, at
December31, 2002 the Companys interest, assuming
conversion, had been reduced to approximately 13% of the fully
diluted common equity of Endeavor. Subsequent to the reduction
in ownership percentage and its reduced influence over the
Endeavor operations, the Company ceased accounting for this as
an equity method investment and began to account for it under
the cost method. Endeavor has accumulated significant losses
since inception and this investment has been recorded at zero
value since 1995.
The Company had net sales to Endeavor of
approximately $11 million, $02 million, and $07 million for
the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. aaiPharma had approximately $292,000 and $79,000
in related accounts receivable at December31, 2002 and
2001, respectively.
Aesgen, Inc.
Aesgen, Inc. Aesgen was formally
organized with an affiliate of the Mayo Clinic and MOVA
Pharmaceutical Corporation and funded in 1995 through the
issuance of approximately $11 million of nonconvertible,
nonvoting, mandatorily redeemable, preferred stock. The Company
made a cash investment of $16 million in such preferred stock,
which is carried at cost, and is included in other noncurrent
assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
In October 2001, the Company entered into a
Service Agreement and a Subscription Agreement with Aesgen,
whereby the Company has agreed to perform certain clinical work
for Aesgen and to receive Aesgen preferred stock in lieu of cash
for the services performed. The Company has subscribed to $11
million of preferred stock, and will receive up to 10,829 shares
of such stock, in lieu of cash for the related shares. Through
December31, 2002, the Company has performed services under
the agreement of $580,000. At December31, 2002, the
Company held approximately 100% of Aesgens fully diluted
common stock. If all $11 million of services are performed, the
Company expects to own 142% of Aesgen on a fully diluted basis.
The preferred shares are to be issued in accordance with a
timetable established by the Subscription Agreement.
In December 2001, the Company entered into a
Product Sales Agreement with Aesgen. Under this agreement,
Aesgen sold its rights, title and interest to certain products
to the Company. These products include five products for which
abbreviated new drug applications have been filed with the
United States Food and Drug Administration, and two products
under development. As consideration for the purchase of these
products, the Company waived all claims to amounts due from
Aesgen and terminated the development and licensing agreement,
as described below. At December31, 2002, the approximate
book value of these assets was $600,000.
In February 2002, the Company purchased a
proprietary product from Aesgen for payments of
$10million in cash and additional contingent milestone
payments of up to $15 million. Recently, the prerequisite for
payment of an additional $500,000 of such contingent milestones
occurred and such payment was made to Aesgen, while the
prerequisites for payment of the remaining $10 million were not
met and no further payment of this amount is owed by the
Company. The Company intends to market this product as an
extension of the Aquasol product line. Under this agreement, the
Company is obligated to pay royalty payments equal to 30% of the
net revenues of the product acquired from Aesgen, less certain
costs incurred in its manufacture and marketing, for the
eight-year period following the first commercial sale of the
product.
In 1996, the Company sold to Aesgen marketing
rights to a product under development by the Company. Under the
agreement, Aesgen paid a license fee and would have paid
additional royalties upon marketing the product. aaiPharma had
the right, under its development agreement with Aesgen, to
provide certain product development and support services to
Aesgen with respect to some generic drugs currently being
developed by Aesgen, provided that aaiPharmas fees for
such services were comparable to those of a competitor. In
addition, under such development agreement, the Company had
agreed not to develop, for its own account or any other person,
a formulation of any of the
57   
generic products currently under development for
Aesgen and any additional drugs that aaiPharma agrees to develop
in the future for Aesgen.
aaiPharma recognized net revenues of
approximately $494,000, $86,000 and $100,000 from Aesgen for the
years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The Company had no related accounts receivable or
work-in-progress at December31, 2002 or 2001.
Cetan
Technologies, Inc.   
In 1999, the Company advanced $300,000 to Cetan
Technologies, Inc. Cetan, formerly known as
PharmComm, Inc., a company whose principal stockholders include
Dr.Frederick Sancilio and Mr.James Waters, both
directors of aaiPharma.
The advance payment was for services to be
rendered by Cetan during 1999 and 2000 for scanning and indexing
services required as part of aaiPharmas regulatory
compliance and record retention policies. aaiPharma has engaged
Cetan to perform these services since 1996 and has compensated
Cetan pursuant to written agreements for the services. Cetan
also has provided computer validation services to aaiPharma,
which are required for compliance with regulatory requirements.
Total payments for scanning and validation
services provided to aaiPharma by Cetan were approximately
$7,000, $4,000, and $308,000 excluding the advance payment for
the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. At December31, 2000, the advance payment had
been fully utilized.

domestic aaiPharma employees with one year of service through a
defined contribution plan qualified under section 401k of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Participants may
elect to contribute a portion of their annual compensation,
subject to limitations. The Company makes matching contributions
in aaiPharma stock equal to 50% of a participants
contribution up to a certain amount. Additionally, the Company
makes profit-sharing contributions at the discretion of the
Board of Directors. The Company has expensed
59   
$986,000, $788,000, and $880,000 for the years
ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, for
this benefit plan.
11.Commitments and
Contingencies   
The Company leases land, buildings and equipment
under renewable lease agreements classified as operating leases.
Rent expense under these agreements for the years ended
December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $70 million, $69
million, and $49 million, respectively. As of December31,
2002, future minimum rentals due under non-cancelable operating

The Company is party to lawsuits and
administrative proceedings incidental to the normal course of
business. While the outcomes of these suits cannot be completely
predicted, the Company does not believe that any liabilities
related to such lawsuits or proceedings will have a material
adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results
of operations or cash flows and intends to vigorously pursue all
defenses available. In cases where aaiPharma has initiated an
action, the Company intends to prosecute these claims to the
full extent of its rights under the law.
The Company is party to a number of legal actions
with companies that market generic drugs. The Company filed
three cases in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of North Carolina claiming infringement of certain of
its fluoxetine hydrochloride patents. Fluoxetine hydrochloride
is an active ingredient in the drug marketed by Eli Lilly as
Prozac. The defendants in these three actions,
Dr.Reddys Laboratories Ltd., a pharmaceutical
company based in India, and its U.S. affiliate,
Dr.Reddys Laboratories, Inc. formerly
Reddy-Cheminor, Inc. sell a generic fluoxetine hydrochloride
product in the United States.
The Company is also involved in four actions
centered on its omeprazole-related patents. Omeprazole is the
active ingredient found in Prilosec, a drug sold by AstraZeneca
AB. Two of these cases have been filed against the Company by
Dr. Reddys Laboratories Ltd. and Dr.Reddys
Laboratories, Inc. in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York. In these cases, the plaintiffs
are seeking a declaratory judgment that their omeprazole
products do not infringe the Companys patents and in
addition, they are challenging the validity of five of the
Companys omeprazole patents. They also seek to recover
costs and attorneys fees. Furthermore, in a second case,
filed in November 2001, the plaintiffs are seeking damages for
alleged misappropriation of trade secrets, tortious
interference, unfair competition and violations of the North
Carolina Unfair Trade Practice Act.
A third case involving the Companys
omeprazole patents was brought in August 2001 by Andrx
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Andrx in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. Andrx is
challenging the validity of three of the Companys
omeprazole patents, and is also seeking a declaratory judgment
that its generic omeprazole product does not infringe these
patents. Furthermore, Andrx claims violations of federal and
state antitrust laws with respect to the licensing of these
omeprazole patents and is seeking injunctive relief and
unspecified treble damages.
The fourth case involving the omeprazole patents
was brought in December 2002 by the Company against Kremers
Urban Development Co., Schwarz Pharma Inc. and Schwarz Pharma AG
collectively, KUDCO in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York. The case involves
claims of infringement of the omeprazole patent dealing with a
dry-blend process of manufacturing omeprazole products. KUDCO
has filed its answer to the complaint, denying the claims,
asserting various affirmative defenses, and asserting
counterclaims of patent invalidity, product non-infringement and
antitrust violations under federal and state antitrust laws.
aaiPharma intends to vigorously defend its patent rights and
defend against the foregoing defenses and counterclaims asserted
by KUDCO.
The Company may be party to other lawsuits and
administrative proceedings incidental to the normal course of
its business which are not considered material.
60 12.Financial Information by Business
Segment and Geographic Area   
The Company operates in three business segments
consisting of a product sales business, primarily comprised of
the pharmaceuticals business unit, a product development
business, primarily the research and development business unit,
and a development services business, primarily the AAI
International business unit. The product sales business provides
for the sales of M.V.I., Aquasol, Brethine, Darvon, Darvocet-N
and Azasan product lines and for the commercial manufacturing of
small quantity products outsourced by other pharmaceutical
companies. In the product development segment, the Company
internally develops drugs and technologies for future sales by
the product sales business or with the objective of licensing
marketing rights to third parties in exchange for license fees
and royalties. The core services provided by the development
services business on a fee-for-service basis to pharmaceutical
and biotechnology industries worldwide include comprehensive
formulation, testing and manufacturing expertise, in addition to
the ability to take investigational products into and through
human clinical trials. The majority of the Companys
non-U.S. operations are located in Germany.
Corporate income lossfrom operations
includes general corporate overhead costs and, in fiscal 2001
and 2000, goodwill amortization, which are not directly
attributable to a business segment. Financial data by segment
