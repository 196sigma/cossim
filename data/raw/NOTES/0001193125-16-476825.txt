Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15f or 15d-15f promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys principal executive and principal financial
officers and effected by the Companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Management has designed its internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officers and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework 2013, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31,
2015. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm, who audited the consolidated financial statements
included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and their report is set forth on page 45.

The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, financial statement schedule, and on the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Houston,

2. Significant Accounting Policies 
Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of the Companys more significant estimates are those affected by critical accounting policies for revenue recognition, inventories and contingent liabilities. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Short-term investments that have a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company
invests excess cash in interest bearing accounts, money market mutual funds and funds which invest in U.S. Treasury obligations and repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury obligations. The Companys investment objectives continue to be
the preservation of capital and the maintenance of liquidity. 
52 Table of Contents
Trade Receivables 
The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts on trade receivables equal to amounts estimated to be uncollectible. This estimate is
based upon historical collection experience combined with a specific review of each customers outstanding trade receivable balance. Management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate; however, actual write-offs may exceed
the recorded allowance. Inventories 
Inventory costs are determined principally by the use of the first-in, first-out FIFO costing method and are stated at the lower of cost or
market. Company manufactured inventory is valued principally using standard costs, which are calculated based upon direct costs incurred and overhead allocations and approximate actual costs. Inventory purchased from third-party vendors is
principally valued at the weighted average cost. Periodically, obsolescence reviews are performed on slow-moving inventories and reserves are established based on current assessments about future demands and market conditions. The inventory values
have been reduced by a reserve for excess and slow-moving inventories. Inventory reserves of $392 million and $346 million were recorded as of December31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. If market conditions are less favorable than those
projected by management, additional inventory reserves may be required. Property, Plant and Equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost, with depreciation provided on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, an impairment charge is recognized by reflecting the asset at
its fair value. No impairments of long-lived assets were recorded in 2015, 2014 or 2013. Income Taxes 
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Current income taxes are provided on income reported for financial
statement purposes, adjusted for transactions that do not enter into the computation of income taxes payable in the same year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates for the expected future tax consequences of
temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
Revenue Recognition 
Product revenues The
Company recognizes product revenues from two methods:  product revenues recognized under the percentage-of-completion method; and  product revenues from the sale of products that do not qualify for the percentage-of-completion method. 
53 Table of Contents
Revenues recognized under the percentage-of-completion method 
The Company uses the percentage-of-completion method on long-term project contracts that have the following characteristics: the contracts call for products which are designed to customer specifications;  the structural designs are unique and require significant engineering and manufacturing efforts generally requiring more than one year in duration; the contracts contain specific terms as to milestones, progress billings and delivery dates; and  product requirements cannot be filled directly from the Companys standard inventory. 
For each project, the Company prepares a detailed analysis of estimated costs, profit margin, completion date and risk factors which include
availability of material, production efficiencies and other factors that may impact the project. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the progress of each project, which may result in revisions of previous estimates, including revenue
recognition. The Company calculates the percent complete and applies the percentage to determine the revenues earned and the appropriate portion of total estimated costs. Losses, if any, are recorded in full in the period they become known.
Historically, the Companys estimates of total costs and costs to complete have approximated actual costs incurred to complete the project. 
Under the percentage-of-completion method, billings do not always correlate directly to the revenue recognized. Based upon the terms of the
specific contract, billings may be in excess of the revenue recognized, in which case the amounts are included in customer prepayments as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Likewise, revenue recognized may exceed customer billings in
which case the amounts are reported in trade receivables. Unbilled revenues are expected to be billed and collected within one year. At December31, 2015 and 2014, receivables included $708 million and $680 million of unbilled receivables,
respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015, there were 14 projects representing approximately 16% of the Companys total revenues and approximately 19% of its product revenues, and 17 projects during 2014 representing approximately 11%
of the Companys total revenues and approximately 13% of its product revenues, which were accounted for using percentage-of-completion accounting. 
Revenues not recognized under the percentage-of-completion method 
Revenues from the sale of inventory products, not accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method, are recorded at the time the
manufacturing processes are complete and ownership is transferred to the customer. Service revenues 
The Company earns service revenues from three sources:  technical advisory assistance;  rental of running tools; and  rework and reconditioning of customer-owned Dril-Quip products. The Company does not install
products for its customers, but it does provide technical advisory assistance. At the time of delivery of the product, the customer is not obligated to buy or rent the Companys running tools and the Company is not obligated to perform any
subsequent services relating to installation. Technical advisory assistance service revenue is recorded at the time the service is rendered. Service revenues associated with the rental of running and installation tools are recorded as earned. Rework
and reconditioning service revenues are recorded when the refurbishment process is complete. 
54 Table of Contents
The Company normally negotiates contracts for products, including those accounted for under the
percentage-of-completion method, and services separately. For all product sales, it is the customers decision as to the timing of the product installation as well as whether Dril-Quip running tools will be purchased or rented. Furthermore, the
customer is under no obligation to utilize the Companys technical advisory assistance services. The customer may use a third party or their own personnel. 
Foreign Currency The
financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates except for revenues and expenses, which are translated at average monthly rates. Translation adjustments are reflected as a separate component
of stockholders equity and have no effect on current earnings or cash flows. Foreign currency exchange transactions are recorded
using the exchange rate at the date of the settlement. The Company experienced exchange gains of approximately $39 million and $34 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and exchange losses of $46 million in 2013, net of income taxes. These
amounts are included in selling, general and administrative costs in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a pre-tax basis. Fair
Value of Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, receivables
and payables. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their respective fair values as they are short-term in nature. 
Concentration of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments which subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily include trade receivables. The Company grants credit
to its customers, which operate primarily in the oil and gas industry. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains reserves for
potential losses, and actual losses have historically been within managements expectations. In addition, the Company invests excess
cash in interest bearing accounts, money market mutual funds and funds which invest in obligations of the U.S. Treasury and repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury obligations. Changes in the financial markets and interest rates could affect
the interest earned on short-term investments. Earnings Per Share 
Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
year. Diluted earnings per common share are computed considering the dilutive effect of stock options and awards using the treasury stock method. 
3. New Accounting Standards 
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 Income Taxes Topic 740. In an effort to reduce complexity the
requirement to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts will no longer be necessary. In the future, all deferred income taxes will be considered noncurrent and will continue to be offset into a single
amount within each country. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Companys financial statements will be revised to reflect this amendment beginning
in the first quarter of 2017. 
55 Table of Contents
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11 Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory Topic
330. This standard states that inventory within the scope of this update should be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the normal course of business, less
reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the impact of
the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers Topic 606. The amendment applies a new five-step revenue recognition model to be used in recognizing revenues associated with customer contracts. The amendment requires disclosure sufficient to enable readers of financial
statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures, significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets
recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill the contract. The standards effective date was originally for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. On April1, 2015,
the FASB voted to defer the effective date by one year to December15, 2017 and interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2017. The Company is evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated
financial statements.

The Company is required to recognize the impact of a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon
examination based upon the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any appeals. Based on the Companys evaluation, the Company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the
Companys financial statements. The evaluation was performed for the tax years which remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions as of December31, 2015, which are the years ended December31, 2008 through
December31, 2014. The Company has occasionally been assessed interest or penalties by major tax jurisdictions; these assessments historically have not materially impacted the Companys financial results. Interest expense assessed by tax
jurisdictions is included with interest expense and assessed penalties are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The
Company evaluates uncertain tax positions for recognition and measurement in the consolidated financial statements. To recognize a tax position, the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained upon
examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more likely than not threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in
the consolidated financial statements. The amount of tax benefit recognized with respect to any tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company had no
uncertain tax positions that required recognition in the consolidated financial statements at December31, 2015 and 2014. If it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized, a valuation allowance would be
established to reduce deferred tax assets. As of December31, 2015 and 2014, the Company determined that a valuation allowance was not necessary.

As part of the United Kingdoms U.K. growth agenda, the patent box tax regime, effective
April1, 2013, was introduced to provide an additional incentive to develop, commercialize and retain innovative patented technology in the U.K. This foreign intellectual property tax benefit enables the Companys U.K. operations to begin
to phase in a corporate tax rate of 10% on profits earned from qualifying products over four years beginning April1, 2013. The full benefit of the patent box tax regime will become available in April 2017. The Company has recorded in December
2015 a total patent box benefit of approximately $20million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2014 and 2015. It is reasonably possible that the benefit could be reviewed by the U.K. taxing authority and the amount of
benefit claimed could be adjusted. However, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that the tax positions taken by the Company, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, will be sustained upon examination based on the
technical merits of the positions and as such, no uncertain tax position has been recognized. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax
effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Based upon existing market conditions and the Companys earnings prospects,
it is anticipated that all deferred tax assets will be realized in future years. Significant components of the Companys net deferred tax assets liabilities are as follows: December31 2015 2014 In thousands Net current deferred tax assets Inventory 11,062 10,835 Inventory reserve 8,926 8,535 Allowance for doubtful accounts 1,578 1,022 Reserve for accrued liabilities 1,205 510 Other 1,842 2,667

Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested
and, accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal income taxes has been provided thereon. The estimate of 
58 Table of Contents
undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries amounted to $784 million as of December31, 2015. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise,
the Company may be subject to both U.S. income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is
not practicable. The Company paid $617 million, $699 million and $410 million in income taxes in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

8. Employee Benefit Plans 
The Company has a defined-contribution 401k plan covering domestic employees and a defined-contribution pension plan
covering certain foreign employees. The Company generally makes contributions to the plans equal to each participants eligible contributions for the plan year up to a specified percentage of the participants annual compensation. The
Companys contribution expense was $57 million, $59 million and $49 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
9. Commitments and Contingencies 
The Company leases certain offices, shop and warehouse facilities, automobiles and equipment. Total lease expense incurred
was $51 million, $42 million and $35 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Future annual minimum lease commitments at December31, 2015 are as follows: 2016$32 million; 2017$21 million; 2018$18 million;
2019$15 million; 2020$13 million; and thereafter$44 million. Brazilian Tax Issue 
From 2002 to 2007, the Companys Brazilian subsidiary imported goods through the State of Espirito Santo in Brazil and subsequently
transferred them to its facility in the State of Rio de Janeiro. During that period, the Companys Brazilian subsidiary paid taxes to the State of Espirito Santo on its imports. Upon the final sale of these goods, the Companys Brazilian
subsidiary collected taxes from customers and remitted them to the State of Rio de Janeiro net of the taxes paid on importation of those goods to the State of Espirito Santo in accordance with the Companys understanding of Brazilian tax laws.
In August 2007, the State of Rio de Janeiro served the Companys Brazilian subsidiary with assessments to collect a state tax on the
importation of goods through the State of Espirito Santo from 2002 to 2007 claiming that these taxes were due and payable to it under applicable law. The Company settled these assessments with payments to the State of Rio de Janeiro of $122 million
in March 2010 and $39 million in December 2010. 
59 Table of Contents
Approximately $78 million of these settlement payments were attributable to penalties, interest and amounts that had expired under the statute of limitations so that amount was recorded as an
expense. The remainder of the settlement payments generated credits recorded as a long-term prepaid tax to be used to offset future state taxes on sales to customers in the State of Rio de Janeiro, subject to certification by the tax authorities.
During the second quarter of 2015, the tax authorities certified approximately $83 million of those credits paid in 2010 and granted an additional $23 million in inflation-related credits. The additional amount of credits granted by the tax
authorities increased long-term prepaid taxes and decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by $23 million. In December
2010 and January 2011, the Companys Brazilian subsidiary was served with two additional assessments totaling approximately $130 million from the State of Rio de Janeiro to cancel the credits associated with the tax payments to the State of
Espirito Santo Santo Credits on the importation of goods from July 2005 to October 2007. The Santo Credits are not related to the credits described above. The Company has objected to these assessments on the grounds that they would
represent double taxation on the importation of the same goods and that the Company is entitled to the credits under applicable Brazilian law. With regard to the December 2010 assessment, the Companys Brazilian subsidiary filed an appeal with
a State of Rio de Janeiro judicial court to annul the tax assessment following a ruling against the Company by the tax administrations highest council. In connection with that appeal, the Company was required to deposit with the court
approximately $31 million in December 2014 as the full amount of the assessment with penalties and interest. The Company intends to file a similar appeal in the judicial system with regard to the January 2011 assessment as a result of a recent
ruling against the Company by the tax administrations highest council once that ruling is finalized. The Company believes that these credits are valid and that success in the judicial court process is probable. Based upon this analysis, the
Company has not accrued any liability in conjunction with this matter. Since 2007, the Companys Brazilian subsidiary has paid taxes
on the importation of goods directly to the State of Rio de Janeiro and the Company does not expect any similar issues to exist for periods subsequent to 2007. 
General The Company
operates its business and markets its products and services in most of the significant oil and gas producing areas in the world and is, therefore, subject to the risks customarily attendant to international operations and dependency on the condition
of the oil and gas industry. Additionally, products of the Company are used in potentially hazardous drilling, completion, and production applications that can cause personal injury, product liability and environmental claims. Although exposure to
such risk has not resulted in any significant problems in the past, there can be no assurance that ongoing and future developments will not adversely impact the Company. 
The Company is also involved in a number of legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. Although no assurance can be given with
respect to the ultimate outcome of such legal action, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability with respect thereto will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Chevron and its affiliated companies accounted for approximately 10% of the Companys total revenues and in 2013, Petrobras and its affiliated companies accounted for approximately 11% of the Companys total revenues. No other customer
accounted for more than 10% of the Companys total revenues in 2015, 2014 or 2013. 
11. Stockholders Equity 
Under a Stockholder Rights Plan adopted by the Board of Directors on November24, 2008, each share of common stock
includes one right to purchase from the Company a unit consisting of one one-hundredth of a share a Fractional Share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a specific purchase price per Fractional Share, subject to
adjustment in certain events. The rights will cause substantial dilution to any person or group that attempts to acquire the Company without the approval of the Companys Board of Directors. 
12. Stock-Based Compensation and Stock Awards 
Stock Options 
On May13, 2004, the Companys stockholders approved the 2004 Incentive Plan of Dril-Quip, Inc. as amended in 2012 and approved by
the Companys stockholders on May10, 2012, the 2004 Plan, which reserved up to 2,696,294 shares of common stock to be used in connection with the 2004 Plan. Persons eligible for awards under the 2004 Plan are employees
holding positions of responsibility with the Company or any of its subsidiaries and members of the Board of Directors. Options granted under the 2004 Plan have a term of ten years and become exercisable in cumulative annual increments of one-fourth
of the total number of shares of common stock subject thereto, beginning on the first anniversary of the date of the grant. The fair
value of stock options granted was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected life was based on the Companys historical trends, and volatility is based on the historical volatility over the expected
life of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yield curve at the grant date. The Company does not pay dividends and, therefore, there is no assumed dividend yield. 
Option activity for the year ended December31, 2015 was as follows: NumberofOptions WeightedAveragePrice Aggregateintrinsicvaluein millions  Lifein years Outstanding at December31, 2014 459,247 5586 Granted Exercised 38,500 5637 Forfeited 5,625 6823

Restricted Stock Awards 
On October28, 2015 and 2014, pursuant to the 2004 Plan, the Company awarded officers, directors and key employees restricted stock awards
RSA, which is an award of common stock subject to time vesting. In May 2012, the Board of Directors amended the 2004 Plan to include non-employee directors as eligible for RSAs. The awards issued under the 2004 Plan are restricted as to
transference, sale and other disposition. These RSAs vest ratably over a three year period. The RSAs may also vest in case of a change of control. Upon termination, whether voluntary or involuntary, the RSAs that have not vested will be returned to
the Company resulting in stock forfeitures. The fair market value of the stock on the date of grant is amortized and charged to selling, general and administrative expense over the stipulated time period over which the RSAs vest on a straight-line
basis, net of estimated forfeitures. The Companys RSA activity and related information is presented below: RSANumberofShares  Nonvested balance at December 31, 2014 160,154 9378 Granted 123,224 6602 Vested 79,797 8910 Forfeited 9,985 9629
