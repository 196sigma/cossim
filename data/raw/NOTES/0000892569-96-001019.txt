INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors
QLogic Corporation:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of QLogic
Corporation and subsidiary as of March 31, 1996 and April 2, 1995, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 1996. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of QLogic
Corporation and subsidiary as of March 31, 1996 and April 2, 1995, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended March 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
NOTE 1 BASIS OF PRESENTATION
QLogic Corporation QLogic or the Company is a supplier of Small
Computer Systems Interface SCSI Very Large Scale Integration VLSI
semiconductor chips. The Company designs and markets a full line of SCSI
application standard products.
Prior to December 28, 1992, Emulex Corporation Emulex operated its
micro devices business as a division EMD. On March 30, 1992, the Board of
Directors of Emulex approved in principle a plan of reorganization the
Reorganization Plan see note 9. Pursuant to the Reorganization Plan, QLogic
was formed as a separate corporation on November 18, 1992 and on December 28,
1992 exchanged 5,000,000 shares of its common stock for the net assets of EMD.
The exchange was accounted for as a Reorganization of entities under common
control, in a manner similar to a pooling of interests. Accordingly, QLogic
recorded the net assets acquired at Emulex historical carrying value of
$10,279.
On February 24, 1994 the Distribution Date, pursuant to the
Reorganization Plan, Emulex declared a special dividend consisting of the
distribution the Distribution to its stockholders of all outstanding shares
of common stock of QLogic. The purpose of the Distribution was to enable QLogic
to gain independent access to equity markets so that it may use its capital
stock as a source of funding for growth and acquisitions and to attract and
retain key employees. Costs related to the Distribution totaled approximately
$1,142 and were charged to expense during fiscal year 1994.
The accompanying financial statements for periods prior to the Distribution
are based on the specific assets and liabilities which were acquired by the
Company in the aforementioned reorganization and were prepared from the books
and records of Emulex using historical accounting principles.
Prior to the Distribution, Emulex performed various services on behalf of
QLogic. Such services included accounting, finance, treasury, legal and tax
advisory services. The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect an
allocation of costs related to those services. Management believes that the
basis of all such allocations is reasonable.
Prior to December 1994, QLogic did not have separately identified cash
balances. Emulex made all disbursements and cash collections on behalf of
QLogic. Prior to the transfer of assets to QLogic, transactions with Emulex were
accounted for in the Emulex investment. Subsequent to the transfer of assets,
but prior to the Distribution, transactions with Emulex were accounted for as a
receivable from Emulex. Subsequent to the Distribution, the receivable from
Emulex was closed out to additional paid-in capital.
NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts
of QLogic Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Fiscal Year
QLogic fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest March 31. Fiscal years 1996
and 1995 each comprised 52 weeks. Fiscal year 1994 comprised 53 weeks.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or net
realizable value.

20
QLOGIC CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation and
amortization are provided on the straight-line method over estimated useful
lives of two to seven years.
Goodwill
Goodwill represented the excess cost of net assets acquired over
liabilities assumed and was stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value,
less accumulated amortization. Amortization was provided on the straight-line
method over the periods expected to be benefited. Amortization of goodwill was
$99 for the year ended April 3, 1994.
Prior to the issuance in March 1995 of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of Statement No. 121, the Company assessed
the recoverability of intangible assets by determining whether the amortization
of the goodwill balance over its remaining life could be recovered through
projected non-discounted future net income. The amount of goodwill impairment,
if any, was measured based on projected discounted future net income streams
using a discount rate reflecting the Company average cost of capital.
Under the provisions of Statement No. 121, the Company now assesses the
recoverability of long-lived assets and certain identifiable related assets by
determining whether estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without
interest charges expected to result from the use of the assets and their
eventual disposition are less than the carrying amounts of the assets, in which
case an impairment loss is recognized. Otherwise, an impairment loss is not
recognized. Based upon such analysis, the Company believes there is no
impairment as of March 31, 1996.
The Company recorded goodwill related to the acquisition of the minority
interest in Computer Array Development, Inc. CAD in the amount of $1,327
assuming a useful life of ten years beginning February 1988. The Company has
continually evaluated the recoverability and possible existence of impairment of
the remaining unamortized goodwill balance based on forecasts of non-discounted
net income over the remaining amortization period of the goodwill. During the
quarter ended December 26, 1993, the Company completed a forecast of its
operations. The forecast showed a significant decrease in net income streams for
products tied to CAD technology due to management decision to change the
future product mix emphasizing a greater share of revenue from other products
which do not incorporate the CAD technology. Management decision was made in
part taking into consideration a first-time operating loss in the quarter ended
December 26, 1993 on products tied to the CAD technology and performance in the
quarter ended December 26, 1993 compared to the original plan.
The operating loss in the quarter ended December 26, 1993 was due primarily
to customers shifting their production to products containing devices
competitive with those marketed by QLogic. The forecast indicated that the
expected results no longer supported recoverability of the unamortized goodwill
and that a complete impairment of the asset in the amount of $542 had resulted.
The amount of the impairment was measured based on the discounted net income
streams over the remaining expected economic life of the asset, the discount
rate being indicative of the Company average cost of capital.
Accounting for Stock Options
In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Statement No. 123, which encourages, but does not require, a
fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options. Statement No.
123 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. While
the Company is still evaluating Statement No. 123, it currently expects to elect
to continue to measure compensation cost under APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees. Company management does not believe that
20
21
QLOGIC CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
the adoption of this new standard will have a material effect on the
consolidated financial statements of the Company.
Use of Estimates
Company management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating
to the reporting of assets and liabilities in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Revenue Recognition
QLogic recognizes revenue from the sale of product at the time of shipment.
Prior to the Distribution, sales to Emulex were based on the average sales price
of a product to non-affiliated customers. In instances where the only sales of a
given product were to Emulex, the price was based on the overall gross margin on
sales to non-affiliated customers for that quarter.
Sales of the Company products are generally recognized upon shipment.
Sales of the Company products to distributors are subject to a limited right
of return. A portion of sales to distributors, representing estimated returns,
is not recognized.
The Company generally warrants its products to be free from defects for
periods of one to five years from shipment. Estimated warranty expense is
recognized upon shipment of product.
Research and Development
Research and development costs, including costs related to the development
of new products and process technology, are expensed as incurred.
Income Taxes
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income
taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company was included in Emulex consolidated Federal and combined
state income tax group prior to the Distribution. The Company income taxes
were determined on a separate return basis.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
In December 1991, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of
Financial Instruments Statement No. 107, which requires all entities to
disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities
recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable
to estimate fair value. Statement No. 107 defines fair value of a financial
instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties. As of March 31, 1996, the fair value of all
financial instruments approximated carrying value.

Reverse Stock Split
On February 24, 1994, the Company declared a 1-for-2 reverse split of the
Company common stock. The par value remained $010 per share. All references
to the number of shares and per share information have been adjusted to reflect
the reverse stock split.
Net Income per Share
Net income per common and equivalent share for the years ended March 31,
1996 and April 2, 1995 was computed based on the weighted average number of
common and equivalent shares outstanding. The Company has granted certain stock
options see note 11 which have been treated as common stock equivalents in
computing both primary and fully diluted income per share. Primary income per
share approximates fully diluted income per share for the years ended March 31,
1996 and April 2, 1995.
Per share data has not been presented for periods prior to the Distribution
as the Company operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary.

QLOGIC CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
QLogic has approximately $1,085 of research and development credit
carryovers at March 31, 1996. If unused, these credits will expire in the years
2008 to 2011. In addition, the Company has approximately $92 of alternative
minimum tax credit carryovers which may be carried over indefinitely.
QLogic also has approximately $200 of net operating loss carryovers at
March 31, 1996. Utilization of these carryovers will be limited to approximately
$50 a year over the next four fiscal years, as a result of the Company filing
short period tax returns in 1994. Any unused carryover at the end of this period
will be fully utilizable in any future year until 2009, after which any unused
carryover will expire.
Based on the Company current and historical pre-tax earnings, management
believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefit of
the existing net deferred tax assets at March 31, 1996. Management believes the
existing net deductible temporary differences will reverse during periods in
which the Company generates net taxable income; however, there can be no
assurance that the Company will generate any earnings or any specific level of
continuing earnings in future years.
During fiscal year 1994, QLogic and Emulex entered into a Tax Sharing
Agreement for purposes of allocating pre-Distribution tax liabilities between
QLogic and Emulex. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, Emulex generally will be
liable for and will indemnify QLogic against a pre-Distribution Federal, state
and local tax liabilities of Emulex and its subsidiaries including QLogic, b
taxes or liabilities resulting from a breach of any covenant or representation
by Emulex contained in the Tax Sharing Agreement, c taxes imposed on QLogic or
its stockholders in the event that the Distribution is taxable due to any reason
other than a breach of certain covenants or representations by QLogic and d
taxes relating to the recapture or restoration or certain pre-Distribution tax
items such as depreciation recapture of Emulex or its subsidiaries. QLogic
will be liable for and will indemnify Emulex and its subsidiaries against i
post-Distribution Federal, state and local tax liabilities of QLogic, ii taxes
or liabilities resulting from a breach of any covenant or representation by
QLogic contained in the Tax Sharing Agreement, and iii taxes imposed on Emulex
in the event that the Distribution is taxable due to a breach of certain
covenants and representations by QLogic in the Tax Sharing Agreement unless,
prior to the breach, there is obtained, on the basis of valid representations,
1 a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service reasonably satisfactory to
Emulex, or 2 an opinion acceptable to Emulex from counsel such acceptance not
to be unreasonably withheld, provided that, if counsel for Emulex does not
concur with such opinion, Emulex refusal to accept such opinion will not be
considered unreasonable, in each case to the effect that the breach will not
cause the Distribution to become subject to Federal income tax. In any event, if
QLogic becomes liable to indemnify Emulex pursuant to these provisions, it is
likely that the liability will be material to QLogic.
The Tax Sharing Agreement provides that the party having responsibility for
a tax liability under the Tax Sharing Agreement generally will be primarily
responsible for, and bear the fees, costs and expenses including attorneys' and
accountants' fees of, the defense of an audit or other proceeding arising out
of or related to that tax liability.
The Tax Sharing Agreement also generally provides that, subject to certain
limitations, Emulex will pay to QLogic the net benefit realized by Emulex from
the carryback to tax years before the Distribution of certain tax attributes of
QLogic arising in tax years after the Distribution and QLogic will pay to Emulex
the net benefit realized by QLogic from the use after the Distribution Date of
certain tax attributes of Emulex arising in pre-Distribution tax years.
Accordingly, QLogic has recognized no deferred tax assets with respect to such
tax attributes.
The total amount due Emulex pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement at March
31, 1996 and April 2, 1995 totaled $1,760 and $1,209, respectively, and is
included in other non-current liabilities. Amounts due Emulex under the Tax
Sharing Agreement are payable on December 30, 1999, and bear interest,
commencing January 1, 1996, at the rate applicable to underpayments of Federal
income taxes, which was 9 percent at March 31, 1996. Interest due Emulex is
payable quarterly beginning in April 1996. The total amount of

NOTE 8 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Line of Credit
On July 10, 1995, the Company obtained an unsecured line of credit from a
bank. Maximum borrowings under the line of credit are $75 million subject to a
borrowing base based on accounts receivable and inventories, with a $1 million
sub-limit for letters of credit. Interest on outstanding advances is payable
monthly at the bank prime rate plus 05 percent. The line of credit expires on
July 5, 1996. The line of credit contains certain restrictive covenants that,
among other things, require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and
restrict the Company ability to incur additional indebtedness. The Company was
in compliance with all such covenants as of March 31, 1996. In the event of a
default under the line of credit, amounts outstanding would become secured by
substantially all of the assets of the Company. There were no borrowings under
the line of credit as of March 31, 1996. The Company is attempting to extend the
line of credit through the end of fiscal 1997.
Leases
The Company leases certain equipment under long-term non-cancelable capital
lease agreements which expire at various dates through the year 2000. The

Corporation Stock Awards Plan the Stock Awards Plan and the QLogic
Corporation Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan the Director Plan
collectively the Stock Option Plans, both of which became effective upon the
Distribution.
The Stock Awards Plan provides for the issuance of incentive and
non-qualified stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based incentive
awards for officers and key employees. The Stock Awards Plan permits the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to select eligible employees to
receive awards and to determine the terms and conditions of awards. A total of
1,100,000 shares were originally reserved for issuance under the Stock Awards
Plan; on August 22, 1995, 250,000 additional shares were authorized for a total
of 1,350,000 shares reserved for issuance under the Stock Awards Plan. As of
March 31, 1996, no shares of restricted stock were issued, options to purchase
761,998 shares of Common Stock were outstanding, and there were 581,109 shares
available for future grants.
In connection with the Distribution, each option to purchase Emulex common
stock Old Emulex Options was converted into two separately exercisable
options: one option to purchase Emulex common stock and one option to purchase
Company common stock New QLogic Options. The exercise price of Old Emulex
Options was allocated between the New QLogic Options based on relative stock
market prices of the underlying common stock.
Options granted under the Company Stock Awards Plan provide that an
employee holding a stock option may exchange stock which the employee already
owns as payment against the exercise of an option. This provision applies to all
options outstanding at March 31, 1996.
Under the terms of the Director Plan, each eligible director received an
initial grant of stock options effective as of the Distribution Date. New
directors receive, at fair market value, an option to purchase 12,500 shares of
common stock of the Company upon election to the Board. A total of 125,000
shares have been reserved for issuance under the Director Plan. As of March 31,
1996, options for a total of 87,500 shares were outstanding and the remaining
