ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Directors and Shareholders of
MKS Instruments, Inc.   We have completed an integrated audit of MKS Instruments, Inc. 2004
consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits,
are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under a1 present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of MKS Instruments, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31,
2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index
appearing under a2 presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
Internal control over financial reporting
Also, in our opinion, management assessment, included in Management
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item
9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on criteria established in Internal
Control -- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal Control -- Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Company
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
management assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of
internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting
includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external
33 purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iii provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MKS
Instruments, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries the Company. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
NET INCOME PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding, and diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common
equivalent shares outstanding. The dilutive effect of options is determined
under the treasury stock method using the average market price for the period.
Common equivalent shares are included in the per share calculations when the
effect of their inclusion would be dilutive.
The following is a reconciliation of basic to diluted net income per share                           FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
2004     2003     2002

ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, are excluded from the
calculation of diluted net income loss per common share because their
inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has several stock-based employee compensation plans. The
Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic value
method as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations.

Accordingly, no compensation expense is recorded for options issued to employees
in fixed amounts with fixed exercise prices at least equal to the fair market
value of the Company common stock at the date of grant. The Company has
adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure, SFAS 123 through disclosure only.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and net income per

Diluted -- Pro  $  099  $ 074 $ 114   There is no tax benefit included in the stock-based employee compensation
expense determined under the fair-value-based method for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, as the Company had a full valuation allowance for
its net deferred tax assets during 2002 and 2003. For 2004, stock-based employee
compensation expense included a tax benefit.
The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during 2004,
2003 and 2002 was $1124, $1591 and $1422 per option, respectively. The fair
value of options at the date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions                                2004  2003  2002

in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $705, $708 and $935, respectively. The fair value
of the employees' purchase rights was estimated using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions                                2004  2003  2002

FOREIGN EXCHANGE
The functional currency of the majority of the Company foreign
subsidiaries is the applicable local currency. For those subsidiaries, assets
and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates.
Income and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rates
prevailing during the year. The resulting translation adjustments are included
in accumulated other comprehensive income in consolidated stockholders' equity.
Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses were immaterial in 2004, 2003 and
2002.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue from product sales is recorded upon transfer of title and risk of
loss to the customer provided that there is evidence of an arrangement, the
sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable
is reasonably assured. In most transactions, the Company has no obligations to
customers after the date products are shipped other than pursuant to warranty
obligations. In some instances, the Company provides installation and training
to customers after the product has been shipped. In accordance with the Emerging
Issues Task Force EITF 00-21 Accounting For Revenue Arrangements With
Multiple Deliverables, the Company allocates the revenue between the multiple
elements based upon fair value and defers the revenue related to the undelivered
elements until the installation or training is complete. Fair value is the price
charged when the element is sold separately. The Company provides for the
estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of
the related revenue. Shipping and handling fees, if any, billed to customers are
recognized as revenue. The related shipping and handling costs are recognized in
cost of sales. Accounts receivable allowances include sales returns and bad debt
allowances. The Company monitors and tracks the amount of product returns and
reduces revenue at the time of shipment for the estimated amount of such future
returns, based on historical experience. The Company makes estimates evaluating
its allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company continuously monitors
collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for
estimated credit losses based upon its historical experience and any specific
customer collection issues that it has identified.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS
All highly liquid investments with a maturity date of three months or less
at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.
The fair value of short-term available-for-sale investments with maturities
or estimated lives of less than one year consists of the following                                 DECEMBER 31,

The appropriate classification of investments in securities is determined
at the time of purchase. Debt securities that the Company does not have the
intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as available-for-sale
and are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on securities
classified as available-for-sale are included in accumulated other comprehensive
income in consolidated stockholders' equity. Gross unrealized gains and gross
unrealized losses on available-for-sale investments were not material at
December 31, 2004 and 2003. Realized gains losses on securities were
immaterial in 2004, 2003 and 2002. The cost of securities sold is based on the
specific identification method.
INVENTORIES
The Company values its inventory at the lower of cost first-in, first-out
method or market. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand
and records a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to its
estimated net realizable value, if less than cost, based primarily on its
estimated forecast of product demand.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Equipment acquired under
capital leases is recorded at the present value of the minimum lease payments
required during the lease period. Expenditures for major renewals and
betterments that extend the useful lives of property, plant and equipment are
capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain
or loss is recognized in earnings.
Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of twenty to thirty-one and one-half years for buildings and three
to seven years for machinery and equipment and furniture and fixtures. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated
useful life of the leased asset.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by management based on the
fair value of assets received. These include acquired customer lists,
technology, patents, trade name, and covenants not to compete. Intangible assets
are amortized from three to eight years on a straight-line basis which
represents the estimated periods of benefit.
GOODWILL
Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of acquired net assets exceeded
the fair value of those net assets on the date of acquisition. Through December
31, 2001, the Company amortized goodwill on a straight-line
42
MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
TABLES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
basis over its expected useful life of 5 to 7 years. As of January 1, 2002 the
Company ceased amortizing goodwill in compliance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS
142.
The Company assesses goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the
fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently when events and
circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If
the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair
value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the
carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss
is recorded equal to that excess.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets which
include acquired amortizable intangible assets, in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144. SFAS 144 requires recognition of
impairment of long-lived assets in the event the net book value of such assets
exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. If an
impairment is indicated, the assets are written down to their estimated fair
value.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist mainly
of compensation related expenses and project materials. The Company research
and development efforts include numerous projects which generally have a
duration of 12 to 30 months.
IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Company values tangible and intangible assets acquired through its
business acquisitions at fair value including in-process research and
development IPR. The Company determines IPR through established
valuation techniques for various projects for the development of new products
and technologies and expenses IPR when technical feasibility is not reached.
ADVERTISING COSTS
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs were
immaterial in 2004, 2003 and 2002.
INCOME TAXES
The Company records income taxes using the asset and liability method.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income
tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company
evaluates the realizability of its net deferred tax assets and assesses the need
for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. The future benefit to be derived
from its deferred tax assets is dependent upon its ability to generate
sufficient future taxable income to realize the assets. The Company records a
valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to the amount that may
be more likely than not to be realized. To the extent the Company establishes a
valuation allowance, an expense will be recorded within the provision for income
taxes line on the statement of income. During the year ended December 31, 2002
the Company established a full valuation allowance for its net deferred tax
assets. In periods subsequent to establishing a valuation allowance, if the
Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its net deferred tax
assets in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation
allowance would be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense in the period
such determination

was made. During the fourth quarter of 2004, after examining a number of
factors, including historical results and near term earnings projections, the
Company determined that it was more likely than not that it would realize all of
its net deferred tax assets, except for those related to certain state tax
credits and adjusted the valuation allowance at December 31, 2004.
On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act was
signed into law. The Act contains a provision allowing U.S. multinational
companies a one-time incentive to repatriate foreign earnings at an effective
tax rate of 525%. The Company has started an evaluation of the effects of the
repatriation provision but does not anticipate it will complete this evaluation
until some time after Congress and Treasury issue further guidance. Through
December 31, 2004, the Company has not provided deferred income taxes on the
undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because such earnings were
intended to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. Determination of the
potential deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not
practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances
existing if and when remittance occurs. At December 31, 2004 the Company had
$50,037,549 of undistributed earnings in its foreign subsidiaries.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In March 2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 03-1, The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments
EITF 03-1, which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on
debt and equity investments. Additionally, EITF 03-1 includes new disclosure
requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. In
September 2004, the FASB delayed the accounting provisions of EITF 03-1;
however, the disclosure requirements remain effective and have been adopted for
the Company fiscal year ended December 31, 2004. The Company will evaluate the
effect, if any, of EITF 03-1 when final guidance is released.
In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 151, Inventory Costs SFAS 151. SFAS 151 amends ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing. This statement clarifies the accounting for
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted
material, and requires those items be recognized as current period charges
regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal. In addition,
this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the
costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently assessing the
potential impact of SFAS 151.
In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R replaces SFAS
123 and supersedes APB 25. SFAS 123R focuses primarily on the accounting for
transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment
transactions. SFAS 123R requires companies to recognize in the statement of
operations the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of
equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards with
limited exceptions. This statement is effective as of the first reporting
period that begins after June 15, 2005. Accordingly, the Company will adopt SFAS
123R in its third quarter of fiscal 2005 and expects to use the
modified-prospective transition method and will not restate prior periods for
the adoption of SFAS 123R. Although the Company is currently evaluating the
provisions of SFAS 123R and its implications on its employee benefit plans, it
believes that the adoption of this standard, based on the terms of the options
outstanding at December 31, 2004, will have a material effect on net income in
the second half of 2005.

USE OF ESTIMATES
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation
of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an
on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including
those related to revenue recognition, inventory, intangible assets, goodwill,
and other long-lived assets, in-process research and development, merger
expenses, income taxes and investments. Management bases its estimates and
judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to be consistent with the
current year classifications.
3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT
The Company hedges a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated
intercompany sales of inventory, over a maximum period of fifteen months, using
forward exchange contracts and currency options primarily related to Japanese
and European currencies. These derivatives are designated as cash-flow hedges,
and changes in their fair value are carried in accumulated other comprehensive
income until the hedged transaction affects earnings. When the hedged
transaction affects earnings, the appropriate gain or loss from the derivative
designated as a hedge of the transaction is reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income to cost of sales. As of December 31, 2004, the amount that
will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to cost of
sales over the next twelve months is an unrealized loss of $991,000, net of
taxes. The ineffective portion of the derivatives is recorded in cost of sales
and was immaterial in 2004, 2003 and 2002.
The Company hedges certain intercompany and other payables with foreign
exchange contracts and currency options. Since these derivatives hedge existing
amounts that are denominated in foreign currencies, the derivatives do not
qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133. The foreign exchange gain on
these derivatives was immaterial in 2004, 2003 and 2002.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on forward exchange contracts and
local currency purchased option contracts that do not qualify for hedge
accounting are recognized immediately in earnings. The cash flows resulting from
forward exchange contracts and local currency purchased options that qualify for
hedge accounting are classified in the statement of cash flows as part of cash
flows from operating activities. Cash flows resulting from forward exchange
contracts and local currency purchased options that do not qualify for hedge
accounting are classified in the statement of cash flows as investing
activities. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments
for trading purposes.
There were forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling
$26,301,000 outstanding at December 31, 2004. Of such forward exchange
contracts, $21,550,000 were outstanding to exchange Japanese yen for U.S.
dollars. There were forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling
$41,018,000 outstanding at December 31, 2003 of which $32,488,000 were
outstanding to exchange Japanese yen for US dollars. There were forward exchange
contracts with notional amounts totaling $23,287,000 outstanding at December 31,
2002 of which $17,213,000 were outstanding to exchange Japanese yen for U.S.
dollars. Local

currency purchased options with notional amounts totaling $5,053,000 to exchange
foreign currencies for U.S. dollars were outstanding at December 31, 2002. There
were no local currency purchased options outstanding at December 31, 2004 and
2003.
Foreign exchange gains on forward exchange contracts which did not qualify
for hedge accounting were immaterial during 2004, 2003 and 2002. Gains and
losses on forward exchange contracts and local currency purchased options that
qualify for hedge accounting are classified in cost of goods sold and totaled a
loss of $1,666,000 and $1,411,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003
and a gain of $452,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002.
The fair values of forward exchange contracts at December 31, 2004 and
2003, determined by applying period end currency exchange rates to the notional
contract amounts, amounted to an unrealized loss of $1,479,000 and $2,081,000,
respectively. The fair values of local currency purchased options at December
31, 2002 were immaterial. There were no purchased options outstanding at
December 31, 2004 or 2003.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
The Company significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally
of cash and cash equivalents, investments, forward exchange contracts, and trade
accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with
financial institutions including some banks with which it has borrowings. The
Company maintains investments primarily in U.S. Treasury and government agency
securities and corporate debt securities, rated AA or higher. The Company places
forward currency contracts with high credit-quality financial institutions in
order to minimize credit risk exposure. The Company customers are primarily
concentrated in the semiconductor industry, and a limited number of customers
account for a significant portion of the Company revenues. The Company
regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and believes it has
adequately provided for potential credit loss exposures. Credit is extended for
all customers based on financial condition and collateral is not required.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The fair value of the term loans, including the current portion,
approximates its carrying value given its variable rate interest provisions. The
fair value of marketable securities is based on quoted market prices. The fair
value of mortgage notes is based on borrowing rates for similar instruments and
approximates its carrying value. For all other balance sheet financial
instruments, the carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short
period to maturity of these instruments.

6 DEBT
CREDIT AGREEMENTS AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS
On August 3, 2004, the Company entered into an unsecured short-term LIBOR
based loan agreement with a bank to be utilized primarily by its Japanese
subsidiary for short-term liquidity purposes. The credit line, which expires on
August 1, 2005, provides for the Company to borrow in multiple currencies of up
to an equivalent of $35,000,000 U.S. dollars. At December 31, 2004, the Company
had outstanding borrowings of $14,608,000 U.S. dollars, payable on demand, at an
interest rate of 130%.
Additionally, the Company Japanese subsidiary has lines of credit and
short-term borrowing arrangements with various financial institutions which
provide for aggregate borrowings as of December 31, 2004 of up to $30,191,000,
which generally expire and are renewed at three month intervals. At December 31,
2004 and 2003, total borrowings outstanding under these arrangements were
$7,790,000 and $17,736,000, respectively, at interest rates of 124% at December

In connection with the purchase of Telvac Engineering, Ltd., the Company
issued term loans of $752,000. Principal payments of $61,000 were due on an
annual basis through December 1, 2004 with the remaining principal due on May 1,
2005. Interest is payable semi-annually at the UK base rate. The fixed interest
rate for the term loan is 40% and the remaining principal due as of December

invalid, unenforceable and not infringed by MKS or its products. On March 1,
2005, the parties agreed to dismiss the case, without prejudice. Accordingly,
the court dismissed the case on March 11, 2005.
On January 12, 2004, Gas Research Institute GRI brought suit in federal
district court in Illinois against MKS, On-Line Technologies, Inc. On-Line
which MKS acquired in 2001, and another defendant, Advanced Fuel Research, Inc.
AFR, for breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets and related
claims relating to certain infra-red gas analysis technology allegedly developed
under a January 1995 Contract for Research between GRI and AFR. The technology
was alleged to have been incorporated into certain of MKS' products. GRI made
claims for damages, exemplary damages, attorney fees and costs and injunctive
relief. MKS filed an answer, denying liability and asserting various defenses to
GRI claims. MKS also asserted a cross-claim against co-defendant AFR, alleging
misrepresentation, breach of contract and breach of various duties owed by AFR,
and alleging that in the event MKS and On-Line are held liable to GRI, AFR would
be required to reimburse, indemnify, and hold harmless On-Line and us for any
such liability. On November 9, 2004, the parties entered into a settlement
agreement and the court dismissed the case, including cross-claims, pursuant to
the settlement.
On April 3, 2003, Advanced Energy filed suit against MKS in federal
district court in Colorado Colorado Action, seeking a declaratory judgment
that Advanced Energy Xstream product does not infringe three patents held by
MKS' subsidiary, Applied Science and Technology, Inc. ASTeX. On May 14,
2003, MKS brought suit in federal district court in Delaware against Advanced
Energy for infringement of five ASTeX patents, including the three patents at
issue in the Colorado Action. MKS sought injunctive relief and damages for
Advanced Energy infringement. These lawsuits are unrelated to the Advanced
Energy litigation described above. On December 24, 2003, the Colorado court
granted our motion to transfer Advanced Energy Colorado Action to Delaware. In
connection with the jury trial, the parties agreed to present the jury with
representative claims from three of the five ASTeX patents. On July 23, 2004,
the jury found that Advanced Energy infringed all three patents. MKS has filed a
motion for a permanent injunction, which is pending before the court and the
parties are currently briefing post-trial motions in that case. The parties are
also awaiting a trial with respect to damages and associated claims of MKS and
certain remaining affirmative defenses and related claims of Advanced Energy.
That trial date has not yet been scheduled.
On November 30, 2000, ASTeX, which was acquired by MKS in January 2001,
brought suit in federal district court in Delaware against Advanced Energy for
infringement of ASTeX patent related to its Astron product. On May 17, 2002, a
jury affirmed the validity of the Company patent and found that Advanced
Energy infringed the patent. On May 31, 2002, based on the jury findings, the
Court entered a judgment on the infringement claim in favor of the Company and
against Advanced Energy, and awarded $4,200,000 in damages to compensate the
Company for Advanced Energy infringing activity. Advanced Energy filed motions
to overturn the verdict. During August of 2002, the Company and Advanced Energy
entered into an agreement whereby Advanced Energy agreed to pay the awarded
damages amount to the Company and withdraw its motions to overturn the verdict.
The Company received the $4,200,000 in September 2002, and recorded the amount
as Income from litigation settlement.
On November 3, 1999, On-Line brought suit in federal district court in
Connecticut against Perkin-Elmer, Inc. and certain other defendants for
infringement of On-Line patent related to its FTIR spectrometer product and
related claims. The suit sought injunctive relief and damages for infringement.
Perkin-Elmer, Inc. filed a counterclaim seeking invalidity of the patent, costs
and attorneys' fees. In June 2002, the defendants filed a motion for summary
judgment. In April 2003, the court granted the motion and dismissed the case.
MKS appealed this decision to the federal circuit court of appeals. On October
13, 2004, the federal circuit court of appeals reversed the lower court
dismissal of certain claims in the case.

Accordingly, the case has been remanded to the United States District Court in
Connecticut for further proceedings on the merits of the remaining claims. On
March 11, 2005, Perkin-Elmer, Inc. submitted to the court a stipulation agreeing
that they have infringed a specified claim of On-Line patent and filed a
motion for summary judgment that such patent claim is invalid. On-Line intends
to file a reply to the summary judgment motion in the next few weeks. The
parties will then await the court response to the motion.
The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims, which have
arisen in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the
ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on
the Company results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
The Company leases certain of its facilities and machinery and equipment
under capital and operating leases expiring in various years through 2004 and

As of December 31, 2004, the Company has entered into non-cancelable
purchase commitments for certain inventory components and other equipment and
services used in its normal operations. The majority of these purchase
commitments covered by these arrangements are for periods of less than one year
and aggregate to approximately $63,563,000. Additionally, the Company has
engaged a third party to provide certain computer equipment, IT network services
and IT support. This contract is for a period of approximately six years
beginning in September 2004 and has a significant penalty for early termination.
The obligation of approximately $27,100,000 will be paid over the term of the
arrangement. Annualized payments are expected to be approximately $5,000,000.
To the extent permitted by Massachusetts law, the Company Restated
Articles of Organization, as amended, requires the Company to indemnify any
current or former officer or director of the Company or any person who has
served or is serving in any capacity with respect to any employee benefit plan
of the Company. Because no claim for indemnification has been pursued by any
person covered by the relevant provisions of the Company Restated Articles of
Organization, the Company believes that its estimated exposure for these
indemnification obligations is currently minimal. Accordingly, the Company has
no liabilities recorded for these requirements as of December 31, 2004.
The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in the ordinary
course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds
harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or
incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company customers, in
connection with any patent, any other intellectual property infringement claim,
or other specified claims, by any third party with respect to the Company
products. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual
any time after execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of
future payments the Company could be required to make under these
indemnification agreements is unlimited. The

Company has never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to
these indemnification agreements. As a result, the Company believes the
estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, the Company
has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2004.
When as part of an acquisition, the Company acquires all of the stock or
all of the assets and liabilities of another company, the Company assumes
liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of
acquisition. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could
be required to make for such obligations is undeterminable at this time. Other
than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of the acquisition,
historically the Company has not made significant payments for these
indemnifications. Accordingly, no liabilities have been recorded for these
obligations.
In conjunction with certain asset sales, the Company may provide routine
indemnifications whose terms range in duration and often are not explicitly
defined. Where appropriate, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded
as a liability. Because the amount of liability under these types of
indemnifications is not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of the
obligation under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Other
than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of the asset sale,
historically the Company has not made significant payments for these
indemnifications.

the 2004 Plan. As of January 1, 2005, there were 2,691,955 shares available for
future issuance under the 2004 Plan, which amount shall increase each year by an
amount equal to 5% of the total outstanding shares of the Company common stock
outstanding on January 1 of such year, provided that the maximum aggregate

issuance thereunder. As of January 1, 2005, 15,000,000 shares of common stock
were authorized for issuance thereunder. Pursuant to the terms of the 1995 Plan,
the number of shares available for issuance under the 1995 Plan has increased
annually by an amount equal to 5% of the total outstanding shares of the
Company common stock outstanding on January 1 of such year, provided that that
the maximum aggregate number of common stock which may be issued under the 1995
Plan is 15,000,000 shares subject to adjustment for certain changes in MKS'
capitalization. Pursuant to the 1995 Plan, the Company may grant options,
restricted stock or other stock-based awards to employees, officers, directors,
consultants and advisors. In March 2002, the board of directors approved, and in
May 2002, the shareholders approved an increase in the number of shares that may
be granted under the 1995 Plan to the current 15,000,000 shares. The 1995 Plan
will expire in November 2005. As of December 31, 2004 there were 2,879,864
shares reserved for future issuance under the 1995 Plan.
The Company 1997 Director Stock Plan the 1997 Director Plan provides

to each person who first becomes an outside director and ii annual grants of
options to purchase 12,000 shares of common stock on the date of the annual
meeting of shareholders. In December 2004, the board of directors amended the
1997 Director Plan to allow for all options granted on or after May 17, 2000 to
be exercisable within the three year period from the date of the director
termination as director. On March 4, 2004, the board of directors approved, and
on May 13, 2004, the shareholders approved, an increase in the number of shares
available for issuance under the 1997 Director Plan from 300,000 shares to
750,000 shares. As of December 31, 2004 there were 475,500 shares reserved for
future issuance under the 1997 Director Plan.
On January 7, 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of outstanding
options with an exercise price of $2300 or greater. As a result of this action,
options to purchase approximately 16 million shares became exercisable on
January 7, 2005. No compensation expense will be recorded in 2005 related to
this action as these options had no intrinsic value on January 7, 2005. Under
the recently issued SFAS 123R, the Company will be required to apply the expense
recognition provisions under SFAS 123R beginning July 1, 2005. The reason that
the Company accelerated the vesting of the identified stock options was to
reduce the Company compensation charge in periods subsequent to June 30, 2005.

against the Company net deferred tax assets. This valuation allowance was
maintained because the Company determined that it was more likely than not that
all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized.

TABLES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
During the year ended December 31, 2004, after examining a number of
factors, including historical results and near term earnings projections, the
Company determined that it was more likely than not that it would realize all of
its net deferred tax assets, except for those related to certain state tax
credits.
As a result of this analysis the Company reduced its valuation allowance by
$20,063,000 at December 31, 2004 resulting in a net deferred tax asset of
$14,313,000. Of the total tax benefit from the reversal of the valuation
allowance, $3,850,000 was recorded as a reduction of goodwill and $5,271,000 was
recorded to additional paid-in capital for the tax benefit from the exercise of
stock options during both the current and prior years. The remaining valuation
allowance of $2,870,000 relates to state tax credits for which it is more likely
than not that they will not be realized.
At December 31, 2004, the Company had federal net operating loss
carryforwards of $4,681,000, including approximately $1,636,000 the utilization
of which may be limited by the change in ownership rules under Section 382 of
the Internal Revenue Code Section 382. The Company also had federal general
business and minimum tax credit carryforwards credit carryforwards of
$5,791,000 and $841,000 respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2004, the
Company had approximately $9,624,000 of state net operating loss carryforwards.
The federal net operating losses and general business credit carryforwards begin
to expire in 2021 and 2012, respectively. The state net operating loss
carryforwards begin to expire in 2008. Under the provisions of Section 382,
certain substantial changes in the Company ownership may result in a
limitation on the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards that can
be used in future periods.
On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act was
signed into law. The Act contains a provision allowing U.S. multinational
companies a one-time incentive to repatriate foreign earnings at an effective
tax rate of 525%. The Company has started an evaluation of the effects of the
repatriation provision but does not anticipate it will complete this evaluation
until some time after Congress and Treasury issue further guidance. Through
December 31, 2004, the Company has not provided deferred income taxes on the
undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because such earnings were
intended to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. Determination of the
potential deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not
practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances
existing if and when remittance occurs. At December 31, 2004 the Company had
$50,037,549 of undistributed earnings in its foreign subsidiaries.
10 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has a 401k profit-sharing plan for U.S. employees meeting
certain requirements in which eligible employees may contribute between 1% and
20% of their annual compensation to this plan, and, with respect to employees
who are age 50 and older, certain specified additional amounts, limited by an
annual maximum amount determined by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company,
at its discretion, may provide a matching contribution which will generally
match up to the first 2% of each participant compensation, plus 25% of the
next 4% of compensation. At the discretion of the board of directors, the
Company may also make additional contributions for the benefit of all eligible
employees. The Company contributions were $1,685,000, $1,503,000 and
$1,938,000 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
The Company maintains a bonus plan which provides cash awards to key
employees, at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of
directors, based upon operating results and employee performance. The bonus
expense was $4,617,000 in 2004, was immaterial in 2003 and there was no bonus
expense in 2002.
The Company provides supplemental retirement benefits for certain of its
officers and executive officers. This obligation was not material at December
31, 2004.

footprint. The purchase price was $2,150,000 and was accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting. The purchase price was primarily allocated to the
assets acquired based upon their estimated fair values, with the full purchase
price being allocated to intangible assets as completed technology. This
intangible asset is being amortized over its estimated useful life of 5 years.
The results of operations are included in the Company consolidated statement

On January 31, 2002, MKS completed its acquisition of the ENI Business
ENI of Emerson Electric Co., a supplier of solid-state RF and DC plasma
power supplies, matching networks and instrumentation to the semiconductor and
thin-film processing industries. The reasons for the acquisition of ENI were
based upon the ability to offer higher value and more integrated application
solutions by combining ENI solid-state power conversion technology with the
Company core competency in plasma and reactive gas solutions. The acquisition
has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The purchase
price was approximately $266,530,000 and consisted of approximately 12,000,000
shares of MKS common stock valued at approximately $261,264,000 and transaction
expenses of approximately $5,266,000. The value of MKS common stock was
approximately $217720 per share based on the average closing price of MKS'
common stock for the five-day period including the date of the announcement of
the signing of the merger agreement and the two days preceding and succeeding
such date.
The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired based upon their
estimated fair values and resulted in an allocation of approximately
$197,123,000 to goodwill. The results of operations are included in the
Company consolidated statement of income as of and since the date of the
purchase. The allocation of the purchase price is as follows

years for completed technology, eight years for patents, and eight years for
customer relationships. The total weighted average amortizable life of the
acquired intangible assets is six years. Approximately $9,700,000 of the
goodwill is tax deductible.
In connection with the acquisition of ENI, the Company obtained an
appraisal from an independent appraiser of the fair value of its intangible
assets. This appraisal valued purchased in-process research and

development IPR of various projects for the development of new products
and technologies at approximately $7,500,000. Because the technological
feasibility of products under development had not been established and no future
alternative uses existed, the purchased IPR was expensed during the six months
ended June 30, 2002. The value of the purchased IPR was determined using the
income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under
development to their net present value. Each project was analyzed to determine
the technological innovations included; the utilization of core technology; the
complexity, cost and time to complete development; any alternative future use or
current technological feasibility; and the stage of completion. The cash flows
derived from the IPR projects were discounted at rates ranging from 25% to
30%. The Company believes these rates were appropriate given the risks
associated with the technologies for which commercial feasibility had not been
established. The percentage of completion for each in-process project was
determined by identifying the cost incurred to date of the project as a ratio of
the total estimated cost required to bring the project to technical and
commercial feasibility. The percentage of completion for in-process projects
acquired ranged from 65% to 80%, based on management estimates of tasks
completed and the tasks to be completed to bring the projects to technological
and commercial feasibility. The projects were generally expected to have
durations of up to 12 months. The significant projects were completed within
their scheduled 12-month timeframe.
On March 13, 2002, MKS acquired Tenta Technology, Ltd. Tenta, a
privately held company that designs and supplies modular, computer-based process
control systems for 300mm semiconductor process tool applications. The reasons
for the acquisition were based upon the ability to offer higher value and more
integrated application solutions by integrating Tenta process controllers with
MKS digital network products to provide a more complete process control
solution. The acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting. The purchase price was approximately $26,400,000 and consisted of
700,000 shares of MKS common stock valued at approximately $21,100,000, cash of
$5,000,000 and transaction expenses of approximately $300,000. The value of MKS
common stock was based on the average closing price of MKS' common stock for the
five-day period including the date of the announcement of the signing of the
merger agreement and the two days preceding and succeeding such date. The
purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired based upon their estimated
fair values. The results of operations are included in the Company
consolidated statement of income as of and since the date of the purchase. The

In 2002, the Company acquired two other privately held companies for a
total purchase price of $12,200,000, including IPC Fab Automation GmbH, a
developer and provider of web-based hardware and software that enable
e-diagnostics and advanced process control for advanced manufacturing
applications. There were no shares of MKS common stock issued for these
acquisitions. Goodwill recognized in these transactions was approximately
$11,000,000 and acquired intangible assets were approximately $2,800,000.
Acquired intangibles are being amortized over a weighted average of six years.

charges for purchased IPR were not included in the unaudited pro forma
results, because they were non-recurring and directly related to the

13 SALE OF ASSETS
In August 2001, the Company sold certain assets for proceeds of
approximately $9,000,000, consisting of approximately $4,700,000 in cash 3,900,000 in a note receivable, and $200,000 of warrants. The note receivable
had an annual interest rate of 90% and was scheduled to mature on August 7,
2004. The loss on the transaction was $1,246,000 before taxes. During 2002, due
to the downturn in the semiconductor industry and its result on the acquirer
operations, and the acquirer inability to raise financing, the Company
considered the value of the note and warrants to be impaired. Accordingly,
during 2002, MKS recorded a charge of $4,121,000 to other expense for the
Company estimate of the impairment on the note receivable and warrants. During
2004, the Company received $5,042,000 related to the collection of the note
receivable and accrued interest. This amount was recorded as a gain and included
in other income.
During 2002, the Company sold an investment in a company for approximately
$2,500,000. The gain on the transaction was not material.
14 RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES
As a result of our various acquisitions from 2000 through 2002 and the
downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment market which began in 2000, we
had redundant activities and excess manufacturing capacity and office space.
Therefore in 2002, and continuing through the first quarter of 2004, we
implemented restructuring activities to rationalize manufacturing operations and
reduce operating expenses. As a result of these actions, the Company recorded
restructuring and asset impairment charges of $2,726,000 in 2002. The charges
consisted of $631,000 of severance costs related to a workforce reduction 1,228,000 related to consolidation of leased facilities, and an asset
impairment charge of $867,000 primarily related to the impairment of an
intangible asset from the discontinuance of certain product development
activities. The fair value of the impaired intangible asset was determined using
the expected present value of future cash flows. The workforce reduction was
across all functional groups and consisted of 225 employees.
During 2003, the Company continued its consolidation of recent acquisitions
that it initiated in 2002, and recorded restructuring, asset impairment and
other charges of $1,593,000. The charges in 2003 consisted of $356,000 of
severance costs related to workforce reductions, $1,145,000 of lease cost,
professional fees and other costs related to facility consolidations and an
asset impairment charge of $92,000. The workforce reduction was across all
functional groups.

15 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002.
Accordingly, the Company ceased the ratable amortization of goodwill on that
date. In addition, the Company reassessed the classification of its goodwill and
intangible assets. This analysis, which was completed during the quarter ended
March 31, 2002, resulted in the reclassification of workforce related intangible
assets of $2,023,000 to goodwill. Also, in accordance with this statement, the
Company reassessed the useful lives of its amortizable intangible assets and
determined that the lives were appropriate.
The Company is required to perform an annual impairment test of its
goodwill under the provisions of SFAS 142. SFAS 142 requires that companies
identify and assess goodwill at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are
defined as operating segments or one level below an operating segment, referred
to as a component. The Company has determined that its reporting units are
components of its operating segment. The Company allocates goodwill to reporting
units at the time of acquisition and bases that allocation on which reporting
units will benefit from the acquired assets and liabilities. The fair value of
each reporting unit with goodwill is compared to its recorded book value. An
excess of book value over fair value indicates that an impairment of goodwill
exists. Fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis of expectations
of future earnings for each of the reporting units with goodwill. The Company
completed its annual impairment for 2004 in the fourth quarter. No adjustment to
goodwill was necessary.
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003 were as follows                                    YEAR ENDED

engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively
monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company
warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, utilization levels,
material usage, and supplier warranties on parts delivered to the Company.
Should actual product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, or
supplier warranties on parts differ from the Company estimates, revisions to
the estimated warranty liability would be required.

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
EFFECTIVENESS OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
MKS' management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of December 31, 2004. The term disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act, means controls and other
procedures of a
64 company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company
management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their
objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the
cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the
evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2004,
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of
such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
reasonable assurance level.
MANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The management of MKS is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15f and 15d-15f promulgated under
the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
company principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by
the company board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and
procedures that   - Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company   - Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
- Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, MKS'
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework.
Based on our assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31,
2004, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those
criteria.
Our management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which appears on pages 33 and 34.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting as
defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act that occurred
during the quarter ended December 31, 2004 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
