To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Premisys Communications, Inc.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the
related consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity and of
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Premisys Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries at June 30, 1997 and 1998,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended June 30, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 - THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company
Premisys Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries,  together, the
Company, design, manufacture and market integrated digital access products
for telecommunications service providers. The Company products assist domestic
and international public carriers in building, expanding and managing their
worldwide telecommunications networks for their business customers.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Management estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Premisys
Communications,  Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
Cash and cash equivalents include cash, money market funds and certain
municipal securities with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. The
Company determines the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities
at the time of purchase and reassesses the classification at each reporting
date. All of the Company short-term investments, consisting principally of
municipal securities, have been classified as available-for-sale. Under this
classification the investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains
and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of
stockholders' equity. At June 30, 1997 and 1998, such unrealized gains and
losses were not significant.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being
determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range
from two years for computer equipment and purchased software to five years for
machinery and equipment and furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are
amortized using the straight-line method based upon the shorter of the estimated
useful lives all of which are currently five years or the remaining lease
term.
Revenue recognition
The Company recognizes revenue upon shipment of product to customers
provided no significant obligations remain and collectibility is probable.
Certain distributors have sales agreements allowing limited rights to return
product without penalties. In such cases the Company recognizes revenue upon
sales of the product by the distributor to its customers.
Software development costs
Software  development costs incurred prior to the establishment of
technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. Software development costs
incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility will be
capitalized, if material. To date, all software development costs incurred
subsequent to the  establishment of technological  feasibility have been
immaterial, and therefore no software development costs have been capitalized.
Warranty expense
Upon product shipment, the Company provides for the estimated cost that
may be incurred under its various product warranties.
Net income per share
The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 128,
Earnings per Share, SFAS 128in the first quarter of fiscal 1998. SFAS 128
requires presentation of both Basic EPS and Diluted EPS on the face of the
statement of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income loss
available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive
potential common shares outstanding during a period. In computing Diluted EPS,
the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of
shares assumed to be purchased under the treasury stock method from exercise of
stock options.
Foreign currency transactions
The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of Premisys Asia, Premisys
Canada and Premisys  Europe.  Exchange gains and losses  resulting from
transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are included in
net income. To date, the resulting gains and losses have not been material.
Fiscal year
The Company uses a 52/53 week accounting year that ends on the Friday
closest to June 30. For purposes of financial statement presentation, each
fiscal year is considered to have ended on June 30.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements
In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income,  SFAS  130.  SFAS 130  establishes  standards for reporting
comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose
financial  statements.  SFAS 130 requires that items to be recorded in
comprehensive income, which include unrealized gains/losses on marketable
securities  classified as  available-for-sale  and cumulative  translation
adjustments, be displayed with the same prominence as other financial statement
items. SFAS 130 is required to be adopted in the Company financial statements
for the year ending June 30, 1999.
In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, SFAS 131. SFAS 131
establishes standards for the way public business enterprises report information
about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires those
enterprises to report selected information about operating segments in interim
financial reports issued to shareholders. SFAS 131 also establishes standards
for related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major
customers. SFAS 131 is required to be adopted in the Company financial
statements for the year ending June 30, 1999.
In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, SFAS 133. This statement
provides  guidance on accounting for derivative  instruments and hedging
activities. SFAS 133 requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either
assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value. It also
provides guidance for accounting changes in the fair value of a derivative
i.e., gains and losses. SFAS 133 is effective for all quarters of fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 1999. NOTE 2 - BALANCE SHEET COMPONENTS

NOTE 3 - ACQUIRED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN-PROCESS
In the quarter ended March 31, 1997, the Company executed a technology
license agreement with Positron. The Company licensed certain SONET and SDH
based technologies for use in its future products, including the Q-155, which
was announced in June 1997. The licensed technology includes the right to modify
and manufacture products which are based on Positron OSIRIS-155Mb/s SONET/SDH
products. The licensed technology also includes the right to use and manufacture
Positron proprietary application-specific integrated circuits ASICs, and
training and integration assistance on all design materials.
The Company will pay Positron $4 million of license fees over three years.
Positron will also be paid a royalty on the Company products utilizing the
licensed technology up to a maximum of $4 million. Thus, total payments to
Positron will be between $4 million and $8 million. The Company expensed the $4
million of license fees as acquired research and development in process in the

interfaces to OC-3 and OC-12, 10/100MB Ethernet/Fast Ethernet interfaces, and
related software. The Company will use these technologies to develop broadband
ATM and IP multiservice platforms.
The Company is paying a total of $44 million for licensing SNT
technologies and related software. The Company expensed these fees as acquired
research and development in-process in the March 31, 1998 quarter. The Company
also received options to license future releases of SNT software for additional
fees. NOTE 4 - INCOME TAXES

NOTE 6 - STOCK BENEFIT PLANS
Stock option plans
In March 1992, the Company adopted a Stock Option Plan the 1992 Option
Plan. The 1992 Option Plan provides for the granting of incentive stock
options and nonqualified stock options to employees at prices not less than the
fair market value and not less than 85% of the fair market value of the
Company Common Stock, respectively, on the date of grant. While previously
issued options remain outstanding under the 1992 Option Plan, the Company can no
longer issue new options out of the 1992 Option Plan.
On November 16, 1994, the Company Board of Directors approved the 1994
Stock Option Plan the 1994 Option Plan. Under the terms of the 1994 Option
Plan, 5,200,000 shares of the Company Common Stock are reserved for issuance
at exercise prices not less than the fair value of the Company Common Stock at
the date of grant. The incentive and nonqualified stock options have ten-year
terms, and vest over a period determined by the Board of Directors, but not to
exceed five years. Options granted to date have vesting terms of four years. The
1994 Option Plan will terminate ten years after its adoption unless terminated
earlier by the Board of Directors.
In February 1995, the Company Board of Directors adopted, and the
Company  stockholders  approved,  the 1995 Directors Stock Option Plan
Directors Plan, which provides for the automatic grant of options to
purchase shares of Common Stock to non-employee directors of the Company
Eligible Directors. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be
issued pursuant to options granted under the Directors Plan is 240,000. Pursuant
to the terms of the Directors Plan, each Eligible Director who becomes a member
of the Board and who has not otherwise received options in connection with his
Board service will automatically be granted an option to purchase 24,000 shares
of Common Stock on the date the Eligible Director first joins the board. Each
Eligible Director will automatically be granted an additional option for 6,000
shares of Common Stock annually. Each Grant will vest as to 25% of the shares
per year thereafter, so long as the non-employee director remains a member of
the Board. Options granted under the Directors Plan expire ten years from the
date of grant. The exercise price of options under the Directors Plan must be
equal to the fair market value of the Company Common Stock on the date of
grant. The Directors Plan will terminate in February 2005, unless sooner
terminated by the Board.
On March 19, 1997 the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
approved offering employees the right to amend outstanding stock options granted
under the Company 1994 Stock Option Plan. The amended stock options have an
exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company Common Stock on April
23, 1997 and a new vesting schedule beginning on the same date with a duration
equal to that of the original option. Corporate officers were excluded from this
option repricing offer. Employees elected to amend options for approximately
1,051,000 shares; the new exercise price was $81875 per share. In the summary
table below, these options are included in shares granted and shares canceled in
fiscal 1997.
As of June 30, 1998, of the 4,653,215 shares subject to outstanding
options, 1,298,957 shares of such Options were exercisable; and options to
purchase 776,639 shares of the Company Common Stock were available for future
grant under all of the Company option plans. A summary of transactions relating to all of the Company option plans is as

Stock Purchase Plan
In February 1995, the Company Board of Directors approved the 1995
Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Stock Purchase Plan. Under the terms of the
Stock Purchase Plan, all employees of the Company may contribute, through
payroll deductions, up to 10% of their annual compensation toward the purchase
of the Company Common Stock. The Company has reserved 400,000 shares for
issuance under the Stock Purchase Plan. The purchase price per share is 85% of
the lesser of a the fair market value of the Common Stock on the first day of
the offering period, as defined, or b the fair market value of the Common
Stock on the last day of the offering period, as defined. The Stock Purchase
Plan will terminate ten years after its adoption unless terminated earlier by
the Board of Directors. Pro forma net income and earnings per share
The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, APB 25 in accounting for its
employee stock options because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value
accounting provided for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation, SFAS 123 requires the use of
option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee
stock options. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of the Company
employee stock options has in all cases equaled the market price of the
underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized in
the Company financial statements for employee stock options.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by SFAS 123. This information is required to be determined as if the
Company had accounted for its employee stock options, including shares issued
under the Stock Purchase Plan collectively the options granted subsequent to
June 30, 1995, under the fair value method of that statement. The fair value of
options granted in fiscal 1997 and 1998 reported below have been estimated at
the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes
option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of
publicly traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because
the Company options have characteristics significantly different from those of
publicly traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions
can materially affect the fair value estimates, in the opinion of management,
the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the
fair value of its options.
Had stock-based compensation cost for the options been determined based on
the fair value at the grant dates using the Black-Scholes model as prescribed by
SFAS 123, the Company Results of Operations for the years ended June 30, 1996,
1997 and 1998 would have been as follows                         Year Ended June 30,

The pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share for fiscal 1996,

compensation expense related to grants made prior to fiscal 1996.    The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant

The weighted average estimated grant date fair value, as defined by SFAS

1998 was $1537, $751 and $1118 per share, respectively. The weighted average
estimated grant date fair value, as defined by SFAS 123, for purchase rights
granted under the Stock Purchase Plan during fiscal 1996, 1997 and 1998 was
$545, $746 and $575 per share, respectively.
401k Plan
During fiscal 1994, the Company adopted a 401k plan for its employees
whereby eligible employees may contribute up to 20% of their earnings, on a
pre-tax basis, subject to the maximum amount permitted by the Internal Revenue
Code. Under the 401k plan, the Company may make contributions at the
discretion of the Board of Directors. During fiscal 1996, the Company matched
employee contributions up to $800 per contributor per plan year and reduced the
maximum contribution to 15% of earnings. The Company continued the $800 per
contributor per plan year match and the 15% maximum contribution in fiscal 1997
and 1998. NOTE 7 - INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
