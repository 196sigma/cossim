To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Ciena Corporation In our opinion, the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Ciena Corporation and its subsidiaries at October 31, 2004 and
October 31, 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31,
2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP McLean, VA

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1CIENA CORPORATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Description of Business Ciena Corporation supplies application-focused communications networking
equipment, software and services to communications service providers, cable
operators, governments and enterprises. Ciena is a network specialist, focused
on optimizing access and edge networks for broadband communication, enhancing
enterprise data services and evolving network infrastructure to support new
services through automation and convergence. Ciena was incorporated in Delaware in November1992, and completed its
initial public offering on February7, 1997. Cienas principal executive
offices are located at 1201 Winterson Road, Linthicum, Maryland 21090. Principles of Consolidation Ciena has 19 wholly owned U.S. and international subsidiaries, which have
been consolidated in the accompanying financial statements. On May3, 2004,
Ciena acquired by merger Catena Networks Inc. Catena, a Delaware company
based in Ottawa, Ontario, and Internet Photonics, Inc., Internet Photonics,
a Delaware company based in Shrewsbury, New Jersey. On August29, 2003, Ciena
acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Akara Corporation Akara, a
Delaware company based in Ottawa, Ontario. On June16, 2003, Ciena acquired by
merger WaveSmith Networks, Inc. WaveSmith, a Delaware company based in
Acton, Massachusetts. On June21, 2002, Ciena acquired by merger ONI Systems
Corp. ONI, a Delaware Company which was headquartered in San Jose,
California. The Catena, Internet Photonics, Akara, WaveSmith and ONI
transactions were all accomplished as tax-free reorganizations, all of which
were recorded using the purchase accounting method. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Ciena and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material inter-company accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Fiscal Year Ciena has a 52 or 53week fiscal year, which ends on the Saturday nearest
to the last day of October in each year October30, 2004, November1, 2003,
and November2, 2002. For purposes of financial statement presentation, each
fiscal year is described as having ended on October31. Fiscal 2004, fiscal
2003 and fiscal 2002 were comprised of 52weeks. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires Ciena to make estimates, judgments and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue
and expenses, together with amounts disclosed in the related notes to the
financial statements. Actual results could differ from the recorded estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents Ciena considers all highly liquid investments purchased with expected
original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Investments Cienas short-term and long-term investments are classified as
available-for-sale and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Realized gains or losses and declines in value determined to be other than
temporary, if any, on available-for-sale securities, are reported in other
income or expense as incurred. Ciena also has certain other minority equity investments in privately held
technology companies. These investments are generally carried at cost as Ciena
owns less than 20% of the voting equity and does not have the ability to
exercise significant influence over these companies. As of October31, 2003 and
October31, 2004, $213million and $216million of 49 these investments are included in other long-term assets, respectively. These
investments are inherently high risk as the market for technologies or product
manufactured by these companies are usually early stage at the time of the
investment by Ciena and such markets may never be significant. Ciena could lose
its entire investment in some or all of these companies. Ciena monitors these
investments for impairment and makes appropriate reductions in carrying values
when necessary. During fiscal 2002, fiscal 2003, and fiscal 2004, Ciena
recorded a charge of $166million, $48million and $41million,
respectively, from a decline in the fair values of certain equity investments
that were determined to be other than temporary. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost
determined on the first-in, first-out basis. Ciena records a provision for
excess and obsolete inventory whenever such an impairment has been identified. Equipment, Furniture and Fixtures Equipment, furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost. Depreciation and
amortization are computed using the straight-line method over useful lives of 2
to 5years for equipment, furniture and fixtures and 9 to 10years for
leasehold improvements. Impairments of equipment, furniture and fixtures are
determined in accordance with Statement Financial Accounting Standards No144
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144.
This statement is effective for fiscal 2003 and supersedes Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of SFAS 121. Internal use software and web site development costs are capitalized in
accordance with Statement of Position SOPNo98-1, Accounting for the Costs
of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, and Emerging
Issues Task Force EITF Issue No00-02, Accounting for Web Site
Development Costs. Qualifying costs incurred during the application
development stage, which consist primarily of outside services and purchased
software license costs, are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful
life of the asset. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Ciena has recorded goodwill and purchased intangible assets as a result of
several acquisitions. See Note 2. Ciena accounts for goodwill in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142 Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets SFAS 142, which requires Ciena to test each reporting
units goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, which Ciena has determined
to be the last business day of September each year, and between annual tests if
events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce
the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. See Note 4.
Purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization.
Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the economic lives
of the respective assets, generally three to seven years. It is Cienas policy
to assess periodically the carrying amount of its purchased intangible assets
to determine if there has been an impairment to their carrying value.
Impairments of other intangibles assets are determined in accordance SFAS 144. Concentrations Substantially all of Cienas cash and cash equivalents, short-term and
long-term investments, are custodied at three major U.S. financial
institutions. The majority of Cienas cash equivalents consist of money market
funds and overnight repurchase agreements. Deposits held with banks may exceed
the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally these deposits may
be redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk. Historically, Ciena has relied on a limited number of customers for a
substantial portion of our revenue. During fiscal 2004 only SAIC accounted for
at least 10% of Cienas revenue. During fiscal 2003 Qwest and ATT each
accounted for at least 10% of Cienas revenue. During fiscal 2002, Sprint and
ATT each accounted for at least 10% of Cienas revenue. Ciena expects that a
significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be generated by a
limited number of customers. The loss of any one of these customers or any
substantial reduction in orders by any one of these customers could materially
adversely affect Cienas financial condition or operating results. See Note 17. Additionally, Cienas access to certain raw materials is dependent upon
single and sole source suppliers. The inability of any supplier to fulfill
supply requirements of Ciena could affect future results. Ciena relies on a
small number of contract manufacturers to perform the majority of the
manufacturing operations for its products. If Ciena cannot effectively manage
these manufacturers and forecast future demand, or of they fail to deliver
products or components on time, Cienas business may suffer. 50 Revenue Recognition Ciena recognizes revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
104, Revenue Recognition SAB 104, which states that revenue is realized
or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered; the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable; and collectibility
is reasonably assured. For transactions involving the sale of software, revenue
is recognized in accordance with Statement of Position No97-02 SOP 97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, including deferral of revenue recognition in
instances where vendor specific evidence for undelivered elements is not
determinable. For arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of
multiple products, services and or rights to use assets, the determination as
to how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the
separate deliverables of the arrangement is determined in accordance with the
EITF Issue No00-21, Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Revenue Related Accruals Ciena provides for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty and
other contractual obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue. Such
reserves are determined based upon actual warranty cost experience, estimates
of component failure rates, and managements industry experience. Cienas sales
contracts generally do not permit the right of return of product by the
customer after the product has been accepted. Research and Development Ciena charges all research and development costs to expense as incurred. Advertising Costs Ciena expenses all advertising costs as incurred. Income Taxes Ciena accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No109 SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. SFAS
109 is an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their respective tax bases,
and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. In estimating future tax
consequences, SFAS 109 generally considers all expected future events other
than the enactment of changes in tax laws or rates. Valuation allowances are
provided, if based upon the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely
than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Tax
savings resulting from deductions associated with stock options and certain
stock warrants are credited directly to additional paid in capital when
realization of such benefit is fully assured. See Note 14. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of Cienas financial instruments, which include
short-term and long-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
and other accrued expenses, approximate their fair values due to their short
maturities. At October31, 2004, the fair value of the Ciena convertible
subordinated notes was $5969million. The fair value is based on the quoted
market price for the notes. Foreign Currency Translation The majority of Cienas foreign branches and subsidiaries use the U.S.
dollar as their functional currency, as the U.S. parent exclusively funds the
branches and subsidiaries operations with U.S. dollars. For those subsidiaries
using the local currency as their functional currency, assets and liabilities
are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Resulting
translation adjustments are recorded directly to a separate component of
stockholders equity. Where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency,
translation adjustments are recorded in other income. The net gain losson
foreign currency re-measurement and exchange rate changes for fiscal 2002,
fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 was immaterial for separate financial statement
presentation. 51 Computation of Basic Net Income Loss per Common Share and Diluted Net Income
Loss per Common and Dilutive Potential Common Share Ciena calculates earnings per share in accordance with the Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No128, Earnings per Share SFAS 128. SFAS
128 simplifies the earnings per share EPS computation and replaces the
presentation of primary EPS with a presentation of basic EPS. This statement
also requires dual presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face of the
income statement for entities with a complex capital structure and requires a
reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used for the basic and diluted
EPS computations. See Note 12. Software Development Costs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No86, Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed SFAS
86, requires the capitalization of certain software development costs
incurred subsequent to the date technological feasibility is established and
prior to the date the product is generally available for sale. The capitalized
cost is then amortized over the estimated product life. Ciena defines
technological feasibility as being attained at the time a working model is
completed. To date, the period between achieving technological feasibility and
the general availability of such software has been short, and software
development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant.
Accordingly, Ciena has not capitalized any software development costs. Accounting for Stock Options In October1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard No123 SFAS 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS 123 allows companies to account for stock-based
compensation either under the new provisions of SFAS 123 or using the intrinsic
value method provided by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25 APB 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, but requires pro forma disclosure
in the footnotes to the financial statements as if the measurement provisions
of SFAS 123 had been adopted. In December2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure SFAS 148. SFAS 148 amends SFAS 123,
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair
value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In
addition, SFAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require
prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of
the method used on reported results. SFAS 148 is effective for financial
statements for fiscal years ending after December15, 2002. Ciena has elected to continue to account for its stock-based compensation
in accordance with the provisions of APB 25 as interpreted by FASB
Interpretation No44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation, an Interpretation of APB Opinion No25, FIN 44 and present
the pro forma disclosures required by SFAS 123 as amended by SFAS 148. Had compensation cost for Cienas stock option plans and employee stock
purchase plan been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for
awards in fiscal year 2002, fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 consistent with the
provisions of SFAS 123 as amended by SFAS 148, Cienas net loss and net loss
per share for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 would have increased and Cienas net
loss and net loss per share for fiscal 2002 would have decreased to the pro

Segment Reporting In June1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No131 SFAS 131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS 131 establishes annual
and interim reporting standards for operating segments of a company. It also
requires entity-wide disclosures about the products and services an entity
provides, the material countries in which it holds assets and reports revenue,
and its major customers. Ciena reorganized its operations effective as of the second quarter of
fiscal 2004 into multiple operating segments for the purpose of making
operating decisions and assessing performance. Those operating segments were
the following: Core Networking Group CNG; Metro and Enterprise Solutions
Group MESG; Data Networking Group DNG; and Global Network Services GNS.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2004 the Broadband Access Group BBGwas
organized from the operations of Catena, acquired on May3, 2004. During
October2004 in order to improve operational efficiencies, operating decisions
and assess performance, Ciena combined the operations of CNG and MESG and
formed the Transport and Switching Group TSG. See Note 17. Newly Issued Accounting Standards In January2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No46 FIN 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting
Research Bulletin No51. FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities
to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity
investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling
financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to
finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from
other parties. FIN 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities
created or acquired after January31, 2003. For variable interest entities
created or acquired prior to February1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be
applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after December15,
2003. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on Cienas
financial position or results of operations. In May2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
No150 SFAS 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. This Statement establishes
standards for
how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial
position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities
and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is
within its scope as a liability or 53 an asset in some circumstances because
that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer. This Statement
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May31,
2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period
beginning after June15, 2003, except for mandatory redeemable financial
instruments of nonpublic entities. The FASB has defined implementation of SFAS
150 indefinitely for certain non-controlling interests, the provisions of which
are currently not applicable to Ciena. The adoption of this standard did not
have a material impact on Cienas financial position or results of operations. In March2004,
the FASB issued a
proposed statement, Share-Based Payment, which addresses the accounting for
share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee
services in exchange for equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities
that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that
may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. The proposed
statement would eliminate the ability to account for share-based compensation
transactions using Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and generally would require instead
that such transaction be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. In
October2004, the FASB delayed the effective date of the proposed statement
from periods ending after January1, 2005 until periods ending after June30,
2005. Ciena continues to monitor the potential impact of the proposed
statement on its financial condition and results of operations. In March2004, the FASB approved EITFIssue
No03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application
to Certain Investments. The objective of this issue is to provide guidance for
identifying other-than-temporarily impaired investments. EITF No03-1 also
provides new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be
temporarily impaired. In September2004, the FASB issued EITF No03-1-1,
which delayed the effective date of EITF No03-1, with the exception of
certain disclosure requirements. Ciena does not believe that EITF No03-1
will have a material impact on its financial condition and results of
operations. In November2004,
the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No151 SFAS 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No43,
Chapter4. This Statement amends the guidance in ARB No43 Chapter4,
Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material spoilage.
Paragraph5 of ARB 43, Chapter4, previously stated that... under some
circumstances, items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double
freight, and rehandling costs may be so abnormal to require treatment as a
current period charges... This Statement requires that those items be
recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the
criterion of so abnormal. In addition, this Statement requires that
allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on
the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of this
Statement will be effective for inventory costs during the fiscal years
beginning after June15, 2005. Ciena does not believe that the adoption of
this Statement will have a material impact on its financial condition or
results of operations. Reclassification Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current
year consolidated financial statement presentation. 2BUSINESS COMBINATIONS In fiscal 2004, Ciena acquired Catena and Internet Photonics. In fiscal
2003, Ciena acquired Akara and WaveSmith. In fiscal 2002, Ciena acquired ONI.
As a result of these acquisitions, Ciena has recorded charges for in-process
research and development and recorded intangible assets related to existing
technology. In-process research and development represents in-process technology that,
as of the date of the acquisition, has not reached technological feasibility
and has no alternative future use. Based on valuation assessments, the value of
these projects is determined by estimating the resulting net cash flows from
the sale of the products resulting from the completion of the projects, reduced
by the portion of the revenue attributable to developed technology and the
percentage of completion of the project. The resulting cash flows are then
discounted back to their present values at appropriate discount rates. Existing technology represents purchased technology for which development
had been completed as of the date of acquisition. This amount is determined
using the income approach. This method consisted of estimating future net cash
flows attributable to existing technology for a discrete projection period and
discounting the net cash flows to their present value. The existing technology
will be amortized over its useful life. 54 The purchase price for Cienas acquisitions have been based on the average
closing price of Cienas common stock for two trading days prior to, the date
of, and the two trading days after the announcement of the acquisition. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price at the date

Catena Catena was a privately held corporation headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario.
Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement, Catena merged into Ciena,
and the outstanding shares of Catena common and preferred stock were exchanged
for approximately 67,773,442 shares of Ciena common stock. The aggregate
purchase price was $4661million, which included Ciena common stock valued at
$4072million, Ciena options, warrants and restricted stock valued at $537
million, and transaction costs of $52million. The $730million assigned to existing technology will be amortized over
periods ranging from 45 to 65years. The $180million assigned to the
contracts, customer relationships and purchase orders will be amortized over
periods ranging from 3months to 45years. The goodwill allocated to the purchase price was $3262million and is not
deductible for tax purposes. The operations of
Catena were incorporated into Cienas BBG operating segment, and
accordingly the goodwill from this transaction has been assigned to this
operating segment. The following unaudited pro forma data summarizes the results of
operations for the period indicated as if the Catena acquisition had been
completed as of the beginning of the periods presented. The unaudited pro forma
data gives effect to the combined actual operating results prior to the May3,
2004 acquisition, adjusted to include the pro forma effect of amortization of
intangibles and deferred stock compensation costs. These pro forma amounts do
not purport to be indicative of the results that would have actually been
obtained if the acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the periods
presented or that may be obtained in the future in thousands, except per share
data. 55

Internet Photonics Internet Photonics was a privately held corporation headquartered in
Shrewsbury, New Jersey. Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement,
Internet Photonics merged into Ciena, and the outstanding shares of Internet
Photonics common and preferred stock were exchanged for approximately
22,623,313 shares of Ciena common stock. The aggregate purchase price was
$1492million, which included Ciena common stock valued at $1394million,
Ciena options, and restricted stock valued at $61million, and transaction
costs of $37million. The $100million assigned to existing technology will be amortized over
65years. The $22million assigned to non-compete agreements will be
amortized over 12months. The $211million assigned to the contracts, customer
relationships and purchase orders will be amortized over periods ranging from 3
months to 65years. The $94million assigned to the value of the loan was
based upon the present value of the loan at the time of the acquisition. The
loan was payable to Ciena and was eliminated during the allocation of the
purchase price. The goodwill allocated to the purchase price was $1206million and is not
deductible for tax purposes. The operations of Internet Photonics were
incorporated into Cienas TSG operating segment, and accordingly the goodwill
from this transaction has been assigned to this operating segment. The
operations of Internet Photonics are not material to the consolidated financial
statements of Ciena, and accordingly, separate pro forma financial information
has not been presented. Akara On August29, 2003, Ciena completed the acquisition by merger of Akara, a
privately held corporation headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario. Pursuant to the
terms of the acquisition agreement, Akara became a wholly owned subsidiary of
Ciena, and the outstanding shares of Akara common and preferred stock were
exchanged for $306million in cash and approximately 2,343,015 shares of Ciena
common stock. The aggregate purchase price was $447million, which included
Ciena common stock valued at $138million, and transaction costs of $03
million. The $21million assigned to the contracts and purchase orders will be
amortized over five years. The $61million assigned to the value of the
promissory notes and loans was based upon the present value of the notes at the
time of the acquisition. Ciena paid $31million of these obligations in full
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, and the remaining $30million
payable to Ciena was eliminated during the consolidation. The amount of goodwill allocated to the purchase price was $343million
and is not deductible for tax purposes. At the time of the acquisition Ciena
operated as one operating segment and reported only certain enterprise-wide
disclosures. Accordingly, the goodwill from this transaction was not part of a
separate reportable segment. The operations of Akara were
not material to the consolidated financial statements of Ciena and,
accordingly, separate pro forma financial information has not been presented. WaveSmith On June16, 2003, Ciena completed the acquisition by merger of WaveSmith,
a privately held corporation headquartered in Acton, Massachusetts. Pursuant to
the terms of the acquisition agreement, WaveSmith merged into Ciena, and the
outstanding shares of WaveSmith common and preferred stock were exchanged for
approximately 33,421,217 shares of Ciena common stock. The aggregate purchase
price was $1568million, which included Ciena common stock valued at $1427
million, Ciena options, warrants and restricted stock valued at $79million,
transaction costs of $12million and an initial Ciena investment of $50
million. The $54million assigned to the contracts and purchase orders will be
amortized over a range of two months to five years. 56 The amount of goodwill allocated to the purchase price was $893million
and is not deductible for tax purposes. At the time of the acquisition Ciena
operated as one operating segment and reported only certain enterprise-wide
disclosures. Accordingly, the goodwill from this transaction was not part of a
separate reportable segment. The operation of WaveSmith was not material to the
consolidated financial statements of Ciena and, accordingly, separate pro forma
financial information has not been presented. ONI On June21, 2002, Ciena completed the acquisition by merger of
ONI headquartered in San Jose, California. Under the
terms of the agreement, each outstanding share of capital stock of ONI was
exchanged for 07104 shares of Ciena common stock, and Ciena assumed all ONI
outstanding options and warrants as well as the ONI outstanding convertible
debt. The stockholders of ONI received 101,120,724 shares of Ciena common stock
of which 1,039,429 shares were restricted and subject to repurchase at the time
of the acquisition. Additionally, Ciena converted options and warrants to purchase
approximately 18,193,345 ONI shares into options and warrants to purchase
12,924,552 shares of Ciena common stock. The aggregate purchase price was
$9782million, including Ciena common stock valued at $8757million, Ciena
options, warrants and restricted stock valued at $892million and transaction
costs of $133million. The $21million assigned to the other intangible assets, non-compete
agreements and contracts, was amortized over a range of two months to one year. During the quarter ended July31, 2002, Ciena and ONI reduced their
combined workforce by approximately 283 employees. Approximately $38million
of costs associated with the ONI workforce reduction qualify for treatment
under EITF 95-3 Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase
Combination and were recorded as an element of the acquisition. The $802million assigned to the value of the unfavorable lease
commitments was based upon the present value of the assumed lease obligations
based upon current rental rates at the time of the acquisition. These
unfavorable lease commitments will be paid over the respective lease terms
through fiscal 2011. The $2180million assigned to the value of the ONI $3000
million principal amount of 50% convertible subordinated notes due October15,
2005 was based upon the present value of the notes at the time of the
acquisition. Ciena accreted the difference between the present value of the
notes and the outstanding principal value over the remaining period to October
15, 2005, such that the carrying value of the notes would equal the principal
value at the time the notes become due. Ciena has subsequently repurchased
these notes. See Note 11. The amount of goodwill allocated to the purchase price was $5909million
and is not deductible for tax purposes. At the time of the acquisition Ciena
operated as one operating segment and reported only certain enterprise-wide
disclosures. Accordingly, the goodwill from this transaction was not part of a
separate reportable segment. The following unaudited pro forma data summarizes the results of
operations for the period indicated as if the ONI acquisition had been
completed as of the beginning of the periods presented. The unaudited pro forma
data gives effect to actual operating results prior to the June21, 2002
acquisition, adjusted to include the pro forma effect of amortization of
intangibles, deferred stock compensation costs, and the tax effects to the pro

not purport to be indicative of the results that would have actually been
obtained if the acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the periods
presented or that may be obtained in the future in thousands, except per share
data.

57 3RESTRUCTURING COSTS
Ciena has previously taken actions to align its workforce, facilities and
operating costs with business operations. Prior to the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No146 SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, for transactions initiated after
December31, 2002, Ciena followed the guidance of EITF 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring, for restructuring charges. However, given
the manner in which Ciena undertook such restructuring activities, there have
been no significant differences in financial reporting. Ciena historically has
committed to a plan and incurred the liability concurrently meeting the
criteria of both EITF 94-3 and SFAS 146 consistently. The following table
displays the activity and balances of the restructuring reserve account for the
years ended October31, 2003 and October31, 2004 in thousands

During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, Ciena recorded a
restructuring charge of $24million associated with the workforce
reduction of approximately 75 employees.     
During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, Ciena recorded a restructuring
charge of $22million associated with a workforce reduction of
approximately 84 employees, lease terminations and non-cancelable lease
costs.     
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, Ciena recorded a restructuring
charge of $90million associated with a workforce reduction of
approximately 231 employees, lease terminations and non-cancelable lease
costs.     b
During fiscal 2003, Ciena and WaveSmith reduced their combined
workforce by 8 employees. Approximately $04million of cost associated
with the WaveSmith workforce reduction qualify for treatment under EITF
95-3 Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase
Combination and were recorded as an element of the acquisition.     c
During the first quarter of fiscal 2004, Ciena recorded a
restructuring charge of $13million related to the exit of a warehouse 14million related to work force reductions of approximately 52
employees and $07million related to an adjustment to previous
estimates.     
During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, Ciena recorded a restructuring
charge of $25million related to a workforce reduction of approximately
68 employees and $26million primarily related to an adjustment in
estimated sub leasing income and operating expenses of previously
restructured facilities.     
During the third quarter of fiscal 2004, Ciena recorded a restructuring
charge of $125million related to a workforce reduction of approximately
321 employees, $07million related to exit activities of Cienas San
Jose, CA facility and an adjustment of $03million related to an estimate
of previously restructured facilities.     
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, Ciena recorded a restructuring
charge of $54million related to a workforce reduction of approximately
119 employees, $258million primarily related to the exiting of Cienas
San Jose, CA facility and $38million primarily related to an adjustment
in estimate of operating expenses of previously restructured facilities. 4GOODWILL AND LONG LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS Goodwill Impairment Effective November1, 2001, Ciena adopted SFAS 142 and ceased to amortize
goodwill. On adoption of SFAS 142, Ciena determined that its operations
represented a single reporting unit. Ciena completed an impairment review of
the goodwill associated with its reporting unit during the three months ended
January31, 2002. Ciena compared the fair value of its reporting unit at
November1, 2001 to the carrying value including goodwill for the unit at
November1, 2001, and determined that the carrying value, including goodwill,
did not exceed the units fair value. As a result, no impairment charge was
required on adoption. 58 Prior to the reorganization of Ciena into operating segments during fiscal
2004, the fair value of Cienas goodwill was tested for impairment on an annual
basis, and between annual tests if an event occurred or circumstances changed
that would, more likely than not, have reduced the fair value of Ciena on an
enterprise level, rather than a segment level, below its carrying value. Due to
Cienas reorganization into operating segments, SFAS 142 requires that Ciena
assign goodwill to its reporting units. Ciena has determined its operating
segments and reporting units are the same. In accordance with SFAS 142 Ciena
tests each reporting units goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, which
Ciena has determined to be the last business day of September each year, and
between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would, more
likely than not, reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying
value. The following table summarizes the changes and reorganization assignment
in the carrying amount of Cienas goodwill to its reporting units as of October
31, 2004 for fiscal 2002, fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 in thousands

CNG and MESG were combined to form TSG during October fiscal 2004 During fiscal 2004 Ciena performed its annual testing to determine and
measure goodwill impairment on a reporting unit basis, and with the assistance
from independent valuation experts management performed an assessment of the
fair value of Cienas reporting units and their intangible assets as of
September27, 2004. Ciena compared the fair value of each of its reporting
units to each reporting units carrying value including goodwill and determined
that the carrying value, including goodwill, of CNG, MESG, and BBG exceeded
their respective fair values as of September27, 2004. As a result, Ciena
assessed the fair values of CNG, MESG, and BBG assets, including identified
intangible assets, and liabilities and derived an implied fair value for the
reporting units goodwill. Since the carrying amount of the goodwill assigned
to CNG, MESG and BBG was greater than the implied fair values, an impairment
loss of $933million, $1290million and $1494million for CNG, MESG, and
BBG, respectively, was recognized in fiscal 2004. The fair value of Cienas reporting units were determined using the
average of the outcomes from the following valuation methods: market multiples;
comparable transactions; and discounted cash flows. A control premium of 15% to
20% was added to the valuation results for each reporting unit. Ciena
determined the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets of its
reporting units using discounted cash flows. The cash flow periods used ranged
from one to seven years, applying annual growth rates of 5% to 118%. Ciena used
discount rates of 10% to 30% based of the specific risks and circumstances
associated with the identified intangible asset or other non-goodwill assets or
liability being evaluated. The assumptions supporting the estimated cash flows
for identified intangible assets and other non-goodwill assets and liabilities,
including the discount rate, reflects managements estimates. The discount rate
was based upon Cienas weighted average cost of capital as adjusted for the
risks associated with its operations. During fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003, Ciena, with the assistance from
independent valuation experts, performed an assessment of the fair value of
Cienas single reporting unit and its intangible assets as of September27,
2002 and September26, 2003, respectively. Ciena compared its fair value to its
carrying value including goodwill and determined that its carrying value,
including goodwill, exceeded fair value as of September27, 2002 but did not
exceed fair value as of September26, 2003. As a result, during fiscal 2002
Ciena assessed the fair value of its assets, including identified intangible
assets, and liabilities and derived an implied fair value for its goodwill.
Since the carrying amount of goodwill was greater than its implied fair value,
an impairment loss of $5573million was recognized in fiscal 2002. 59 During fiscal 2002 fair value of Ciena was determined using the average
market price of Cienas common stock over a 10-day period before and after
September27, 2002 and a control premium of 25%. During fiscal 2003 the fair
value of Ciena was determined using the average market price of Cienas common
stock over a 10-day period before and after September26, 2003 and a control
premium of 25%. Ciena determined the estimated fair value of identified
intangible assets and non-goodwill intangible assets and liabilities using
discounted cash flows. The cash flow periods used were eight years, applying
annual growth rates of 10% to 86%. Ciena used discount rates of 10% to 32%
based of the specific risks and circumstances associated with the identified
intangible asset or other non-goodwill assets or liability being evaluated. The
assumptions supporting the estimated cash flows for identified intangible
assets and other non-goodwill assets and liabilities, including the discount
rate, reflects managements estimates. The discount rate was based upon Cienas
weighted average cost of capital as adjusted for the risks associated with its
operations. Long-Lived
Asset Impairment Equipment, Furniture and Fixtures During fiscal 2002, fiscal 2003, and fiscal 2004, Ciena recorded
impairment losses of $1273million, $176million and $159million,
respectively, related to excess equipment, furniture and fixtures that were
classified as held for sale as a result of Cienas restructuring activities. Long-Lived Asset Impairment Other Intangible Assets As part of Cienas review of financial results for fiscal 2002, fiscal
2003 and fiscal 2004, Ciena performed an assessment of the carrying value of
Cienas other intangible assets. The assessment was performed pursuant to SFAS
144 in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 and pursuant to SFAS 121 in fiscal 2002. No
impairments were required in fiscal 2002 or fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2003
Ciena recorded a charge of $296million, related to the impairment of acquired
MetroDirector K2 developed technology. The method used for determining fair
value was the held for use model, two step method. This charge was based on the
amount by which the carrying amount of the developed technology exceeded its
fair value. Fair value was determined
based on discounted future cash flows derived from the developed
technology, which had separately identifiable cash flows. The cash flow periods
used were five years, applying a first year growth rate of 5% with subsequent
declines of between 10% and 20% in the following years. The discount rate used
was 210%. The assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows,
including the discount rate reflect managements best estimates. The discount
rate was based upon Cienas weighted average cost of capital as adjusted for
the risks associated with its operations. 60 5MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES Cash, short-term and long-term investments are comprised of the following

6ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE As of October31, 2003, the trade accounts receivable, net of allowance
for doubtful accounts, included three customers that each accounted for 236 125%, and 101% of the net trade accounts receivable, respectively. As of
October31, 2004, the trade accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful
accounts, included three customers that each accounted for 240%, 123%, and
112% of the net trade accounts receivable, respectively. Ciena performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally
has not required collateral or other forms of security from its customers.
Ciena maintains an allowance for potential losses on a specific identification
basis. Cienas allowance for doubtful accounts as of October31, 2003 and
October31, 2004 was $15million and $10million, respectively. Ciena
recorded a provision for doubtful accounts of approximately $148million
during fiscal 2002. This provision relates to the estimated losses of $181
million from three customers, each of whom filed for bankruptcy protection
during fiscal 2002, offset by a payment of $33million of the gross
outstanding accounts receivable balance due from iaxis Limited through Cienas
sales agreement with Dynegy. Ciena did not record any additional provision for
doubtful accounts
during fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2004, Ciena recovered $31million from
a customer, from which payment was previously deemed doubtful due to the
customers financial condition. Ciena also recorded a provision for doubtful
accounts of approximately $03million during fiscal 2004 relating to one
customer. 61 The following table summarizes the activity in Cienas allowance for

Ciena writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or
unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory
and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and
market conditions. As a result of the decline in capital spending by Cienas
customers, and a further decline in forecasted revenue of existing products in
fiscal 2002, Ciena recorded a provision for excess inventory and purchase
commitments of $2865million, which included charges of $2505million for
excess and obsolescence, and $360million for excess inventory purchase
commitments. During fiscal 2003, Ciena recorded a benefit for excess inventory
of $53million, primarily related to the realization of sales from previously
reserved excess inventory. During fiscal 2004, Ciena recorded a provision for
inventory reserves of $42million, primarily related to excess inventory due
to a change in forecasted sales for certain products. The following table summarizes the activity in Cienas reserve for excess

In January2003, Ciena reached a settlement agreement with Nortel. Under
the agreement, Ciena made a one-time payment of $25million to Nortel, and
Nortel granted Ciena a license under the patents in suit and certain related
patents. Ciena accounted for the $250million liability by recording an
expense of $25million in first quarter 2003 related to the settlement of the
litigation, and recording the remaining $225million as an intangible asset
that is being amortized over eight years based upon the expected life of the
patent rights acquired in the settlement. During fiscal 2003, as a result of the WaveSmith acquisition, we recorded
$543million in developed technology and $54million in other intangibles
related to contracts and outstanding purchase orders. As a result of the Akara
acquisition, we recorded $93million in developed technology and $52million
in other intangibles related to noncompete agreements and customer
relationships. During fiscal 2004, as a result of the Internet Photonics and Catena
acquisitions, Ciena recorded $100million and $730million in existing
technology, respectively and $233million from Internet Photonics and $180
million from Catena in other
intangibles related to covenants not to compete, outstanding purchase
orders and contracts. Ciena also acquired miscellaneous patents and licenses
for $100million that are being amortized over a life of four to seven years. As a result of the impairment of intangible assets, we recorded a charge
against gross developed technology of $296million in fiscal 2003. See Note 4. 63 The aggregate amortization expense of other intangible assets was $90
million, $212million, and $347million for fiscal 2002, fiscal 2003 and
fiscal 2004, respectively. Expected future amortization of other intangible

11CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE On February9, 2001, Ciena completed a public offering of 375%
convertible notes, in an aggregate principal amount of $690million, due
February1, 2008. Interest is payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year
beginning August1, 2001. 64 The notes may be converted into shares of Cienas
common stock at any time before their maturity or their prior redemption or
repurchase by Ciena. The conversion rate is 95808 shares per each $1,000
principal amount of notes, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. On
or after the third business day after February1, 2004, Ciena has the option to
redeem all or a portion of the notes that have not been previously converted at
the following redemption prices expressed as percentage of principle amount

On June21, 2002, in connection with its acquisition of ONI, Ciena assumed
the outstanding ONI 50% convertible subordinated notes, in an aggregate
principal amount of $300million, due October15, 2005. Interest was payable on
April15 and October15 of each year. The ONI 50% convertible subordinated
notes were initially recorded at a value of $2180million based upon the fair
value of the outstanding notes at the time of the acquisition. During the fourth quarter fiscal 2002, Ciena purchased on the open market
$971million of the $300million outstanding ONI convertible subordinated
notes. Ciena paid $752million for notes with a cumulative accreted book value
of $725million, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of
$27million. During the first quarter fiscal 2003, Ciena purchased $1547million of
the remaining $2029million outstanding ONI 50% convertible subordinated
notes pursuant to a tender offer. Ciena paid $1403million related to the
tender offer for notes with a cumulative accreted book value of $1197million,
which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $206
million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2004, Ciena purchased the remaining
$482million of the outstanding ONI 50% convertible subordinated notes. Ciena
paid $492million for the notes with a cumulative accreted book value of $410
million, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of $82million. At closing on October31, 2004, the fair value of the Ciena convertible
subordinated notes was $5969million. The fair value is based on the quoted
market price for the notes. 12LOSS PER SHARE CALCULATION Basic EPS is computed using the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed using the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding, stock options and warrants using the treasury stock
method. Approximately 415million, 346million and 488million options and
restricted stock were outstanding during fiscal 2002, fiscal 2003, and fiscal
2004 respectively, but were not included in the computation of EPS as the
effect would be anti-dilutive. 13STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Stockholder Rights Plan In December1997, Cienas Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights
Plan. This plan is designed to deter any potential coercive or unfair takeover
tactics in the event of an unsolicited takeover attempt. It is not intended to
prevent a takeover of Ciena on terms that are favorable and fair to all
shareholders and will not interfere with a merger approved by the Board of
Directors. Each right entitles shareholders to buy a unit equal to one
one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock of Ciena. The rights will be
exercisable only if a person or a group acquires or announces a tender or
exchange offer to acquire 15% or more of Cienas common stock or if Ciena
enters into certain other business combination transactions not approved by the
Board of Directors. In the event the rights become exercisable, the rights plan allows for
Ciena shareholders to acquire stock of the surviving corporation, whether or
not Ciena is the surviving corporation, having a value twice that of the
exercise price of the rights. The rights were distributed to shareholders of
record in January1998. The rights will expire in December2007 and are
redeemable for $0001 per right at the approval of Cienas Board of Directors. 65 14INCOME TAXES Loss before income taxes and the provision for income taxes consists of

During fiscal 2002, Ciena established a valuation allowance against its
deferred tax assets. Ciena intends to maintain a valuation allowance until
sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal. As of October31, 2004, Ciena had a $257billion net operating loss carry
forward and a $768million income tax credit carry forward which begin to
expire in fiscal year 2018 and 2012 respectively. Cienas ability to use net
operating losses and credit carry forwards may be subject to limitations
pursuant to the ownership change rules of the Internal Revenue Code Section
382. 66 The income tax provision does not reflect the tax savings resulting from
deductions associated with Cienas stock. The tax benefit on deductions of
approximately $1021million associated with Cienas stock will be credited to
additional paid-in capital when realized. Approximately $1280million of the valuation allowance as of October31,
2004 was attributable to deferred tax assets associated with the acquisitions
of ONI, WaveSmith, Akara, Catena and IPI that when realized, will first reduce
goodwill, then other non-current intangibles of the acquired companies, and
then income tax expense. The IRS is currently examining Cienas federal income tax returns for
fiscal 1999 through fiscal 2002. Management does not expect the outcome of
these examinations to have a material effect on Cienas consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flow. 15EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Active Equity Incentive Plans Ciena maintains four active equity incentive plans under which it grants
stock options, restricted stock, or other forms of equity-based compensation:
the 1999 Non-Officer Incentive Stock Plan the 1999 Plan; the Third Amended
and Restated 1994 Stock Option Plan the 1994 Plan; the 1996 Outside
Directors Stock Option Plan the 1996 Plan; and the Ciena Corporation 2000
Equity Incentive Plan the 2000 Plan. The 1999 Plan authorizes the issuance of non-qualified options to
employees of Ciena who are not executive officers or directors. The exercise
price for each option is established by the Board of Directors at not less than
85% of fair market value of the Common Stock at the time of grant. Options
issued under the plan vest over four years. As of October31, 2004, there were
57,175,278 shares authorized for issuance. The 1994 Plan authorizes the issuance of either qualified or non-qualified
options to directors, employees or consultants. In general, Ciena uses the 1994
Plan to grant options to executive officers. The exercise price for options
under the plan is established by the Board of Directors at not less than the
fair market value of the Common Stock at the time of grant. The Board
determines the terms of vesting of options issued under the plan. Cienas
current practice is for options to vest over a four-year period. As of October
31, 2004, there were 59,642,297 shares authorized for issuance in the plan. The 1996 Plan provides for the issuance of non-qualified options to
non-employee directors of Ciena. The plan provides automatic grants of ian
initial option at the time of a directors election to the Board and ii
annual options on the day following Cienas annual meeting of shareholders. The
exercise price is equal to the fair market value of the stock at the time of
grant. Initial options vest over three years, and annual options vest after one
year. As of October31, 2004, there were 1,500,000 shares authorized in the
plan. The 2000 Plan was assumed by Ciena as a result of its merger with ONI. It
authorizes the issuance of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock
units and stock bonuses to employees, officers, directors, consultants,
independent contractors and advisors. The terms of awards under the plan are
established by the Board of Directors or its Compensation Committee. The
exercise price of options may not be less than 85% of the fair market value of
the stock at the date of grant 100% of the fair market value for qualified
options. The Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee has broad
discretion to establish the terms and conditions for grants of restricted stock
and stock bonuses. As of October31, 2004, there were 54,676,136 shares
authorized in the plan. Under the terms of the plan, this number will increase
by 50% of the number
of issued and outstanding shares of Ciena each January 1st, unless the
Compensation Committee reduces the amount of the increase in any year. By
action of the Compensation Committee, the amount of the increase on January1,
2004 was only 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of Ciena. In addition,
any shares subject to options or other awards under the ONI 1997 Stock Plan,
ONI 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, or ONI 1999 Equity Incentive Plan that are
forfeited upon cancellation of the option or award are available for grant and
issuance under the 2000 Plan. Other Equity Incentive Plans As a result of its acquisitions of Lightera, Omnia, Cyras, ONI, WaveSmith,
Akara, Catena and Internet Photonics Ciena has assumed obligations under
various equity incentive plans previously maintained by those companies,
including the obligation to honor grants made under these plans prior to the
acquisitions. Ciena will issue Ciena Common Stock upon the exercise of options
outstanding under these plans, and restricted stock issued under these plans
has been converted into restricted shares of Ciena Common Stock. Ciena does not
intend to issue any further grants under these plans. 67 These include the following inactive plans

At October31, 2004, approximately 06million shares of Common Stock
subject to repurchase by Ciena had been issued upon the exercise of options and
restricted stock purchase agreements, and 269million of the total outstanding
options were vested and not subject to repurchase by Ciena upon exercise. As of
October31, 2004, approximately 855million options are available for issuance
under these plans. Of the 636million options outstanding approximately 35million are
performance based options PBOs. These PBOs become exercisable if Ciena
meets specific goals established by Cienas board of directors. Ciena expenses
the cost of each
PBO using the intrinsic value method prescribed by ABP 25 and recognizes
these costs straight-line over the estimated performance period. In addition to the outstanding stock options, as of October31, 2004,
approximately 02million restricted stock units RSUhad been issued from the
2000 Plan. A RSU is a right to receive a share of Corporations Common Stock
when the unit vests or, if the holder elects to defer receipt, at a later date
determined by the holder. Ciena expenses the cost of each RSU using the
intrinsic value method prescribed by ABP 25 and recognizes these costs
straight-line over the vesting period. In May2002, Ciena commenced a registered exchange offer pursuant to which
it offered eligible employees the opportunity to exchange outstanding certain
stock options for new options with an exercise price to be established in
November2002. The stock options included in the offer had an exercise price
greater than $1200 per share and were outstanding under the 1994 Plan, the
1999 Plan or the Cyras Systems, Inc. 1998 Plan the Cyras Plan. New options 68 exchanged for options issued under the 1994 Plan and the 1999 Plan were to be
issued under the 1999 Plan, and the new options exchanged for options tendered
under the Cyras Plan were to be issued under the Cyras Plan. Except for options
issued after October16, 2001, the new options were to be exercisable for one
half the number of shares covered by the old options tendered for exchange.
With respect to options issued after October16, 2001, the new options were to
be exercised for the same number of shares as the old options tendered for
exchange. Eligible employees tendered for exchange in the offer options to
purchase a total of 151million shares. On November19, 2002, Ciena completed
the exchange offer and issued new options for approximately 64million shares
at an exercise price of $453 per share. The following table summarizes information with respect to stock options

Employee Stock Purchase Plan In March1998, the shareholders approved the Corporations 1998 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan 1998 ESPP under which 50million shares of common
stock had been reserved for issuance. Eligible employees were able to purchase
a limited number of shares of Cienas stock at 85% of the market value at
certain plan-defined dates. Approximately 13million and 19million shares of
common stock have been issued for $47million and $100million during fiscal
2002 and fiscal 2003 respectively. In March2003 the 1998 ESPP terminated by
its own terms due to the issuance all remaining shares of Cienas common stock
available for issuance under this plan. In March2003, the shareholders
approved the Corporations 2003 Employee
Stock Purchase plan under which 200million shares of common
stock had been reserved for issuance. Eligible employees may purchase a limited
number of shares of Cienas stock at 85% of the market value at certain
plan-defined dates. Approximately 15million and 27
million shares of common stock have been issued for $62million and $84
million during fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004, respectively. As of October31,
2004 approximately 158million shares are available for issuance under this
plan. Employee 401k Plan Ciena has a 401k defined contribution profit sharing plan. The plan
covers all employees who are not part of an excluded group. Participants may
contribute up to 60% of pre-tax compensation, subject to certain limitations.
The plan includes an employer matching contribution equal to 50% of the first
3% an employee contributes each pay period. Ciena may also make discretionary
annual profit sharing contributions up to the IRS regulated limit. Ciena has
made no profit sharing contributions to date. During fiscal 2002, fiscal 2003,
and fiscal 2004, Ciena made matching contributions of approximately $41
million, $20million and $16million respectively 69 16COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Operating Lease Commitments Ciena has certain minimum obligations under non-cancelable operating
leases expiring on various dates through 2019 for equipment and facilities.

Rental expense for fiscal 2002, fiscal 2003, and fiscal 2004 was
approximately $247million, $166million and $163million, respectively. In
addition Ciena paid approximately $72, $227 and $193million during fiscal
2002, fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004, respectively, related to rent costs for
restructured facilities and unfavorable lease commitments, which was offset
against Cienas restructuring liabilities and unfavorable lease obligations,
respectively. Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers Ciena relies on a small number of contract manufacturers to perform the
majority of the manufacturing operations for its products. In order to reduce
lead times and ensure adequate component supply, Ciena enters into agreements
with these suppliers that allow them to procure inventory for Cienas
forecasted future demands. As of October31, 2004, Ciena has purchase
commitments of $594million. Litigation On October3, 2000, Stanford University and Litton Systems filed a
complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of
California alleging that optical fiber amplifiers incorporated into Cienas
products infringe U.S. Patent No4,859,016 the 016 Patent. The complaint
seeks injunctive relief, royalties and damages. We believe that we have valid
defenses to the lawsuit and intend to defend it vigorously. On October10,
2003, the court stayed the case pending final resolution of matters before the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office the PTO, including a request for and
disposition of a reexamination of the 016 Patent. On October16, 2003 and
November2, 2004, the PTO granted reexaminations of the 016 Patent, thus
resulting in a continuation of the stay of the case. On July19, 2000, Ciena and CIENA Properties, Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary that was merged into Ciena on October29, 2004, filed a complaint in
the United States District Court for the District of Delaware requesting
damages and injunctive relief against Corvis Corporation, which was renamed
Broadwing Corporation Broadwing in October2004. The suit charged Broadwing
with infringing four patents relating to Cienas optical networking
communication systems and technology. A jury trial to determine whether
Broadwing is infringing these patents commenced on February10, 2003. On
February24, 2003, the jury decided that Broadwing was infringing on Cienas
U.S. Patent No5,938,309 the 309 Patent, relating to inverse
multiplexing. The jury decided that Broadwing was not infringing on two other
Ciena patents and was deadlocked with respect to Broadwings infringement on
the fourth patent, U.S. Patent No5,504,609 the 609 Patent, relating to
wave division multiplexing. This trial was immediately followed by a trial on
Broadwings affirmative defenses based on the validity of the 309 Patent and
the U.S. Patent No5,557,439, one of the patents that the jury found was not
infringed by Broadwing. On February28, 2003, the jury in this trial determined
that the patents were valid. In April2003, following a third trial, another
jury decided that Broadwing was infringing Cienas 609 Patent, on which the
previous jury had deadlocked. Based on these favorable verdicts collectively
holding that Broadwing is infringing two valid Ciena patents, Ciena moved for
an injunction to prohibit the sale by Broadwing of the infringing products. On
September9, 2004, the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware entered judgment on the jury verdicts and granted Cienas motion for
an injunction against Broadwing relating to the 309 Patent and denied Cienas
motion for an injunction relating to the 609 Patent. On September17, 2004,
Ciena filed a motion requesting that the Court reconsider its injunction ruling
relating to the 609 Patent and, on the same date, the Court indicated by order
its intent to reconsider the denial of an injunction with respect to the 609
Patent. The parties await the Courts ruling on the 609 Patent injunction
issue. On November15, 2004, the parties completed briefing on motions for
judgment as a matter of law and a new trial filed by both Ciena and Broadwing
with respect to certain aspects of the jury verdicts. On October7, 2004,
Broadwings counsel filed a request for ex parte re-examination of the 309
Patent with the PTO. 70 As a result of our merger with ONI Systems Corp. in June2002, we became a
defendant in a securities class action lawsuit. Beginning in August2001, a
number of substantially identical class action complaints alleging violations
of the federal securities laws were filed in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York. These complaints name ONI, Hugh C.
Martin, ONIs former chairman, president and chief executive officer; Chris A.
Davis, ONIs former executive vice president, chief financial officer and
administrative officer; and certain underwriters of ONIs initial public
offering as defendants. The complaints were consolidated into a single action,
and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on April24, 2002. The amended
complaint alleges, among other things, that the underwriter defendants violated
the securities laws by failing to disclose alleged compensation arrangements
such as undisclosed commissions or stock stabilization practices in the
initial public offerings registration statement and by engaging in
manipulative practices to artificially inflate the price of ONIs common stock
after the initial public offering. The amended complaint also alleges that ONI
and the named former officers violated the securities laws on the basis of an
alleged failure to disclose the underwriters alleged compensation arrangements
and manipulative practices. No specific amount of damages has been claimed.
Similar complaints have been filed against more than 300 other issuers that
have had initial public offerings since 1998, and all of these actions have
been included in a single coordinated proceeding. Mr.Martin and Ms.Davis have
been dismissed from the action without prejudice pursuant to a tolling
agreement. In July2004, following mediated settlement negotiations, the
plaintiffs, the issuer defendants including Ciena, and their insurers entered
into a settlement agreement, whereby the plaintiffs cases against the issuers
are to be dismissed. This settlement is subject to court approval. The settling
parties have moved the court for approval of the settlement, which motion has
been opposed by the underwriter defendants. Ciena and ONI Systems were previously defendants in two separate lawsuits
filed by Nortel Networks in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas and United States District Court for the Northern District of
California. The suits alleged, among other things, infringement of Nortel
patents by ONI and Ciena products. In January2003, Ciena agreed to make a
one-time payment of $25million to Nortel and in exchange Nortel granted Ciena
a license under the patents that were the subject of the lawsuit and certain
related patents. Both lawsuits above were dismissed and Nortel and Ciena agreed
not to sue each other for patent infringement for a two year period that
expires on January17, 2005. During the two year period, Ciena and Nortel
Networks have sought to negotiate an acceptable cross-license arrangement but
no such agreement has been reached. 17SEGMENT REPORTING Ciena reorganized its operations effective as of the second quarter of
fiscal 2004 into multiple operating segments for the purpose of making
operating decisions and assessing performance. Those operating segments were
the following: Core Networking Group CNG; Metro and Enterprise Solutions
Group MESG; Data Networking Group DNG; and Global Network Services GNS.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2004 the Broadband Access Group BBGwas
organized from the
operations of our May3, 2004 acquisition of Catena. During October2004
in order improve operational efficiencies, operating decisions and assess
performance Ciena combined the operations of CNG and MESG and formed the
Transport and Switching Group TSG. Cienas geographic distributions of revenue are the following in
