The Board of Directors
TresCom International, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TresCom
International, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 1996 and
1995 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1996. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of TresCom
International, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 1996 and 1995 and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are
recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and  equipment is recorded at cost.  Depreciation  and
amortization  is provided for  financial  reporting  purposes  using the
straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives    Transmission and communications equipment      3 to 10 years
Furniture, fixtures and other            3 to 7 years
The costs of software and software upgrades purchased for internal use
are capitalized. Significant capital projects are constantly being initiated as
the Company continues to expand its network. Beginning in 1996, a substantial
amount of employee time was required to properly plan, install, test and certify
the equipment associated with these projects. In connection with these projects,
the Company capitalized $1,450 in direct employee costs.
ADVERTISING.
Pursuant to American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA
Statement of Position No. 93-7, Reporting on Advertising Costs, the Company
expenses advertising costs as incurred except for direct-response advertising
costs, which are capitalized and amortized over the expected period of future
benefit. Direct-response advertising programs were implemented during 1996 and
consist of fees paid to various telemarketing entities. The capitalized costs
are amortized over a nine month period beginning in the month revenues
associated with those costs are first generated.
At December 31, 1996, advertising costs totaling $1,390 were recorded as
other current assets. Advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 1996,
1995 and 1994 were $2,047, $1,359 and $469 respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA     OTHER ASSETS
The excess of cost over net assets of businesses acquired represents
the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets
acquired and is amortized on a straight-line basis over 35 years. Customer bases
are recorded based on the estimated value of the customer bases acquired in the
acquisition of businesses and are amortized on a straight-line basis over
periods ranging from two to seven years.
Periodically, the Company assesses the appropriateness of the asset
valuations and the amortization periods based on the present value of the
current and anticipated future cash flows and projected profitability of the
acquired business. During 1994, based on these assessments, the Company recorded
additional expense of $5,446 as recognition of the impairment in value of
customer bases acquired in June and July 1994.
Legal expenses and other direct costs incurred in connection with
obtaining financing agreements are deferred and amortized over the life of the
financing agreements. Such costs amounted to $86 and $533 during the years ended
December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Accumulated amortization of deferred
financing costs was $10 and $391 at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
REVENUES
Revenues from long distance telecommunications services are recognized
when the services are provided.
COST OF SERVICES
Cost of services include payments to local exchange carriers LECs,
interexchange carriers, post, telegraph and telephone organizations PTTs and
telecommunications administrations TAs primarily for access and transport
charges.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS
The Company derives a majority of its operating  revenues from
commercial customers in Florida, New York, St. Thomas and Puerto Rico. Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist principally of accounts receivable. The Company allowance for
doubtful  accounts is based upon  management  estimates and historical
experience. In situations where the Company deems appropriate, prepayment and/or
cash deposits or letters of credit are required for the provision of services.
INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method. Under
the liability method, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the net tax
effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting and the amounts used for income tax
purposes.
PER SHARE DATA
Net loss per share was computed by dividing net loss by the weighted
average number of shares of the Company Common Stock, $0419 par value per
share the Common Stock, outstanding after giving retroactive effect to the
conversion of all of the Company Series A Preferred Stock, $01 par value per

the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C
Preferred Stock were required to exchange their shares for shares of Common
Stock; the number of shares of Common Stock was to be calculated based on the
redemption value of the preferred stock divided by the initial public offering
price less underwriting discounts and commissions. The Company was entitled to
redeem, at its option, Series A Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock in
whole or Series B Preferred Stock in whole or in part at the redemption price.
The outstanding Preferred Stock had a preference value of $100 per share for
purposes of calculating dividends and redemption value.
On February 5, 1996, the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock were amended such that mandatory
redemption was not required. In connection with the IPO, the Series A Preferred
Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock were converted into
4,558,155 shares of Common Stock.
COMMON STOCK
In February 1996, the Company effected a reverse stock split of the Common
Stock at a ratio of approximately 419-to-1. The share and per share amounts in
the financial statements have been adjusted for the reverse stock split.
On February 13, 1996, the Company sold 4,545,455 shares of its Common Stock
at $12 per share in the IPO. The net proceeds of this sale were $486 million.
The net proceeds were used to retire debt and accrued interest of approximately

shares of Preferred Stock was reset to one million shares.
STOCK OPTION PLAN
The Company has a stock option plan under which 936,432 options to purchase
shares of Common Stock may be granted to officers, key employees, consultants
and directors. The plan allows the granting of incentive stock options, which
may not have an exercise price below the greater of par value or the market
value on the date of grant, and non-qualified stock options, which may not have
an exercise price below par value. All options must be exercised no later than
10 years from the date of grant. No option may be granted under the plan after
February 22, 2004.
Options generally vest as to 20% on the first anniversary of the vesting
commencement date or grant date and as to an additional 20% on each anniversary
thereafter. All options expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date,
unless sooner terminated under the terms of the Stock Option Plan. In the event
of certain changes in control, all options become fully vested.                    -31              TRESCOM INTERNATIONAL, INC.

price of $1200 per share and 50,000 options outstanding at an exercise price of
$1763. Non-cash compensation expense was recorded over the vesting period of
the options. Accordingly, $1,264 and $139 of non-cash compensation expense was
recorded in the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
The Company follows the requirements of Accounting Principals Board
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees to account for its
stock option plan and, accordingly, compensation cost is recognized in the
consolidated statements of operations for the stock option plan to the extent
the options are granted at prices below fair market value. The Company adopted
SFAS 123, which requires certain disclosures about stock-based  employee
compensation arrangements. SFAS 123 requires pro forma disclosure of the impact
on net income and earnings per share if the fair value method defined in SFAS
123 had been used. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of
grant using a minimum value option valuation method for options granted prior to
the IPO and a Black-Scholes option valuation model for options granted after the
IPO with the following weighted-average assumptions: a risk-free interest rate
of 61%; a dividend yield of 0%; a volatility factor of the expected market
price of the Common Stock of 729; and an expected life of seven years.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility.  Because the  Company  stock  options have  characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because change in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its stock options.
The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted in 1995
and 1996 is $1050 and $788 per share, respectively. The options granted during
1995 had exercise prices below market value and the options granted during 1996
had exercise prices at or above market value.

carryforwards for tax purposes of $11,421 and $9,259, respectively. These net
operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 1997 through 2011.
8.    RETIREMENT PLAN
The Company maintains the TresCom 401k Savings and Retirement Plan for
all U.S. and Virgin Island subsidiaries and the TresCom 165e Savings and
Retirement Plan for the Puerto Rican subsidiary. Employees age 21 or older are
eligible to participate six months after their date of hire and to elect to
defer a percentage of his/her salary. The Company has the discretion to make
contributions to the TresCom 401k Savings and Retirement Plan and TresCom
165e Saving and Retirement Plan. No Company contributions were made to either
plan during 1995 and 1996.
9.     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is involved in various claims and is subject to possible
actions arising out of the normal course of its business. Although the ultimate
outcome of these claims cannot be ascertained at this time, it is the opinion of
the Company management, based on knowledge of the facts and advice of counsel,
that the resolution of such claims and actions will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company financial condition or results of operations.
The Company has entered into agreements where it either owns portions of or
has the indefeasible right to use transmission cables. These agreements require
the Company to fund portions of the construction, operation, and maintenance
costs. At December 31, 1996, the Company has firm construction commitments under
both agreements of approximately $2,500. Construction costs are capitalized and
depreciated over ten years after the transmission cable becomes operational. The
capitalized costs of transmission cables as of December 31, 1996 was $2,995. The
Company has projected maintenance costs of $225 for undersea cables during 1997. 10.    SETTLEMENTS
In the past, the Company incurred some significant charges as a result of
disputes with carriers. These charges amounted to $2,730, $4,100 and $900 in the
fourth quarter of 1994, the first quarter of 1995 and the second quarter of
1995, respectively. In addition, significant losses resulting from settlements
with customers totaled $2,031 and $4,069 during 1994 and the first quarter of
1995, respectively.

13.    NATURAL DISASTER
On September 16, 1995, Hurricane Marilyn damaged the island of St. Thomas
where the Company has significant operations. The Company Property and
Business Interruption Insurance covered a significant portion of the damages to
equipment and certain losses from operations, respectively. At September 30,
1995, the Company estimated its exposure relating to the hurricane to be $2,500.
Based on visits to the affected area, review of accounts receivable and actual
settlements with customers, management revised its estimate of losses resulting
from the hurricane to $1,717. Accordingly, the net loss for the quarter ended
December 31, 1995 included this change in estimate of $783.                    -36             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS The Shareholder

statements  are the  responsibility  of the  Company  management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS
PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1, 1994 TO FEBRUARY 22, 1994
1.    ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND ORGANIZATION
The consolidated statement of operations includes the accounts of The
St. Thomas and San Juan Telephone Company, Inc. STSJ, incorporated in the
U.S. Virgin Islands and its wholly-owned subsidiary, STSJ Overseas Telephone
Company, Inc. Overseas, incorporated in Puerto Rico in 1990 to serve that
market. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.
STSJ and Overseas provide long distance telephone services to residential
and commercial customers between the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the
United States, and other countries worldwide. It owns and operates a satellite
earth station facility in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands.
On February 22, 1994, TresCom International, Inc., purchased all of the
outstanding common stock of STSJ.
ACQUISITION OF PUERTO RICO TELECOM CORPORATION
Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement dated November 12,
1991, Overseas acquired all rights, title, interest and all assets of Puerto
Rico Telecom Corporation Telecom a wholly-owned subsidiary of Atlantic
Tele-Network, Inc. ATN, for a price of $1,861,000. The purchase price was
allocated among the net assets acquired based on their fair market values. The
excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired is being amortized
over thirty years.
REVENUES
Revenues from long distance telecommunications services are recognized
when the services are provided.
NETWORK COSTS
Network costs primarily include right-of-way payments made to local
exchange carriers for access and transport charges. Network costs are recognized
as the services are used.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS
STSJ derives primarily all of its telecommunications service revenues
from commercial and residential customers in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
Financial instruments which potentially subject STSJ to concentrations of credit
risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivable. STSJ allowance for
doubtful  accounts is based upon  management  estimates and historical
experience. STSJ performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
generally does not require collateral.
2.    INCOME TAXES
STSJ is subject to U.S. Virgin Islands corporate income taxes. Overseas
is subject to Puerto Rico income taxes.
On July 17, 1989, the Industrial Development Commission of the U.S.
Virgin  Islands  granted STSJ a tax  exemption to cover long  distance
telecommunication services in the U.S. Virgin Islands, as indicated below   o 100% exemption from gross receipts taxes
o 100% exemption from real property taxes
o 90% exemption from income taxes 
o 100% exemption from various excise taxes                    -40    THE ST. THOMAS AND SAN JUAN TELEPHONE COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS
PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1, 1994 TO FEBRUARY 22, 1994
These tax benefits are for a ten-year period effective January 1, 1989.
There are various conditions to such grant, including the employment of a
minimum of 6 employees. In addition, at least 80% of all employees of grantee
must be U.S. Virgin Islands residents.
As of February 22, 1994, Overseas had approximately $3,395,000 of Puerto
Rico net operating loss carryforwards that can be used to reduce future taxable
income in Puerto Rico through the year 2000.
3.    OPERATING LEASES
STSJ leases its office and operating facilities under noncancelable
operating lease agreements. Future minimum lease commitments at February 22,
1994 are as follows          $  169,200

NOTES TO STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND CASH FLOWS
ELEVEN MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 1994 1.    ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The principal operations of Total Telecommunications, Inc. TTI
consist of providing  telecommunication services to commercial customers,
primarily in Florida. TTI provides a full range of services, including switched
and dedicated, international, domestic, calling card, and 800 services.
On November 30, 1994, all of TTI outstanding stock was acquired by
TresCom International, Inc.
REVENUES
Revenues from long distance telecommunications services are recognized
when the services are provided.
NETWORK COSTS
Network costs primarily include right-of-way payments made to local
exchange carriers for access and transport charges. Network costs are recognized
as services are used.
INCOME TAXES
TTI has elected S Corporation status under the provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code IRC, which eliminates federal income taxes at the
corporate level. Certain states in which TTI conducts business do not recognize
S Corporation status. Accordingly, state income taxes of approximately $8,000 as
of November 30, 1994 have been included in selling, general and administrative
expenses in the accompanying statement of income. Deferred state income taxes
resulting from differences in net income for financial reporting purposes and
taxable income are not significant.
On November 30, 1994, the outstanding stock was acquired by TresCom
International, Inc., a C Corporation under the provisions of the IRC. Because of
the acquisition, TTI will no longer qualify under the Subchapter S provision of
the IRC. The change in filing election as a result of the acquisition will not
have a material effect on TTI deferred state or federal income taxes.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS
TTI derives primarily all of its telecommunications service revenues
from commercial and residential customers in the State of Florida. Financial
instruments which potentially subject TTI to concentrations of credit risk
consist principally of cash and accounts receivable. TTI allowance for
doubtful  accounts is based upon  management  estimates and historical
experience. TTI performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
generally does not require collateral.
2.    COMMITMENTS
TTI entered into a license agreement the Agreement in November 1992
with Electronic Data Systems Corporation EDS,  which allows for the
nonexclusive and nontransferable use of a licensed program in connection with
the TTI invoice printing and billing system. The Agreement requires monthly
payments for licensing fees of approximately $2,800. TTI also pays a monthly
maintenance service fee based on billable messages multiplied by a rate per
message as defined in the Agreement. The Agreement expires April 30, 1998 and is
cancelable by either party upon written notice.
TTI has noncancelable operating leases for the rental of its office
space in Fort Lauderdale and New York. Rental expense amounted to approximately
$143,000 for the eleven months ended November 30, 1994.
