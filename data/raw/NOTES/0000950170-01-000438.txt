40        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To SportsLine.com, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
SportsLine.com, Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December
31, 2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of SportsLine.com, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES     Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
SportsLine.com and its majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Minority interest in the amount of $59,809 as of December 31, 2000
represents the minority preferred shareholders' proportional share of ownership
in Sports.com.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid temporary cash investments with
original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Marketable Securities
Marketable securities include highly liquid investments with original
maturities in excess of three months but less than one year. Noncurrent
marketable securities are those investments with original maturities in excess

Deferred Advertising and Content Costs
Deferred advertising and content costs relates to unamortized costs of
equity instruments issued under the CBS and AOL agreements discussed in Note 6.
Such costs are capitalized as the equity instruments are issued. These costs are
then charged to operations as depreciation and amortization as the Company
receives advertising and other benefits under the agreements.
Licensing and Consulting Agreements
The cost of license and consulting agreements, which is primarily a
result of issuances of warrants to purchase common stock see Note 7, is being
amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the related agreements
from one to ten years beginning in August 1995, when cbs.sportsline.com first
became commercially available. Such costs totaled approximately $20,169 and
$18,602 for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Accumulated amortization on such amounts was approximately $10,116 and $4,365 at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The current portion of such amounts is
reflected in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the long-term portion
in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amortization
expense under these agreements was approximately $5,689, $3,134 and $1,643 for
the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, and is included
in depreciation and amortization expense in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is carried at historical cost and is being
depreciated and amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the
estimated useful life of the asset or the lease period.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred;
betterments are capitalized. Upon the sale or retirement of assets, the cost and
accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the account and any
gain or loss is recognized.
Goodwill
Goodwill, net consists of the following at December 31                          2000       1999
Goodwill, at cost            $58,654     $44,070
Less: Accumulated amortization      7,104     1,247
Goodwill, net              $51,550     $42,823
The Company assesses goodwill recoverability by analyzing the entity
historical operations, undiscounted future cash flows and the market value of
similar entities. An impairment assessment would be triggered if circumstances
regarding the entity ability to generate cash flows would occur.

Revenue Recognition
Revenue recognition policies for advertising, e-commerce, membership
and premium services, content licensing and barter transactions are set forth
below.
Advertising Revenue
Advertising revenue is derived from the sale of advertising on the
Company Web sites. Advertising revenue is recognized in the period the
advertisement is displayed, provided that no significant Company obligations
remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Company
obligations typically include guarantees of a minimum number of impressions,
or times that an advertisement is viewed by users of the Company Web sites.
Amounts received or billed for which impressions have not yet been delivered are
reflected as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
E-Commerce Revenue
E-commerce revenue is derived from the sales of limited edition
memorabilia, licensed apparel, golf equipment and other sports-related products.
E-commerce revenue is recognized once the product has been shipped and payment
is reasonably assured. In 2000, e-commerce revenue consisted solely of revenue
generated by Sports.com.
Membership and Premium Services Revenue
In January 1999, the Company launched SportsLine Rewards, a program
offered at no charge that offers bonus points to members for viewing pages and
making purchases. These points can be redeemed for discounts on merchandise,
special events and other premium items. For a fee, the Company offers
SportsLine Rewards Plus where members are also eligible to participate in
sports contests to win cash prizes and merchandise. The Rewards Plus program
offers annual memberships, the revenue from which is recognized ratably over the
life of the membership agreement.
Revenue relating to monthly memberships is recognized in the month the
service is provided. Revenue relating to yearly memberships and sports contests
is recognized ratably over the life of the membership agreement or contest
period. Accordingly, amounts received for which services have not yet been
provided are reflected as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets.

Content Licensing Revenue
Content licensing revenue is derived from the licensing of certain of
the Company content to third parties. Content licensing revenue is recognized
over the period of the license agreement as the Company delivers content.
Barter Transactions
The Company recognizes advertising and content licensing revenue as a
result of barter transactions. Such revenue is recognized based on the fair
value of the consideration received, which generally consists of advertising
displayed on the other companies' Web sites. Barter revenue and the
corresponding expense is recognized in the period the advertising is displayed.
Revenue by Type
Revenue by type for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998
was as follows                      2000    1999    1998
Advertising..   $77,666   $29,970   $17,698
Subscription based services..    6,284    5,629    5,032
E-commerce..     126   16,486    3,600
Content licensing and other..   11,811    8,193    4,221
$95,887   $60,278   $30,551
Barter transactions, in which the Company received advertising or other
services or goods in exchange for content or advertising on its Web sites,
accounted for approximately 17%, 17% and 19% of total revenue for the years
ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Barter transactions are
recorded on a basis consistent with similar recent cash transactions of the
Company pursuant to EITF Issue No. 99-17, Accounting for Advertising Barter
Transactions.
Equity transactions, in which the Company received equity in companies
in exchange for advertising and promotion accounted for approximately 16%, 0%
and 0% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. As discussed in Note 3, the majority of equity related revenue was
derived from two agreements, both of which were terminated prior to December 31,
2000.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue consists primarily of content and royalty fees, revenue
sharing, payroll and related expenses for the editorial and operations staff,
telecommunications and computer-related expenses for the support and delivery of
the Company services. Royalty payments are paid to certain content providers
and technology and marketing partners based on membership levels subject, in
certain instances, to specified minimum amounts.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expense consists of salaries and related expenses,
advertising, marketing, promotional, business development, public relations
expenses and member acquisition costs. Member acquisition costs consist
primarily of the direct costs of member solicitation, including advertising on
other Web sites and Internet search engines and the cost of obtaining qualified
prospects from direct marketing programs and third parties. No indirect costs
are included in member acquisition costs. In accordance with American Institute
of Certified Public

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued
Accountants AICPA Statement of Position, 93-7, Reporting on Advertising
Costs, the Company may, in the future, capitalize such direct-response
advertising costs if historical evidence is available to indicate that the
advertising results in a future benefit. Until that time, all such costs are
expensed as incurred. All other advertising and marketing costs are charged to
expense at the time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense for 2000,
1999 and 1998 was $16,217, $10,895 and $6,306, respectively.
Per Share Amounts
In February 1997, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 128, Earnings Per Share, was issued. SFAS No. 128 simplifies the methodology
of computing earnings per share and requires the presentation of basic and
diluted earnings per share. The Company basic and diluted earnings per share
are the same, since the Company common stock equivalents are antidilutive.
Net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of
common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period.
Common equivalent shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon
conversion of all convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method
and shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants using the
treasury stock method. There were approximately 9,685,000, 7,711,000 and
5,187,000 options and warrants outstanding at December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively, that could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future.
Such options and warrants were not included in the computation of diluted loss
per share because to do so would have been antidilutive for all periods
presented.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company financial instruments, primarily consisting of cash and
cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and Convertible Subordinated Notes, approximate fair value due to their
short-term nature and/or market rates of interest.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company cash
management and investment policies restrict investments to low risk,
highly-liquid securities, and the Company performs periodic evaluations of the
credit standing of the financial institutions with which it deals. Accounts
receivable from customers outside the United States are held by Sports.com and
represents about 26% of total receivables. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts which
management believes may have become impaired and, to date, losses have not been
significant. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1,765 and $423 at December
31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and activity for the years ended December 31,
2000, 1999 and 1998 was as follows                    52            SPORTSLINE.COM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company follows the provisions of SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of.
SFAS No. 121 requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used
in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted
cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying
amount of the assets. The amount of the impairment is calculated as the amount
by which carrying value exceeds fair value. SFAS No. 121 also addresses the
accounting for long-lived assets that are expected to be disposed of.
Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation allows either
adoption of a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options
and similar equity instruments or continuation of the measurement of
compensation cost relating to such plans using the intrinsic value based method
of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The Company has elected to continue
to use the intrinsic value based method. Accordingly, pro forma disclosures
required to be presented by SFAS No. 123 for companies continuing to utilize the
intrinsic value based method are presented in Note 7.
Comprehensive Loss
The Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income,
during the year ended December 31, 1998. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for
the reporting and display of comprehensive income loss and its components in a
full set of financial statements. The objective of SFAS No. 130 is to report
comprehensive income loss, a measure of all changes in equity of an enterprise
that result from transactions and other economic events in a period, other than
transactions with owners. The Company has elected to disclose comprehensive loss
in the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders' equity.
Internal Use Software and Web Site Development Costs
The Company adopted SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use effective January 1, 1999. SOP
98-1 establishes criteria for determining which costs of developing or obtaining
internal-use computer software should be charged to expense and which should be
capitalized. Such adoption did not have a material effect on the Company
consolidated financial position or results of operations.
The Emerging Issues Task Force EITF of the FASB reached a consensus
on EITF Issue 00-2, Accounting for Web Site Development Costs. This consensus
provides guidance on what types of costs incurred to develop Web sites should be
capitalized or expensed. The Company adopted this consensus on July 1, 2000.
Such adoption did not have a material effect on the Company consolidated
financial position or results of operations.
Segment Reporting
The Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information for the year ended December 31, 1998. SFAS
No. 131 establishes standards for the way public

business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual
financial statements and requires those enterprises to report selected
information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to
shareholders.
Beginning in the third quarter of 1999, the Company began operating in
two segments. As permitted by SFAS No. 131, the following segment information is
disclosed based on the method management uses to organize financial information
for making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company currently

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities-Deferral of FASB Statement No. 133. SFAS No. 137 defers for one year
the effective date of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 applies to all fiscal quarters of all fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS No. 133, as further amended by SFAS
No. 138, will require the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance
sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. Derivatives that
do not qualify for hedge accounting must be adjusted to fair value through
income. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 133 effective January 1, 2001. The
Company has no derivatives as defined under SFAS No133 and expects no effects
upon adoption.
In July 2000, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue 99-19,
Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent. This consensus
provides guidance concerning under what circumstances a company should report
revenue based on a the gross amount billed to a customer because it has earned
revenue from the sale of goods or services or b the net amount retained that
is, the amount billed to the customer less the amount paid to a supplier
because it has earned a commission or fee. Application of the provisions of this
consensus did not change the Company existing accounting policies.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements. SAB 101 summarizes certain of the SEC views in applying generally
accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements.
In June 2000, the SEC issued SAB No. 101B to defer the effective date of
implementation of SAB 101. The Company adopted SAB 101 in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2000. The adoption of SAB 101 did not have a material effect on the
consolidated financial statements.
3  ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS     The Company acquired International Golf Outlet, Inc. in June 1998 and
TennisDirect.com, Inc. in August 1999, and accounted for these transactions
using the purchase method of accounting. The purchases resulted in goodwill of
$3,180. Such goodwill was being amortized over an estimated life of ten years.
In May 1999, the Company acquired Golf Club Trader, Inc. The purchase was
accounted for using the pooling-of-interests method of accounting. As of January
2000, the aforementioned companies were sold to MVP.com, Inc. MVP in
exchange for an equity interest in MVP resulting in a one-time gain of $7,814.
In addition, the Company entered into a 10-year strategic e-commerce and
marketing agreement with MVP pursuant to which MVP operated the Company
domestic e-commerce business. These transactions with MVP resulted in the
Company receiving an investment in MVP totaling $100,000. Such investment was
initially recorded at estimated fair value. During the third and fourth quarters
of 2000, the Company deemed its investment in MVP to be permanently impaired and
wrote off the entire investment of $100,000. The Company estimate was based on
the market downturn during the third and fourth quarters of 2000, which caused
similar declines in publicly-traded internet e-commerce companies' market
values, the difficulty experienced by MVP in raising additional capital and an
assessment of MVP financial condition and prospects. In November 2000, the
Company terminated its marketing agreement with MVP due to MVP breach of the
agreement. As a result of the termination the Company reversed deferred revenue
of $72,303 which is included in Gain on Termination of Advertising Agreements in
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Additionally, as of December 29, 2000, Internet Sports Network ceased
operations causing the Company to write off its investment of $15,247 during the
fourth quarter of 2000, which the Company had received as part of the
promotional and advertising agreement. Furthermore, several of the Company
other equity investments were adversely affected by the market downturn and were
written down by $12,406 in the third and fourth quarters of 2000. As of December
31, 2000, the Company had equity investments in two companies totaling $528, of
which $500 is guaranteed by a cash escrow account.

Sports.com was formed in May 1999. In May 1999, Sports.com purchased
SportsWeb, which was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and
resulted in goodwill of $584 that is being amortized over five years. In June
1999, Sports.com acquired the sports division of Infosis Group. The Company also
accounted for this transaction using the purchase method of accounting resulting
in goodwill of $2,526, which is being amortized over five years. A liability of
$59,809 has been reflected in the Company consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2000 to reflect the minority interest in Sports.com. As of December
31, 2000, SportsLine owned 71% of the common shares of Sports.com. In 2000, the
Company consolidated between 71% and 100% of the losses of Sports.com, which has
historically been offset by the allocation of a portion of such losses to third
party holders of Sports.com common stock. However, pursuant to United States
generally accepted accounting principles, the Company is only able to allocate
such losses to third party holders of common stock up to the amount of such
third parties' investment in the common stock. Accordingly, in future periods,
excluding any future common stock investments in Sports.com, the Company expects
to recognize 100% of the losses of Sports.com.
The Company acquired Daedalus Worldwide, Inc. in December 1999. The
transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The
purchase resulted in goodwill of $31,880, which is being amortized over an
estimated life of seven years. In the fourth quarter of 2000, a $12,000
liability included in accounts payable at December 31, 2000, was recorded
pursuant to the purchase agreement, which provided for additional consideration
in exchange for meeting certain performance thresholds included in the original
purchase agreement. This amount is expected to be paid during the first and
third quarter of 2001. This additional consideration caused goodwill to increase
by $12,000 and is being amortized over its remaining life.
The Company acquired another business during 1999 and accounted for the
transaction using the purchase method of accounting. The purchase resulted in
goodwill of $3,726, which was being amortized over an estimated life of seven
years. The business was subsequently sold in April 2000 resulting in a gain of
$264.
The Company acquired DBC Sports during 2000 and accounted for this
transaction using the purchase method of accounting. The purchase resulted in
goodwill of $11,831, which is being amortized over an estimated life of seven
years. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, the Company guaranteed the value of
the shares of common stock issued as consideration for the purchase. Due to the
subsequent decline in the trading price of the Company common stock, the
Company expects to re-purchase the shares issued in this acquisition for
approximately $12,500 in cash during the second quarter of 2001.
The purchase prices of the acquisitions accounted for using the
purchase method have been allocated to the assets purchased and liabilities
assumed based upon their fair values at the dates of acquisition. The portion of
the purchase prices being allocated to goodwill are being amortized over a
straight-line basis over seven years. The acquired companies are included in the
Company consolidated financial statements from the dates of acquisition. The
purchase prices for the year ended December 31, 2000 is allocated as follows   Tangible Assets includes cash acquired of $19    $ 399

Pro forma information is required by SFAS No. 123 and has been
determined as if the Company had accounted for its stock-based compensation
plans under the fair value method. The fair value of each option grant was
estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively: risk-free interest rates of 52% to 67%, 46% to 56% and
57% to 67%, dividend yield of 0% for all years, expected volatility factor of
100%, 100% and 65% and expected life of 439 years for all years.

On April 14, 1997, the Company adopted the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
the Purchase Plan and on November 19, 1999 the Purchase Plan was amended to
increase the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance thereunder
to 1,000,000. The Purchase Plan provides eligible employees, as defined therein,
the right to purchase shares of common stock. The purchase price per share will
be equal to 85% of the fair market value as of certain measurement dates. Such
purchases are limited in any calendar year to the lower of 25% of the employee
total annual compensation or $25,000. There were 73,883, 101,561 and 329,085
shares of common stock issued pursuant to the Purchase Plan in 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively.
In January 1996, the Company adopted a retirement plan that qualifies
under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code. Under this plan,
participating employees, as defined, may defer a portion of their pretax
earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limits. There
is currently no matching of employee contributions by the Company.
8 INCOME TAXES     No provision for Federal and state income taxes has been recorded as
the Company has incurred net operating losses through December 31, 2000. At
December 31, 2000, the Company had approximately $97,000 of net operating loss
carryforwards for Federal income tax reporting purposes available to offset
future taxable income; such carryforwards expire beginning in 2009.
Additionally, the Company had $90,000 of capital loss carryforwards. Under the
Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of and benefits from net operating losses
and capital losses carried forward may be impaired or limited in certain
circumstances. Events, which may cause limitations in the amount of net
operating losses that the Company may utilize in any one year, include, but are
not limited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50% over a three-year
period.
Deferred tax assets at December 31, 2000 and 1999 consist primarily of
the tax effect of net operating loss carryforwards, which amounted to
approximately $37,000 and $39,000, respectively. Other deferred tax assets and
liabilities are not significant. The Company has provided a full 100% valuation
allowance on the deferred tax assets at December 31, 2000 and 1999 to reduce
such deferred income tax assets to zero as it is management belief that
realization of such amounts do not meet the criteria required by United States
