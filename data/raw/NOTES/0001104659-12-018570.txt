53 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of PC Mall,Inc. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PC Mall,Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits which were integrated audits in 2011 and 2009. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s/  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Description of Company
PC Mall,Inc. is a leading value added direct marketer of technology products, services and solutions to businesses, government and educational institutions and individual consumers. We go to market through our dedicated sales force of over 700 account executives. We also offer our products, services and solutions through our field service teams, various direct marketing techniques and a limited number of retail stores. Since our founding in 1987, we have served our customers in part by offering them multi-branded hardware solutions from leading brands including HP, Apple, Cisco, Microsoft and Lenovo. Through us, these and other manufacturers are able to reach multiple customer segments including consumers, small and medium sized businesses, large enterprise businesses, as well as state, local and federal governments and educational institutions. We add additional value to our manufacturer partners by being able to sell, deliver and incorporate their products and services into comprehensive solutions with a high degree of customization. Our model also facilitates an efficient supply chain and support mechanism for manufacturers by using a combination of direct marketing, centralized selling and support, and centralized product fulfillment.
In conjunction with our eCost.com acquisition, which is discussed in detail below, beginning with the first quarter of 2011, our management considered the OnSale and eCOST businesses together as a separate segment and report their results accordingly, including revising all historical segment financial information reported herein. As such, in 2011, existing sales under the OnSale brand were no longer reported under the MacMall segment. In 2011, we had five operating segments, SMB, MME, Public Sector, MacMall and OnSale. We include corporate related expenses such as legal, accounting, information technology, product management, certain support services and other administrative costs that are not otherwise allocated to our reportable operating segments in Corporate and Other. In 2011, we generated approximately 37% of our revenue in our MME segment, 35% of our revenue in our SMB segment, 13% of our revenue in our MacMall segment, 12% of our revenue in our Public Sector segment and 3% of our revenue in our OnSale segment.
Our SMB segment consists of sales made primarily to small and medium sized businesses, generally with less than 1,000 employees. The SMB segment utilizes an outbound phone based sales force and, where applicable, a field-based sales force, together with an online extranet customized for individual customers that enables them to manage their IT procurement process. In addition, the SMB segment markets to small businesses through its Small Business Network utilizing its own social network site at www.pcmallsbn.com.
Our MME segment consists of sales made primarily to mid-market and enterprise-sized businesses, generally with more than 1,000 employees, under the SARCOM, NSPI and Abreon brands. The MME segment sells complex products, services and solutions, utilizing a field relationship-based selling model, an outbound phone based sales force, a field service organization and an online extranet.
Our Public Sector segment consists of sales made primarily to federal, state and local governments, as well as educational institutions. The Public Sector segment utilizes an outbound phone and field relationship-based selling model, as well as contract and bid business development teams and an online extranet.
Our MacMall segment historically included sales made under our MacMall brand name via telephone and the Internet to consumers, small businesses and creative professionals.
Our OnSale segment historically included sales made under our OnSale and eCost brand names via the Internet and inbound phone-based sales forces. The OnSale segment has utilized traditional internet marketing as well as our recently developed daily deals business model. Beginning in the first quarter of 2011, in response to what we believe to be a rapidly changing way in which consumers shop and go to market, our OnSale segment expanded its business to enter the market for local daily deals through social commerce. As this market and its related customer buying behaviors have continued to evolve, the daily deals business model is rapidly expanding to include sales of IT products. In response to these developments, we have determined that our strategic objectives can be best achieved by incorporating the best practices, technologies and methodologies we have developed in our stand alone daily deals business into our traditional eCommerce platform and no longer operating a stand alone daily deals business. In the first quarter of 2012, we expect to realign our operating segments by consolidating the OnSale and MacMall segments.
59 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying financial statements included herein are presented on a consolidated basis and include our accounts and the accounts of all of our wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported herein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition
We adhere to the revised guidelines and principles of sales recognition described in ASC 605 formerly Staff Accounting Bulletin No104, Revenue Recognition, issued by the staff of the SEC as a revision to Staff Accounting Bulletin No101, Revenue Recognition. Under ASC 605, product sales are recognized when the title and risk of loss are passed to the customer, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale, delivery has occurred and/or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Under these guidelines, the majority of our sales, including revenue from product sales and gross outbound shipping and handling charges, are recognized upon receipt of the product by the customer. In accordance with our revenue recognition policy, we perform an analysis to estimate the number of days products we have shipped are in transit to our customers using data from our third party carriers and other factors. We record an adjustment to reverse the impact of sale transactions based on the estimated value of products that have shipped, but have not yet been received by our customers, and we recognize such amounts in the subsequent period when delivery has occurred. Changes in delivery patterns or unforeseen shipping delays beyond our control could have a material impact on our revenue recognition for the current period.
For all product sales shipped directly from suppliers to customers, we take title to the products sold upon shipment, bear credit risk, and bear inventory risk for returned products that are not successfully returned to suppliers; therefore, these revenues are recognized at gross sales amounts.
Certain software assurance or subscription products and extended warranties that we sell for which we are not the primary obligor are recognized on a net basis in accordance with ASC 605-45 formerly Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent. Accordingly, such revenues are recognized in net sales either at the time of sale or over the contract period, based on the nature of the contract, at the net amount retained by us, with no cost of goods sold.
When a customer order contains multiple deliverables such as hardware, software and services which are delivered at varying times, we determine whether the delivered items can be considered separate units of accounting as prescribed under ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple-Element Arrangement. For arrangements with multiple units of accounting, arrangement consideration is allocated among the units of accounting, where separable, based on their relative selling price. Relative selling price is determined based on vendor-specific objective evidence, if it exists. Otherwise, third-party evidence of selling price is used, when it is available, and in circumstances when neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence of selling price is available, managements best estimate of selling price is used.
Sales are reported net of estimated returns and allowances, discounts, mail-in rebate redemptions and credit card chargebacks. If the actual sales returns, allowances, discounts, mail-in rebate redemptions or credit card chargebacks are greater than estimated by management, additional expense may be incurred.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold includes product costs, outbound and inbound shipping costs and costs of delivered services, offset by certain market development funds, volume incentive rebates and other consideration from vendors as described in Advertising Costs and Vendor Consideration below.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
All highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less and credit card receivables with settlement terms less than 5 days are considered cash equivalents. Amounts due from credit card processors classified as cash totaled $39 million and $41 million at December31, 2011 and 2010. Checks issued but not presented for payment to the bank, net of available cash subject to a right of offset, totaling $77 million and $07 million as of December31, 2011and 2010 were included in Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our cash management programs result in utilizing available cash to pay down our line of credit.
60 Accounts Receivable
We generate the majority of our accounts receivable through the sale of products and services to certain customers on account. In addition, we record vendor receivables at such time as all conditions have been met that would entitle us to receive such vendor funding, and is thereby considered fully earned.

We extend credit to our customers based upon an evaluation of each customers financial condition and credit history, and generally do not require collateral. No customer accounted for more than 10% of trade accounts receivable at December31, 2011 and 2010. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based upon estimates of future collection. We regularly evaluate our customers financial condition and credit history in determining the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts. We have historically incurred credit losses within managements expectations. We also maintain an allowance for uncollectible vendor receivables, which arise from vendor rebate programs, price protections and other promotions. We determine the sufficiency of the vendor receivable allowance based upon various factors, including payment history. Amounts received from vendors may vary from amounts recorded because of potential non-compliance with certain elements of vendor programs. If the estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts or vendor receivables subsequently proves to be insufficient, additional allowance may be required.
Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of finished goods, and are stated at the lower of cost determined under the first-in, first-out method or market. We had reserves of $15 million and $13 million as of December31, 2011 and 2010, reflecting lower of cost or market pricing and allowance for potential excess and obsolete inventory. As discussed under Revenue Recognition above, we do not record revenue and related cost of goods sold until there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. As such, inventories include goods-in-transit to customers at December31, 2011 and 2010.
A substantial portion of our business is dependent on sales of Apple, HP, and products purchased from other vendors including Adobe, Cisco,IBM,Ingram Micro, Lenovo, Microsoft, Sony, Sun Microsystems and Tech Data. Products manufactured by Apple represented approximately 21%, 21% and 19% of our net sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Products manufactured by HP represented 20%, 20% and 19% of our net sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009.
Advertising Costs and Vendor Consideration
We account for advertising costs in accordance with ASC 340-20 formerly Statement of Position No93-7, Reporting on Advertising Costs. Our advertising expenditures are generally expensed in the period incurred. Total net advertising expenditures, which were included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, were $74 million, $54 million and $85 million in the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
61 We receive vendor consideration from our vendors in the form of cooperative marketing allowances, volume incentive rebates and other programs to support our marketing of their products. Most of our vendor consideration is accrued, when performance required for recognition is completed, as an offset to cost of sales in accordance with ASC 605-50 formerly EITF 02-16, Accounting by a Customer Including a Reseller for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor since such funds are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs incurred by us in selling the vendors products. At the end of any given period, unbilled receivables related to our vendor consideration are included in our Accounts receivable, net of allowances.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as noted below. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their useful lives or the remaining lease term. We also capitalize computer software costs that meet both the definition of internal-use software and defined criteria for capitalization in accordance with ASC 350-40 formerly SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.

We had $86 million and $46 million of unamortized internally developed software at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amounts of our line of credit borrowings and notes payable approximate their fair values based upon the current rates offered to us for obligations of similar terms and remaining maturities.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are carried at historical cost, subject to write-down, as needed, based upon an impairment analysis that we perform annually, or sooner if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not result in an impairment loss. We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December31 of each year. Under ASC 350 formerly SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Events that may create an impairment include, but are not limited to, significant and sustained decline in our stock price or market capitalization, significant underperformance of operating units and significant changes in market conditions. Changes in estimates of future cash flows or changes in market values could result in a write-down of our goodwill in a future period. If an impairment loss results from any impairment analysis as described above, such loss will be recorded as a pre-tax charge to our operating income.
Goodwill impairment testing is a two-step process. Step one involves comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, there is no impairment and no further testing is required. If the reporting units carrying amount is greater than the fair value, the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. Step two calculates the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step one. The implied fair value of goodwill determined in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference.
As of December31, 2011, we performed our annual impairment analysis of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment. Our management, with the assistance of an independent third-party valuation firm, determined the fair values of our reporting units and their underlying assets, and compared them to their respective carrying values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. The carrying value of goodwill was allocated to our reporting units pursuant to ASC 350. As a result of our annual impairment analysis, we have determined that a SARCOM trademark was impaired as a result of a reassessment of its remaining useful life and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $08 million as Impairment of indefinite-lived trademark in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December31, 2011. We have determined that no other impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets existed as of December31, 2011.
62 Fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of a market-based approach and an income approach, as this combination was deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. Under the market-based approach, we utilized information regarding our company and publicly available comparable company and industry information to determine cash flow multiples and revenue multiples that are used to value our reporting units. Under the income approach, we determined fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.
In addition, fair values of our trademarks were determined using the relief from royalty method under the income approach to value. This method applies a market based royalty rate to projected revenues that are associated with the trademarks. Applying the royalty rate to projected revenues resulted in an indication of the pre-tax royalty savings associated with ownership of the trademarks. Projected after-tax royalty savings were discounted to present value at the reporting units weighted average cost of capital, and a tax amortization benefit calculated based on a 15 year life for tax purposes was added.
In conjunction with our annual assessment of goodwill, our valuation techniques did not indicate any impairment as of December31, 2011. In performing the step one analysis of fair value, we concluded that the estimated fair values of each of the Sarcom, Abreon and NSPI reporting units were between 9-10% greater than their individual carrying values. All of our $255 million of goodwill resides within these reporting units. However, in applying the market and income approaches to determining fair value of our reporting units, we rely on a number of significant assumptions and estimates including revenue growth rates and operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others. Our estimates are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which by nature are uncertain and unpredictable. Changes in one or more of these significant estimates or assumptions could affect the results of these impairment reviews. For example, a change of 2-3% in our weighted-average cost of capital assumptions or a significant change in our estimated earnings growth for any of the three reporting units would have resulted in a fair value at, or slightly below, our current carrying value of these reporting units.
As part of our annual review for impairment, we assessed the total fair values of the reporting units and compared total fair value to our market capitalization at December31, 2011, including the implied control premium, to determine if the fair values are reasonable compared to external market indicators. When comparing our market capitalization to the discounted cash flow models for each reporting unit summed together, the implied control premium was between 20-25% as of December31, 2011. We believe several factors are contributing to our low market capitalization, including the lack of trading volume in our stock and the recent significant investments made in various parts of our business and their effects on analyst earnings models.
Given continuing economic uncertainties and related risks to our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing as of December31, 2011 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. We may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods, whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing as of December31, 2012 or prior to that, if any change constitutes a triggering event outside of the quarter from when the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test is performed. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material.
We amortize other intangible assets with definite lives generally on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets
We review long-lived assets and certain intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In the event the undiscounted future cash flow attributable to the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Changes in estimates of future cash flows attributable to the long-lived assets could result in a write-down of the asset in a future period.
Debt Issuance Costs
We defer costs incurred to obtain our credit facility and amortize these costs to interest expense using the straight-line method over the term of the respective obligation.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the liability method as prescribed in accordance with ASC 740 formerly SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the tax basis and financial reporting amounts of existing assets and liabilities. We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax provisions and benefits, in assessing the likelihood of recovering our deferred tax assets and in evaluating our tax positions. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. See Note 8 for more detailed information.
We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with ASC 740 formerly FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No109, which we adopted on January1, 2007. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. Only tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold may be recognized. Under ASC 740, we recognize penalties and interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as part of Income tax expense benefit in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
63 Sales Taxes
We present sales tax we collect from our customers on a net basis excluded from our revenues, a presentation which is prescribed as one of two methods available under ASC 605-45-50-3 formerly EITF Issue No06-03, How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement That Is, Gross Versus Net Presentation.
Stock-Based Compensation
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718 formerly Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment, using the modified prospective application transition method. ASC 718 addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. ASC 718 generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Pursuant to ASC 718, we estimate the grant date fair value of each stock option grant awarded pursuant to ASC 718 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and management assumptions made regarding various factors, including expected volatility of our common stock, expected life of options granted and estimated forfeiture rates, which require extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates. In estimating our assumption regarding expected term for options we granted during the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we computed the expected term based upon an analysis of historical exercises of stock options by our employees. We compute our expected volatility using historical prices of our common stock for a period equal to the expected term of the options. The risk free interest rate is determined using the implied yield on U.S. Treasury issues with a remaining term within the contractual life of the award. We estimate an annual forfeiture rate based on our historical forfeiture data, which rate will be revised, if necessary, in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Any material change in the estimates used in calculating the stock-based compensation expense could result in a material impact on our results of operations.
Foreign Currency Translation
The local currency of our foreign operations is their functional currency. The financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with ASC 830-30 formerly SFAS No52, Foreign Currency Translation. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of our Canadian and Philippine subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate for each month within the year. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss, a separate component of stockholders equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. All transaction gains or losses are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. These gains or losses were not material in any of the years presented in our consolidated financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, Comprehensive Income ASU 2011-12, which amends existing guidance by allowing only two options for presenting the components of net income and other comprehensive income: 1 in a single continuous financial statement, statement of comprehensive income or 2 in two separate but consecutive financial statements, consisting of an income statement followed by a separate statement of other comprehensive income. There is currently a proposal to defer the requirement to disclose items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements. ASU 2011-12 requires retrospective application, and it is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The new standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In September2011, the FASB issued ASU No2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment ASU 2011-08, which allows entities to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment. ASU 2011-08 permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. The adoption of the provisions of this accounting guidance effective January1, 2012 is not expected to have any effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
64 3. Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-Based Benefit Plans
1994 Stock Incentive Plan
In November1994, our Board of Directors and stockholders approved the 1994 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended in May2000 and June2002 and approved by our Board of Directors and stockholders the 1994 Plan, which provides for the grant of equity awards such as stock options, restricted stock or restricted stock units to our employees, officers, directors and consultants. The 1994 Plan has an evergreen provision which automatically increases the number of shares of our common stock available for issuance under the 1994 Plan as of January1 of each year by three percent of our outstanding common stock as of December31 of the immediately preceding fiscal year. Under the 1994 Plan, we may grant options Incentive Stock Options within the meaning of Section422A of the Internal Revenue Code, or options not intended to qualify as Incentive Stock Options Nonstatutory Stock Options.
The 1994 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Subject to the provisions of the 1994 Plan, the Compensation Committee has the authority to select the employees, officers, directors and consultants to whom options are granted and determine the terms of each option, including ithe number of shares of common stock covered by the option, iiwhen the option becomes exercisable, iiithe options exercise price, which must be at least 100% of the fair market value of the common stock as of the date of grant with respect to Incentive Stock Options, and ivthe duration of the option which may not exceed ten years. All options generally vest over three to five years, expire ten years from the grant date, are granted at exercise prices equal to the market price of our stock at grant date and are nontransferable other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. The Compensation Committee has delegated to our Chief Executive Officer the authority to approve option grants to eligible employees under the 1994 Plan other than executive officers, subject to certain numerical limits. The Compensation Committee has delegated to our Chief Executive Officer the authority to approve option grants to eligible employees under the 1994 Plan other than executive officers, subject to certain numerical limits.
At December31, 2011, a total of 778,200 shares of authorized and unissued shares were available for future grants. All options granted through December31, 2011 have been Nonstatutory Stock Options. We satisfy stock option exercises with newly issued shares.
Stock-Based Compensation
For the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 and 2008, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $24 million, $24 million and $17 million in Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and related deferred income tax benefits of $09 million, $09 million and $08 million.
Valuation Assumptions
We estimated the grant date fair value of each stock option grant awarded during the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 pursuant to ASC 718 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and management assumptions made regarding various factors which require extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates. In estimating our assumption regarding the expected term for options granted during the year ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we computed the expected term based upon an analysis of historical exercises of stock options by our employees. We computed our expected volatility using historical prices of our common stock for a period equal to the expected term of the options, which we determined to be six years for grants made during each of the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. The risk free interest rate was determined using the implied yield on U.S. Treasury issues with a remaining term within the contractual life of the award. Each year, we estimated an annual forfeiture rate based on our historical forfeiture data, which rate is revised, if necessary, in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

On March 6, 2012, our Compensation Committee approved and granted, under our 1994 Plan, the award of options to purchase 200,000 shares of our common stock to Mark T. McGrath, our new President. These options were issued at an exercise price of $554 with a ten-year life, and vest quarterly over a five-year term.
Restricted Stock
On August21, 2009, our Compensation Committee approved and granted, under our 1994 Plan, the award of 7,500 shares of restricted stock to each of our non-employee members of the board for a total award of 22,500 shares of restricted stock. The restricted stock awards each vested quarterly in equal amounts over a one year period from the date of grant. In accordance with ASC 718 formerly SFAS 123R, we valued the restricted stock award at fair value as of the grant date and we recognized compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The grant date fair values of restricted stock awards which vested during 2010 and 2009 were $134,831 and $125,224.
As of December31, 2011, there was $43 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested outstanding stock options. We expect to recognize these costs over a weighted average period of 308 years.
4. Acquisitions
eCOST.com
On February18, 2011, we acquired certain assets, including approximately $1 million of inventory, of eCOST.com, a subsidiary of PFSweb,Inc., for $23 million. Also, as part of this acquisition, we assumed certain liabilities related to a web-based promotional membership program available on eCOST.coms website and liabilities with respect to customer warranty claims, credits, returns and refunds related to transactions of eCOST.coms business or through the website from and after the acquisition date. eCOST.com is an online marketplace featuring an assortment of product categories, including but not limited to computers, networking, electronics and entertainment, TVs, monitors and projectors, cameras and camcorders, memory and storage, apparel, and sports and leisure items. The website also features a proprietary and patented shopping format, Bargain Countdown, which amongst other features, offers limited 
66 time, limited quantity deals, and supports its premium online membership shopping club. eCOST.com commenced business in 1999 as a subsidiary of PC Mall. In September2004, eCOST.com completed an initial public offering of approximately 198% of its outstanding common stock. In April2005, we completed a spin-off of eCOST.com by distributing all of our remaining ownership interest in eCOST.com to our stockholders. In February2006, eCOST.com was acquired by PFSweb in a stock for stock merger.
NSPI
In June2010, Sarcom,Inc. SARCOM, our wholly-owned subsidiary, completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Network Services Plus,Inc. NSPI. NSPI, primarily a provider of hosted data center and managed IT services in the southeastern United States, had approximately 73 employees as of the closing date, 53 of whom are billable IT resources. The terms of the transaction included an initial purchase price of $78 million, less a customary hold-back to settle possible indemnity claims.In addition, we extinguished substantially all of NSPIs indebtedness that existed immediately prior to the closing date of our acquisition. We have recorded identifiable intangible assets of $26 million related to customer relationships, $05 million related to trademarks and $03 million related to a non-compete agreement, with estimated useful lives of 10, 10 and 4 years, respectively. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement, NSPIs shareholders can earn additional consideration based on the performance of the NSPI business over two years following the acquisition, up to a total of approximately $52 million. In accordance with ASC 805, Purchase Price Allocations formerly FAS No141R, based on a valuation of the fair value of the contingent consideration, we initially recorded additional goodwill and a corresponding liability of $32 million for future earnout payments. Such valuation is based upon managements initial forecasts of expected profitability of NSPI during the earnout period, and will be updated, if necessary, in future periods with adjustments reflected in our consolidated statement of operations. In 2011, we recorded an adjustment to reduce the earnout liability by $12 million to reflect the decrease in estimated fair value of the earnout liability, and such adjustment is reflected as Revaluation of earnout liability on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, including fixed assets under capital leases, for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled $78 million, 63 million and $40 million.
In March 2011, we completed the purchase of the real property comprising approximately 82,000 square feet of office space located at 1940 East Mariposa Avenue, El Segundo, California, which became our new corporate headquarters. We moved into this building from our current headquarters located in Torrance, California in November 2011. The total purchase price was $96 million. Based on the proportionate appraised values, we allocated $74 million of the purchase price to land and $22 million to building. We made certain improvements to the property and made purchases of additional furniture and equipment totaling approximately $76 million as of December 31, 2011.
In June2011, we entered into a credit agreement to finance the purchase and improvement of this real property. The credit agreement provides a commitment for a loan up to $109 million of which there was $72 million outstanding at December 31, 2011. See Note 7 below for more information. In February 2012, we drew down an additional $29 million on this facility. Principal repayment began in March 2012.
In February 2012 we entered into capital lease agreements with US Bank for approximately $30 million for various furniture and equipment at our El Segundo headquarters office. We expect to enter into approximately $13 million of additional capital lease agreements in the near term.

Amortization expense for intangible assets was $22 million, $19 million and $15 million in each of the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
Estimated amortization expense for intangible assets in each of the next five years and thereafter, as applicable, as of December31, 2011 is as follows: $27 million in 2012, $18 million in 2013, $06 million in 2014, $05 million in 2015, $03 million in 2016 and $10 million thereafter.
7. Line of Credit and Note Payable
We maintain an asset-based revolving credit facility, as amended from time to time and most recently amended as of December14, 2010, of up to $160 million from a lending unit of a large commercial bank. The credit facility provides for, among other things, ia credit limit of $160 million, which may be increased in increments of $5 million up to a total credit limit of $180 million, provided that any increase of the total credit limit in excess of $160 million is subject to, among other things, an acceptance and commitment by the lenders to such excess amount and a line increase fee not to exceed 065% of the increased amount; iiLIBOR interest rate options that we can enter into with no limit on the maximum outstanding principal balance which may be subject to a LIBOR interest rate option; and iiia maturity date of March31,2015. The credit facility, which functions as a working capital line of credit with a borrowing base of inventory and accounts receivable, including certain credit card receivables, also includes a monthly unused line fee of 025% per year on the amount, if any, by which the Maximum Credit, as defined in the agreement, then in effect, exceeds the average daily principal balance of the outstanding borrowings during the immediately preceding month. There can be no assurance that the lenders, if we elected to increase the credit limit, will commit to the remaining excess $20 million of credit beyond the $160 million in any future period. As a result, we may not be able to access the credit facility beyond its current limit of $160 million.
The credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of our assets. In addition to the security interest required by the credit facility, certain of our vendors have security interests in some of our assets related to their products. The credit facility has as its single financial covenant a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio FCCR requirement in the event an FCCR triggering event has occurred. An FCCR triggering event is comprised of maintaining certain specified daily and average excess availability thresholds. In the event the FCCR covenant applies, the fixed charge coverage ratio is 10 to 10 for each twelve-month periods ending on or after December31, 2011. At December31, 2011, we were in compliance with our financial covenant.
68 Loan availability under the line of credit fluctuates daily and is affected by many factors, including eligible assets on-hand, opportunistic purchases of inventory and availability and utilization of early-pay discounts. At December31, 2011, we had $919 million of net working capital advances outstanding under the line of credit. At December31, 2011, the maximum credit line was $160 million and we had $497 million available to borrow for working capital advances under the line of credit.
In connection with and as part of the amended credit facility, we entered into an amended term note on December14, 2010 with a principal balance of $287 million, payable in equal monthly principal installments beginning on January1, 2011, plus interest at the prime rate with a LIBOR option. The amended term note matures in December2017 or in the event of a default, termination or non-renewal of our credit facility, is payable in its entirety upon demand by our lender. At December31, 2011, we had $246 million outstanding under the amended term note. The remaining balance of our term note matures as follows: $410,000 annually in each of the years 2012 through 2017.
At December31, 2011, our effective weighted average annual interest rate on outstanding amounts under the credit facility and term note was 236%.
At December31, 2011, $02 million relating to the financing of our purchase of Microsoft AX Axapta, which is a part of our ERP upgrade, were included in our Notes payable current on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Other Planned Capital Projects below for a detailed discussion.
In June2011, we entered into a credit agreement to finance the acquisition and improvement of real property we purchased in March2011 in El Segundo, California. The credit agreement provides for a lending commitment for a loan up to $109 million with a five year term and a 25 year straight-line principal repayment amortization period with a balloon payment at maturity. Interest is variable, indexed to Prime plus a spread of 0375% or LIBOR plus a spread of 2375% at our option, payable monthly. At December31, 2011, we had $72 million outstanding under this credit agreement. The loan is secured by the real property and contains financial covenants substantially similar to those of our existing asset-based credit facility. In February2012, we drew down an additional $29 million under this credit agreement. See Note 16 for more information.
The carrying amounts of our line of credit borrowings and notes payable approximate their fair value based upon the current rates offered to us for obligations of similar terms and remaining maturities.

The valuation allowance relates entirely to state net operating loss carryforwards generated by subsidiaries in a cumulative loss position.
Current deferred tax liabilities relating to foreign employment tax subsidy of $20 million and $15 million at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, as provided in the table above, were included as part of Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
At December31, 2011, we had state net operating loss carryforwards of $316 million, which begin to expire at the end of 2013, and federal net operating loss carryforwards and carrybacks of $127 million, which begin to expire at the end of 2024. $53 million of the federal net operating loss carryforwards and $25 million of the state net operating loss carryforwards relate to pre-acquisition losses from an acquired subsidiary and, accordingly, are subject to annual limitations as to their use under the provisions of IRC Section382. As such, the extent to which these losses may offset future taxable income may be limited.
The exercise of stock options and warrants in 2011 and 2010 resulted in no tax benefits in 2011 and approximately $34,000 in 2010 that have been reflected as a reduction of taxes payable and an increase to additional paid-in capital.
Accounting for Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the tax bases and financial reporting amounts of existing assets and liabilities. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon sufficient taxable income within the carryback years and the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers taxable income in carryback years, if carryback is permitted in the tax law, the projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and the projections for future taxable income over the periods when the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize all of these deductible differences. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward periods are reduced.
70 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
At December31, 2011, we had no material unrecognized tax positions. For the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we did not recognize any interest or penalties for uncertain tax positions. There were also no accrued interest and penalties at December31, 2011 and December31, 2010. Since we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2011, we do not, accordingly, anticipate any significant increases or decreases within the next twelve months.
We have elected to classify interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities, when applicable, as part of interest and penalty expense in our consolidated statement of income rather than as a component of income tax expense.
We are subject to U.S. and foreign income tax examinations for years subsequent to 2007, and state income tax examinations for years following 2006. In addition, certain federal and state net operating loss carryforwards generated after 2003 and 1997, respectively, and used in a subsequent year, may still be adjusted by a taxing authority upon examination.
9. Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
We lease office and warehouse space and equipment under various non-cancelable operating leases which provide for minimum annual rentals and escalations based on increases in real estate taxes and other operating expenses. We also have minimum commitments under non-cancelable contracts for services relating to telecommunications,IT maintenance, financial services and employment contracts with certain employees which consist of severance arrangements that, if exercised, would become payable in less than one year. In addition, we have obligations under capital leases for computers and related equipment, telecommunications equipment and software. As of December31, 2011, minimum payments over the terms of applicable contracts were payable as follows in thousands

Other  commitments consist of minimum commitments under non-cancelable contracts for  services relating to telecommunications,IT maintenance, financial  services and employment contracts with certain employees which consist of  severance arrangements that, if exercised, would become payable in less than  one year.    b  
Standby  LOCs are commitments issued to third party beneficiaries, underwritten by a  third party bank, representing funding responsibility in the event of third  party demands or contingent events. The outstanding balance of our standby  LOCs reduces the amount available to us from our revolving credit facility.  The LOC amounts in the table above represent the amount of commitment  expiration per period presented. There were no claims made against any  standby LOCs during the year ended December31, 2011.    c  
Earn-out  represents the fair value of the future contingent liability, arising from  our acquisition of NSPI, as it is recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet  under Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. At completion of  acquisition of NSPI in June2010, the fair value of the earn-out was  based on an initial valuation of the fair value of the contingent consideration,  under which the sellers of NSPI can earn up to a total of approximately $52  million over a two year period commencing from the acquisition date. The  earn-out amounts in the table above represent the fair value of the  contingent liability at December31, 2011 and the respective earn-out  periods.     
For the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, total rent expense, net of sublease income, totaled $66 million, $66 million and $63 million. Some of the leases contain renewal options and escalation clauses, and require us to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance costs.
In February2012, AF Services, LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a capital lease agreements with US Bank for approximately $30 million of various furniture and equipment at our El Segundo headquarters office. See Note 16 below for more detailed information.
On February28, 2012, we drew down an additional $29 million on our existing credit facility which finances the acquisition and improvement of the real property we purchased in El Segundo, California. Principal repayment began in March2012.
71 ERP and Web Infrastructure Upgrades
We are currently upgrading many of our IT systems. We have purchased licenses for Microsoft Dynamics AX Axapta and other related tools, such as workflow software, web development tools and other related items, to upgrade our ERP and eCommerce systems. We initiated the implementation and upgrade of our eCommerce system in the second half of 2008 and have completed and launched a new generation of our public sites at macmall.com, onsale.com, ecost.com and pcmall.com. We are currently working on the implementation of the ERP modules and the upgrade of the ERP systems, including additional enhancements and features, and we expect to be complete with all phases of the implementation of the ERP systems by 2013. We believe the implementation and upgrade should help us to gain further efficiencies across our organization. Based on our estimates, which are subject to change, we currently expect to incur a total cost of up to $14 million for all these IT system upgrades. To date, we have incurred approximately $108 million of such costs. In addition to the above expenditures, we expect on an ongoing basis to make periodic upgrades to our IT systems.
In addition to the upgrades to our IT systems, in July2008, we entered into an agreement with Cisco Systems for the purchase and implementation of various solutions to upgrade our current infrastructure for up to approximately $46 million. The purchase is financed through a capital lease over a five year term. Our plan is to provide a unified platform for our entire company and to provide a robust and efficient contact center. To date, we have received all of the Cisco equipment. We completed the implementation of the Cisco solution across all of our locations in the second quarter of 2011.
Legal Proceedings
We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings with loss contingencies, which are expected to be material. From time to time, we receive claims of and become subject to consumer protection, employment, intellectual property and other litigation related to the conduct of our business. Any such litigation could result in a material amount of legal or related expenses and be time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. In connection with any such litigation, we may be subject to significant damages or equitable remedies relating to the operation of our business. Any such litigation may materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
10. Stockholders Equity
In October2008, our Board of Directors approved a discretionary common stock repurchase program for up to $10 million of our common stock in aggregate with all other repurchases made under any repurchase programs following the date of such Board of Directors approval. This repurchase program effectively superseded an earlier repurchase program adopted in 1996. Under this new program, the shares may be repurchased from time to time at prevailing market prices, through open market or unsolicited negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions. We expect that the repurchase of our common stock under this new program will be financed with existing working capital and amounts available under our existing credit facility. No limit was placed on the duration of the repurchase program. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that we will repurchase. Subject to applicable securities laws, repurchases may be made at such times and in such amounts as our management deems appropriate. The program can also be discontinued at any time management feels additional purchases are not warranted.
During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we repurchased a total of 432,012 shares, 200,084 shares and 582,779 shares of our common stock at an annual aggregate cost of $26 million, $09 million and $26 million, respectively. The repurchased shares were recorded as treasury stock. As of December31, 2011 and 2010, we had total treasury shares of 2,373,184 and 1,941,172 shares, respectively. The common shares held as treasury stock are available for general corporate purposes.
We have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock and our credit facility prohibits us from paying any cash dividends on our capital stock. Therefore, we do not currently anticipate paying dividends; we intend to retain any earnings to finance the growth and development of our business.
11. Earnings Per Common Share
Basic earnings per share EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reported periods. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur under the treasury stock method if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised, except in loss periods where the effect would be antidilutive. Potential common shares of approximately 1,110,000, 1,395,000 and 1,666,000 for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because the effect of their inclusion would be antidilutive.

12. Employee Non-Employee Benefits
401kSavings Plan
We maintain a 401kSavings Plan which covers substantially all full-time employees who meet the plans eligibility requirements. Participants are allowed to make tax-deferred contributions up to limitations specified by the Internal Revenue Code. We make 25% matching contributions for amounts that do not exceed 4% of the participants compensation. The matched contributions to the employees are subject to a 5 year vesting provision, with credit given towards vesting for employment during prior years. We made matching contributions to the plan totaling approximately $493,000, $733,000 and $406,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Restricted Stock, Stock Warrants and Options Issued to Non-employees
On September15, 2011, our Compensation Committee approved and granted, under our 1994 Plan, the award of options to purchase 10,000 shares of our common stock to each of our non-employee members of our board. These options were issued at an exercise price of $624 with a ten-year term, and vests quarterly over a two-year term.
On August18, 2010, our Compensation Committee approved and granted, under our 1994 Plan, the award of options to purchase 10,000 shares of our common stock to each of our non-employee members of our board. These options were issued at an exercise price of $422 with a ten-year term, and vests quarterly over a two-year term. See Note 3 for more information on our accounting for stock-based compensation.
On March2, 2010, our Compensation Committee approved and granted, under our 1994 Plan, the award of options to purchase 20,000 shares of our common stock to a third-party investor relations consultant. The options were issued at an exercise price of $476 with a five-year term and vest quarterly over a one-year term. We valued the options at fair value at grant date based on a Black-Scholes fair value calculation and the options were measured at fair value at each subsequent reporting period, with changes in value recorded over the twelve month performance period of the option.
73 On August21, 2009 and July31, 2008, our Compensation Committee approved and granted, under our 1994 Plan, the award of 7,500 shares and 4,000 shares, respectively, of restricted stock to each of our non-employee members of our board for a total award of 22,500 shares and 12,000 shares of restricted stock. The restricted stock awards each vest quarterly in equal amounts over a one year period from the date of grant.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rulesand forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules13a-15eand 15d-15eunder the Exchange Act as of the end of our most recent fiscal year. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December31, 2011.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
No change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15fand 15d-15funder the Exchange Act occurred during the fourth quarter of 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules13a-15fand 15d-15fpromulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officers, has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011. In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria described in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on this assessment and those criteria, management believes that, as of December31, 2011, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
