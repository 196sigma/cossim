below in this section. This section should be read in conjunction with the certifications and the report of KPMG LLP for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.  Controls and Procedures. Based on an evaluation as of May 31, 2005, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were sufficiently effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission was recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding its required disclosure in reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter
ended May 31, 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.  Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls. Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors or fraud. An internal control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations
in all internal control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, errors and instances of fraud, if any, within Verity, Inc. have been detected.
