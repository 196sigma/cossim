Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data.   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   The Board of Directors and Stockholders   California Water Service Group   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
California Water Service Group and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
statements of income, common stockholders equity and
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December31, 2006. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
management of California Water Service Group. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of California Water Service Group and subsidiaries as
of December31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2006, in conformity
with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles.   As discussed in Note2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, effective January1, 2006, California Water
Service Group adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No123 revised 2004,
Share-Based Payment, and effective December31,
2006, California Water Service Group adopted the initial funded
status recognition and disclosure provisions of
SFASNo158, Employers Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. In
addition, California Water Service Group changed its method for
quantifying errors in its financial statements in 2006.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of
California Water Service Group and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, and our report dated March9, 2007
expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment
of, and the effective operation of, internal control over
financial reporting   /s/ KPMG LLP   Mountain View, California   March9, 2007   
46 Table of Contents   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   The Board of Directors and Stockholders   California Water Service Group   We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting, that California Water Service Group and
subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on the
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Management of
California Water Service Group is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
of California Water Service Group and subsidiaries based on our
audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   In our opinion, managements assessment that California
Water Service Group and subsidiaries maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework, issued by the
COSO. Also, in our opinion, California Water Service Group and
subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued
by the COSO.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of California Water Service Group
and subsidiaries as of December31, 2006 and 2005, and the
related consolidated statements of income, common
stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2006, and our report dated March9, 2007
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements.   /s/ KPMG LLP   Mountain View, CA   March9, 2007

California, Washington, New Mexico, and Hawaii through its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. California Water Service Company Cal
Water, Washington Water Service Company Washington Water, New
Mexico Water Service Company New Mexico Water, and Hawaii
Water Service Company, Inc. Hawaii Water provide regulated
utility services under the rules and regulations of their

to as the Commissions. CWS Utility Services provides
non-regulated water utility and utility-related services.   The Company operates primarily in one business segment,
providing water and related utility services.

SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Principles of Consolidation and Accounting
RecordsThe consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated. The accounting records of the Company are maintained
in accordance with the uniform system of accounts prescribed by
the Commissions.   ReclassificationsCertain other prior
years amounts have been reclassified, where necessary, to
conform to the current year presentation.   On the balance sheet, prior year amounts for the non-current
portion of the liability for postretirement benefits other than
pension in the amount of $10,191 and the non-current portion of
the liability for supplemental executive retirement plan in the
amount of $3,600 were reclassified from current liabilities to
the non-current liability entitled Pension and postretirement
benefits other than pensions, as such amounts were not expected
to be paid within one year of the balance sheet date. In
addition, non-regulated income and non-regulated expenses which
were previously netted in the income statement have been broken
out separately. Also, prior year amounts for income taxes
associated with other income and expenses were reclassified from
income taxes included in operating expenses.   On the statement of cash flows, prior year amounts for the
company funded utility plant expenditures and accounts payable
have been reduced for non-cash activities.   Use of EstimatesThe preparation of
consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.   RevenueRevenue consists primarily of monthly
cycle customer billings for regulated water and waste water
services at rates authorized by the Commissions and billings to
certain non-regulated customers. Revenue from metered accounts
includes unbilled amounts based on the estimated usage from the
latest meter reading to the end of the accounting period.
Flat-rate accounts, which are billed at the beginning of the
service period, are included in revenue on a pro rata basis for
the portion applicable to the current accounting period.   Revenues from regulated customers include fees that are paid to
the Commissions. This amount is recorded in revenue and in other
operating expenses. Fees paid to the Commissions were $4,483 in
2006, $4,123 in 2005, and $4,088 in 2004.   The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts. The
balance of customer receivables is net of the allowance for
doubtful accounts at December31, 2006 and 2005 of $260 and
$272, respectively.

260     272   Non-Regulated RevenueRevenues from
non-regulated operations and maintenance agreements are
recognized when services have been rendered to companies or
municipalities under such agreements. Other non-regulated
revenue is recognized when title has transferred to the buyer,
or ratably over the term of the lease. For construction and
design services, revenue is generally recognized on the
completed contract method, as most projects are completed in
less than three months.   Expense Balancing and Memorandum
AccountsExpense balancing and memorandum
accounts are used to track suppliers rate changes for
purchased water, purchased power, and pump taxes that are not
included in customer water rates. The cost changes are referred
to as Offsetable Expenses because under certain
circumstances they are recoverable from customers or refunded
to customers in future rates designed to offset the cost
changes from the suppliers. The Company does not record the
balancing and memorandum accounts until the Commission has
authorized a change in customer rates and the customer has been
billed.   Utility PlantUtility plant is carried at
original cost when first constructed or purchased, except for
certain minor units of property recorded at estimated fair
values at the date of acquisition. When depreciable plant is
retired, the cost is eliminated from utility plant accounts and
such costs are charged against accumulated depreciation.
Maintenance of utility plant is charged to operating expenses as
incurred. Maintenance projects are not accrued for in advance.
Interest is capitalized on plant expenditures during the
construction period and amounted to $2,700 in 2006, $900 in
2005, and $824 in 2004.   Intangible assets acquired as part of water systems purchased
are stated at amounts as prescribed by the Commissions. All
other intangibles have been recorded at cost and are amortized
over their useful life. Included in intangible assets is $6,515
paid to the City of Hawthorne in 1996 to lease the citys
water system and associated water rights. The asset is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over the
15-year life
of the lease.   The following table represents depreciable plant and equipment
as of December31

The provision for depreciation expressed as a percentage of the
aggregate depreciable asset balances was 26% in 2006, 27% in
2005, and 26% in 2004. For income tax purposes, as applicable,
the Company computes depreciation using the accelerated methods
allowed by the respective taxing authorities. Plant additions
since June 1996 are depreciated on a straight-line basis for tax
purposes in accordance with tax regulations.   
53 Table of Contents   Notes to
Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   Cash EquivalentsCash equivalents include
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less. As of December31, 2006 and 2005, cash
equivalents included investments in money market funds in the
amount of $53,896 and $4,003, respectively.   Restricted CashRestricted cash primarily
represents proceeds collected through a surcharge on certain
customers bills plus interest earned on the proceeds and
is used to service California Safe Drinking Water Bond
obligations. All restricted cash is classified in other prepaid
expenses. At December31, 2006 and 2005, restricted cash
was $1,304 and $1,200, respectively.   Regulatory Assets and LiabilitiesThe Company
operates extensively in a regulated business, and as such is
subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No71, Accounting for the Effects
of Certain Types of Regulations. In accordance with
SFASNo71, the Company records regulatory assets for
future revenues expected to be realized in customers rates
when certain items are recognized as expenses for rate making
purposes. The income tax temporary differences relate primarily
to the difference between book and federal income tax
depreciation on utility plant that was placed in service before
the regulatory Commissions adopted normalization for rate making
purposes. Previously, the tax benefit of tax depreciation was
passed onto customers flow-through. For state income tax
purposes, the Commission continues to use the flow-through
method. As such timing differences reverse, the Company will be
able to include the impact of such differences in customer
rates. These federal tax differences will continue to reverse
over the remaining book lives of the related assets.   In addition, regulatory assets include expense items that are
capitalized for financial statement purposes, because they will
be recovered in future customer rates. The capitalized expenses
relate to asset retirement obligations, pension benefits,
postretirement benefits other than pensions Retiree Group
Health, and accrued benefits for vacation, self-insured
workers compensation, and directors retirement benefits.
Asset retirement obligations are recorded net of depreciation
which has been recorded and recognized through the regulatory
process.   Regulatory liabilities represent future benefits to ratepayers
for tax deductions that will be allowed in the future.
Regulatory liabilities also reflect timing differences provided
at higher than the current tax rate, which will flow-through to
future ratepayers.   Regulatory assets and liabilities are comprised of the following
as of December31   	
2006   2005   Regulatory Assets   Income tax temporary differences
35,213     32,856   Asset retirement obligations, net

93,785     58,213   Regulatory
Liabilities   Future tax benefits due ratepayers
19,954     18,782   Long-Lived AssetsThe Company regularly
reviews its long-lived assets for impairment, annually or when
events or changes in business circumstances have occurred that
indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully
realizable. Potential impairment of assets held for use is
determined by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the
future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset. If assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment
to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying
value of the asset exceeds its fair value. There have been no
asset impairments as of December31, 2006 and 2005.   Long-Term Debt Premium, Discount and
ExpenseThe discount and issuance expense on
long-term debt is amortized over the original lives of the
related debt issues on a straight-line basis which approximates
the effective   
54 Table of Contents   Notes to
Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   interest rate. Premiums paid on the early redemption of certain
debt issues and the unamortized original issue discount and
expense are amortized over the life of new debt issued in
conjunction with the early redemption. Amortization expense
included in interest expense was $665, $661, and $660 for 2006,
2005, and 2004, respectively.   Accumulated Other Comprehensive LossThe
Company has an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.
In 2005, the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation of the
plan, less the accrued benefit, exceeded the unrecognized prior
service cost which was recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive loss, net of tax, as a separate component of
Stockholders Equity. In 2006, with the adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No158,
Employers Accounting for Retired Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans the Company determined that the
amount should be reflected as a regulatory asset, as it will be
recovered in future customer rates. As a result, during 2006,
the Company recognized $1,202 of net accumulated other
comprehensive loss as a regulatory asset.   Advances for ConstructionAdvances for
Construction consist of payments received from developers for
installation of water production and distribution facilities to
serve new developments. Advances are excluded from rate base for
rate setting purposes. Annual refunds are made to developers
without interest. Advances of $157,126, and $141,168 at
December31, 2006, and 2005, respectively, are refunded
primarily over a
40-year
period in equal annual amounts. In addition, other Advances for
Construction totaling $534 and $674 at December31, 2006,
and 2005, respectively, are refundable based upon customer
connections. Estimated refunds of advances for each succeeding
year 2007 through 2011are approximately $5,321, $5,254,
$5,287, $5,222, $5,218, and $131,358 thereafter.   Contributions in Aid of
ConstructionContributions in Aid of Construction
represent payments received from developers, primarily for fire
protection purposes, which are not subject to refunds.
Facilities funded by contributions are included in utility
plant, but excluded from rate base. Depreciation related to
assets acquired from contributions is charged to Contributions
in Aid of Construction account.   Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income
taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Measurement of the deferred tax assets and
liabilities is at enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
the period that includes the enactment date.   It is anticipated that future rate action by the Commissions
will reflect revenue requirements for the tax effects of
temporary differences recognized, which have previously been
flowed through to customers. The Commissions have granted the
Company rate increases to reflect the normalization of the tax
benefits of the federal accelerated methods and available
Investment Tax Credits ITC for all assets placed in service
after 1980. ITCs are deferred and amortized over the lives of
the related properties for book purposes.   Advances for Construction and Contributions in Aid of
Construction received from developers subsequent to 1986 were
taxable for federal income tax purposes and subsequent to 1991
were subject to California income tax. In 1996, the federal tax
law, and in 1997, the California tax law, changed and only
deposits for new services were taxable. In late 2000, federal
regulations were further modified to exclude contributions of
fire services from taxable income.   Workers Compensation, General Liability and Other
ClaimsFor workers compensation, the
Company utilized an actuary firm to estimate the discounted
liability associated with claims submitted and claims not yet
submitted based on historical data. For general liability claims
and other claims, the Company estimates the cost incurred but
not yet paid using historical information.   Collective Bargaining AgreementsAs of
December31, 2006, the Company had 869 employees, including
577 non-supervisory employees who are represented by the Utility
Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, except   
55 Table of Contents   Notes to
Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   certain engineering and laboratory employees who are represented
by the International Federation of Professional and Technical
Engineers, AFL-CIO. The union agreements expire at the end of
2007.   Earnings Per ShareThe computations of basic
and diluted earnings per share are noted below. Basic earnings
per share are computed by dividing net income available to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share
reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or
other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or
converted into common stock. Restricted Stock Awards are
included in the weighted stock outstanding as the shares have
all voting and dividend rights as issued and unrestricted common
stock.   Common stock options outstanding to purchase common shares were
90,500, 98,000, and 121,500 at December31, 2006, 2005, and
2004, respectively. Stock Appreciation Rights SAR covering
37,969shares of common stock were outstanding as of
December31, 2006, and none were outstanding as of
December31, 2005 or December31, 2004.   All options and most SARs are dilutive and the dilutive effect
is shown in the table below.

adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards
Boards FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No123 revised 2004 SFAS123R,
Share-Based Payment which replaced Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No123 SFAS123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and
supersedes APB Opinion No 25 APB25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees. Under the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS123R, stock-based
compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the
fair value of the award. The Company recognizes compensation as
expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
period, which is the vesting period. The Company elected the
modified-prospective method of adoption of
SFASNo123R, under which prior periods are not
revised for comparative purposes. Using this method, the
valuation provisions of SFAS123R apply to new grants and
the unvested portion of prior grants on a prospective basis. All
options that were granted prior to the adoption date were vested
as of the adoption date such that no compensation expense is
required.   Prior to the adoption of SFAS123R, the Company presented
all tax benefits for deductions resulting from the exercise of
stock options and disqualifying dispositions as operating cash
flows on its consolidated statement of cash flows.
SFAS123R requires the benefits of tax deductions in
excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a
financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow. This
requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase
net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. Total cash
flow will remain unchanged from what would have been reported
under prior accounting rules.   The adoption of SFAS123R did not have a material impact
on the Companys consolidated financial position, results
of operations and cash flows. See Note13 for further
information regarding the Companys stock-based
compensation assumptions and expenses.   Long-Term Incentive PlanThe Company had a
stockholder-approved Long-Term Incentive Plan which was
replaced on April27, 2005, by a stockholder-approved
Equity Incentive Plan that allowed granting of non   
56 Table of Contents   Notes to
Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   qualified stock options. The Company accounted for options
issued under the Long-Term Incentive Plan using the intrinsic
value method of accounting as prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees. All outstanding options issued under
the Long-Term Incentive Plan have an exercise price equal to the
market price on the date they were granted. All options granted
under the Long-Term Incentive Plan are fully vested. No
compensation expense was recorded in 2006, 2005 or 2004, related
to stock options issued under the Long-Term Incentive Plan.   The table below illustrates the effect on net income and
earnings per share as if the Company had applied the fair value
recognition provision of SFASNo123 to employee
compensation for the options granted under the Long-Term
Incentive Plan.

147     146   Other Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn
November 2004, the FASB issued SFASNo151,
Inventory Costs an Amendment to ARB
No43, Chapter4. The statement clarifies the
accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs, and wasted material. The adoption of
this statement in the first quarter of 2006 did not have a
material impact the Companys financial position, results
of operations, or cash flows.   In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
FIN48. FIN48 clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the entitys
financial statements. FIN48 prescribes a comprehensive
model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and
disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions
that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return.
FIN48 is effective for year beginning after
December16, 2006. The Company does not anticipate the
adoption of FIN48 will have a material effect on the
Companys financial statements upon adoption.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo158,
Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans an Amendment of FASB
Statements No87, 88, 106, and 132R. The statement
requires an employer to recognize in its statement of financial
position an asset for a plans over-funded status or a
liability for a plans under-funded status. The measurement
date of the plans assets and obligations that determine
the funded status will be as of the end of the employers
fiscal year effective in 2008. The adoption of this statement is
described in Note12.   In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
Staff Accounting BulletinNo108, Considering the
Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements
SAB108. The bulletin was issued to address diversity in
practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements and
the potential under current practice for the build up of
improper amounts on the balance sheet. The adoption of
SAB108 did not have a material impact on the
Companys financial statements.

or a flat-rate amount per month. Leases have been entered into
with telecommunications companies for cellular phone antennas
placed on the Companys property. Design and construction
services are for the design and installation of water mains and
other water infrastructure for others outside the Companys
regulated service areas.

ACQUISITIONS   In 2006, after receiving regulatory approval, the Companys
wholly-owned subsidiary, New Mexico Water, acquired a water
system by purchasing the assets of the system for a purchase
price of approximately $500 which was allowed as the rate base
of the system   In 2005, after receiving regulatory approval, the Companys
subsidiaries acquired three water systems for a combined
purchase price of $807, including liabilities assumed of $336,
which was the approximate value of the rate base in aggregate of
the assets acquired.   In 2004, after receiving regulatory approval, New Mexico Water,
acquired the stock of National Utilities Corporation. The
purchase was for $900 which was the approximate amount of rate
base of the assets acquired and for certain real estate used by
the water system.   Condensed balance sheets and pro forma results of operations for
these acquisitions have not been presented since the impact of
the purchases was not material. Minimal or no goodwill was
recorded in connection with the acquisitions.

PREFERRED
STOCK   As of December31, 2006 and 2005, 380,000shares of
preferred stock were authorized. Dividends on outstanding shares
are payable quarterly at a fixed rate before any dividends can
be paid on common stock.   The outstanding 139,000shares of $25par value
cumulative, 44% SeriesC preferred shares are not
convertible to common stock. A premium of $243 would be due to
preferred stock shareholders upon voluntary liquidation of
SeriesC. There is no premium in the event of an
involuntary liquidation. Each SeriesC preferred share is
entitled to sixteen votes, with the right to cumulative votes at
any election of directors.   See Note7 for a description of the SeriesD preferred
Stock.

COMMON
STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY   The Company is authorized to issue 25million shares of
$001par value common stock. As of December31, 2006
and 2005, 20,656,699shares and 18,389,996shares,
respectively, of common stock were issued and outstanding. In
2006, the Company completed an offering of 2,250,000shares
at $3675per share, raising approximately $83million
in gross proceeds.   Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Repurchase
PlanThe Company has a Dividend Reinvestment and
Stock Purchase Plan Plan. Under the Plan, stockholders may
reinvest dividends to purchase additional Company common stock
without commission fees. The Plan also allows existing
stockholders and other interested investors to purchase Company
common stock through the transfer agent up to certain limits.
The Companys transfer agent operates the Plan and
purchases shares on the open market to provide shares for the
Plan.   Stockholder Rights PlanThe Companys
Stockholder Rights Plan Plan is designed to protect
stockholders and to maximize stockholder value by encouraging a
prospective acquirer to negotiate with the Board. The Plan was
adopted in 1998 and authorized a dividend distribution of one
right Right to purchase 1/100thshare of SeriesD   
59 Table of Contents   Notes to
Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   Preferred Stock for each outstanding share of Common Stock in
certain circumstances. The Rights are for a ten-year period that
expires in February 2008.   Each Right represents a right to purchase 1/100thshare of
SeriesD Preferred Stock at the price of $120, subject to
adjustment Purchase Price. Each share of SeriesD
Preferred Stock is entitled to receive a dividend equal to 100
times any dividend paid on common stock and 100 votes per share
in any stockholder election. The Rights become exercisable upon
occurrence of a Distribution Date. A Distribution Date event
occurs if aany person accumulates 15% of the then
outstanding Common Stock, bany person presents a tender
offer which would cause the persons ownership level to
exceed 15% and the Board determines the tender offer not to be
fair to the Companys stockholders, or cthe Board
determines that a stockholder maintaining a 10% interest in the
Common Stock could have an adverse impact on the Company or
could attempt to pressure the Company to repurchase the
holders shares at a premium.   Until the occurrence of a Distribution Date, each Right trades
with the Common Stock and is not separately transferable. When a
Distribution Date occurs: athe Company would distribute
separate Rights Certificates to Common Stockholders and the
Rights would subsequently trade separate from the Common Stock;
and beach holder of a Right, other than the acquiring
person whose Rights would thereafter be void, would have the
right to receive upon exercise at its then current Purchase
Price that number of shares of Common Stock having a market
value of two times the Purchase Price of the Right. If the
Company merges into the acquiring person or enters into any
transaction that unfairly favors the acquiring person or
disfavors the Companys other stockholders, the Right
becomes a right to purchase Common Stock of the acquiring person
having a market value of two times the Purchase Price.   The Board may determine that in certain circumstances a proposal
that would cause a Distribution Date is in the Company
stockholders best interest. Therefore, the Board may, at
its option, redeem the Rights at a redemption price of
$0001per Right.

SHORT-TERM
BORROWINGS   At December31, 2006, the Company maintained a bank line of
credit providing unsecured borrowings of up to $10million
at the prime lending rate, which was 75% at December31,
2006, or lower rates as quoted by the bank. Cal Water maintained
a separate bank line of credit for an additional
$45million on the same terms as the Companys line of
credit. Both agreements required a
30-day
out-of-debt
period during any 24 consecutive months. The $10million
and $45million lines have a requirement where the
outstanding balance must be below $10million and
$5million, respectively, for a
30-day
consecutive period during any
12-month
period. Both agreements have a covenant requiring debt as a
percentage of total capitalization to be less than 67%. At
December31, 2006, there were no borrowings on the Company
or Cal Water lines of credit.   The following table represents borrowings under the bank lines

flow-through accounting for Federal depreciation expense on
assets acquired prior to 1982 and retirement costs of such
assets. For assets acquired prior to 1982, the benefit of excess
tax depreciation was previously passed through to the
ratepayers. The tax benefit is now reversing and a higher tax
expense is being recognized and is included in customer rates.
Offsetting the flow-through depreciation in 2006 was the impact
of cost to remove
pre-1982
assets. Also included is the federal income tax deduction from
qualified U.S.production activities, which is being phased
in from 2005 through 2010. Under the Act, qualified production
activities include production of potable water, but exclude the
transmission and distribution of the potable water. The impact
of the deduction is being reported in the year in which the
deduction

EMPLOYEE
BENEFIT PLANS   Savings PlanThe Company sponsors a 401k
qualified, defined contribution savings plan that allows
participants to contribute up to 20% of pre-tax compensation.
The Company matches fifty cents for each dollar contributed by
the employee up to a maximum Company match of 40%. Company
contributions were $1,628, $1,498, and $1,443, for the years
2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.   Pension PlansThe Company provides a
qualified, defined-benefit, non-contributory pension plan for
substantially all employees. The accumulated benefit obligations
of the pension plan are $77,079 and $71,463   
63 Table of Contents   Notes to
Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   as of December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The fair
value of pension plan assets was $78,393 and $70,225 as of
December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.   Plan assets in the defined-benefit pension plan as of
December31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows   	
Asset Category   Target   2006   2005   Bond Funds
35% to 45%
402   364   Equity Accounts
55% to 65%
598   636   The investment objective of the fund is to maximize the return
on assets, commensurate with the risk the Company Trustees deem
appropriate to meet the obligations of the Plan, minimize the
volatility of the pension expense, and account for
contingencies. The Trustees utilize the services of an outside
investment advisor and periodically measure fund performance
against specific indexes in an effort to generate a rate of
return for the total portfolio that equals or exceeds the
actuarial investment rate assumptions.   Pension payment obligations are generally funded by the purchase
of an annuity from a life insurance company. If monthly benefits
are paid to future retirees, rather than with a purchase of an
annuity, payments are expected to be made in each year from 2007
to 2011 are $1,234, $1,683, $2,285, $2,830 and $3,550,
respectively. The aggregate benefits expected to be paid in the
five years 2012 through 2016 would be $31,245. If annuities are
purchased for the retirees rather than making monthly payments,
the payments for the same period would be approximately, $3,764,
$5,160, $7,151, $6,817 and $8,947. The aggregate payments to be
paid for annuities in the five years 2012 through 2016 would be
approximately $55,571. The expected benefit payments are based
upon the same assumptions used to measure the Companys
benefit obligation at December31, 2006, and include
estimated future employee service.   The Company also maintains unfunded, non-qualified, supplemental
executive retirement plan. The unfunded supplemental executive
retirement plan accumulated benefit obligations were $10,104 and
$8,608 as of December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Benefit payments under the supplemental executive retirement
plan are paid currently and are included in the preceding
paragraph.   The costs of the pension and retirement plans are charged to
expense and utility plant. The Company makes annual
contributions to fund the amounts accrued for pension cost.   Other Postretirement PlanThe Company provides
substantially all active, permanent employees with medical,
dental, and vision benefits through a self-insured plan.
Employees retiring at or after age58, along with their
spouses and dependents, continue participation in the plan by
payment of a premium. Plan assets are invested in mutual funds,
short-term money market instruments and commercial paper based
upon the same asset mix as the pension plan. Retired employees
are also provided with a $5,000 life insurance benefit.   The Company records the costs of postretirement benefits other
than pension during the employees years of active service.
Postretirement benefit expense recorded in 2006, 2005, and 2004,
was $2,369, $1,572, and $1,420, respectively. The Company has
recorded a regulatory asset in prior years for the difference
between the Company-funded amount and the net periodic benefit
cost. Prior to the adoption of SFASNo158, the
remaining net periodic benefit cost as of December31,
2006, was $9,791 and is expected to be recovered through future
customer rates and is recorded as a regulatory asset. The
expected benefit payments, net of retiree premiums and medicare
partD subsidies, for the next five years are $840, $933,
$1,050, $1,139 and $1,232, respectively.

STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION PLANS   The Company has two stockholder-approved stock-based
compensation plans.   Long-term Incentive PlanUnder the Long-Term
Incentive Plan that allowed granting of nonqualified stock
options, some of which are currently outstanding, there will be
no future grants made. Options were granted at an exercise price
that was not less than the per share common stock market price
on the date of grant. The options vest at a 25% rate on their
anniversary date over their first four years and are exercisable
over a ten-year period. At December31, 2006, 90,500
options are fully vested and exercisable at a weighted average
price of $2494. The intrinsic value of the vested shares at
December31, 2006 was $1,400 and the weighted average fair
value at date of

Plan, which was approved by shareholders in April 2005, is
authorized to issue up to 1,000,000shares of common stock.
In 2006, the Company granted Restricted Stock Awards RSAs of
9,467shares of common stock both to employees and to
directors of the Company. Employee awards vest ratably over
48months, while independent director awards vest at the
end of 12months. The shares were valued based upon the
fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date
of grant. During 2006, 5,065shares became vested,
264shares were forfeited and as of December31, 2006,
4,138 invested shares are outstanding. In 2006, Stock
Appreciation Rights SARs equivalent to 40,000shares were
granted to employees, which vest ratably over 48months and
expire at the end of 10years. The grant-date fair value
for SARs was determined by using the Black Scholes model, which
arrived at a fair value of $773per share. Upon exercise
of a SAR, the appreciation is payable in common shares of the
Company.   The assumptions utilized were   	
2006   Expected dividend yield
299     Expected volatility
219     Risk-free interest rate
419     Expected holding period in years
60   The Company did not apply a forfeiture rate in the expense
computation relating to SARs and RSAs issued to employees as
they vest monthly and, as a result, the expense is recorded for
actual number vested during the period. For outside directors,
the Company did not apply a forfeiture rate in the expense
computation relating to RSAs, as the Company expects 100% to
vest at the end of twelve months.

FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   For those financial instruments for which it is practicable to
estimate a fair value, the following methods and assumptions
were used. For cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
accounts payable, the carrying amount approximates the fair
value because of the short-term maturity of the instruments. The
fair value of the Companys long-term debt is estimated at
$316 million and $289million as of December31, 2006
and 2005, respectively, using a discounted cash flow analysis,
based on the current rates available to the Company for debt of
similar maturities. The book value of the long-term debt is
$292million and $274million as of December31,
2006 and 2005, respectively. The fair value of advances for
construction contracts is estimated at $59million as of
December31, 2006, and $57million as of
December31, 2005, based on data provided by brokers who
purchase and sell these contracts.

leases was $666 in 2006, $682 in 2005, and $632 in 2004.   The Company has a long-term contract with the SantaClara
Water District that requires the Company to purchase minimum
annual water quantities. Purchases are priced at the districts
then-current wholesale water rate. The Company operates to
purchase sufficient water to equal or exceed the minimum
quantities under the contract. The total paid under the contract
was $5,361 in 2006, $4,763 in 2005, and $4,610 in 2004.   The Company leases the City of Hawthorne water system, which in
addition to the upfront lease payment, includes an annual
payment. The
15-year
lease expires in 2011. There were annual payments of $116 in
2006, 2005   
69 Table of Contents   Notes to
Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   and 2004. In July 2003 the Company negotiated a
15-year
lease of the City of Commerce water system. The lease includes
an annual lease payment of $845per year plus a cost
savings sharing arrangement.   The Company also has a water supply contract with Stockton East
Water District SEWD that requires a fixed, annual payment and
does not vary during the year with the quantity of water
delivered by the district. Because of the fixed price
arrangement, the Company operates to receive as much water as
possible from SEWD in order to minimize the cost of operating
Company-owned wells used to supplement SEWD deliveries. The
total paid under the contract was $4,420 in 2006, $4,300 in
2005, and $4,392 in 2004. Pricing under the contract varies
annually.   Estimated annual contractual obligations in the table above are
based on the same payment levels as 2005. Future increased costs
by SEWD are expected to be offset by a decline in the allocation
of costs to the Company, as other customers of SEWD are expected
to receive a larger allocation based upon growth of their
service areas.   On September21, 2005, the Company entered into an
agreement with Kern County Water Agency to obtain treated water
for the Companys operations. The term of the agreement is
to January1, 2035, or until the repayment of the
Agencys bonds described hereafter occurs. Under the
terms of the agreement, the Company is obligated to purchase
20,500acre feet of treated water per year. The Company is
obligated to pay the Capital Facilities Charge and the Treated
Water Charge regardless of whether it can use the water in its
operation, and is obligated for these charges even if the Agency
cannot produce an adequate amount to supply the 20,500acre
feet in the year. This agreement supersedes a prior agreement
with Kern County Water Agency for the supply of 11,500acre
feet of water per year. Total paid, under the prior agreement,
was $3,301 in 2006, $3,288 in 2005, and $3,308 in 2004.   Three other parties, including the City of Bakersfield, are also
obligated to purchase a total of 32,500acre feet per year
under separate agreements with the Agency. Further, the Agency
has the right to proportionally reduce the water supply provided
to all of the participants if it cannot produce adequate
supplies. The participation of all parties in the transaction
for expansion of the Agencys facilities, including the
Water Purification Plant, purchase of the water, and payment of
interest and principal on the bonds being issued by the Agency
to finance the transaction is required as a condition to the
obligation of the Agency to proceed with expansion of the
Agencys facilities. If any of the other parties does not
use its allocation, that party is obligated to pay its
contracted amount.   The Agency is planning to issue bonds to fund the project and
will use the payments of the Capital Facilities Charges by the
Company and the other contracted parties to meet the
Agencys obligations to pay interest and repay principal on
the bonds. If any of the parties were to default on making
payments of the Capital Facilities Charge, then the other
parties are obligated to pay for the defaulting partys
share on a pro-rata basis. If there is a payment default by a
party and the remaining parties have to make payments, they are
also entitled to a pro-rata share of the defaulting partys
water allocation.   The Company expects to use all its contracted amount of water in
its operations every year. In addition, if the Company were to
pay for and receive additional amounts of water due to a default
of another participating party; the Company believes it could
use this additional water in its operations without incurring
substantial incremental cost increases. If additional treated
water is available, all parties have an option to purchase this
additional treated water, subject to the Agencys right to
allocate the water among the parties.   The total obligation of all parties, excluding the Company, is
approximately $50million to the Agency. Based on the
credit worthiness of the other participants, which are
government entities, it is believed to be highly unlikely that
the Company would be required to assume any other parties
obligations under the contract due to their default. In the
event of default by a party, the Company would receive
entitlement to the additional water for assuming any obligation.   Once the project is complete, the Company is obligated to pay a
Capital Facilities Charge and a Treated Water Charge that
together total $4,700 annually, which equates to $023per
acre foot. Annual payments of $2,000 for the Capital Facilities
Charge will begin when the Agency issues bonds to fund the
project. Some of the Treated Water Charge of $2,700 is expected
to begin July1, 2007, when a portion of the planned
capacity is expected to be available. The expanded water
treatment plant is expected to be at full capacity by fall 2009,
and at that time, the full annual payments of $4,739 would be
made and continue through the term of the agreement. Once
treated water is   
70 Table of Contents   Notes to
Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   being delivered, the Company will also be obligated for its
portion of the operating costs; that portion is currently
estimated to be $007per acre foot. The actual amount will
vary due to variations from reimbursable operating cost
estimates, inflation, and other changes in the cost structure.
The Companys overall estimated cost of $03per acre
foot is less than the estimated cost of procuring untreated
water assuming water rights could be obtained and then
providing treatment.   ContingenciesIn 1995, the State of
Californias Department of Toxic Substances Control DTSC
named us as a potential responsible party for cleanup of a toxic
contamination plume in the Chico groundwater. The toxic spill
occurred when cleaning solvents, which were discharged into the
citys sewer system by local dry cleaners, leaked into the
underground water supply. The DTSC contends that our
responsibility stems from our operation of wells in the
surrounding vicinity that caused the contamination plume to
spread. While we are cooperating with the clean up, we deny any
responsibility for the contamination or the resulting cleanup.   In December 2002, we were named along with other defendants in
two lawsuits filed by DTSC for the cleanup of the plume. The
suits assert that the defendants are jointly and severally
liable for the estimated cleanup of $8,700. The parties have
undertaken settlement negotiations. If the parties finalize a
written settlement agreement, it must then be approved by the
court. In connection with these suits, our insurance carrier has
filed a separate lawsuit against us for reimbursement of past
defense costs which approximate $1,000. We believe that the
insurance carrier has a duty to defend and is not entitled to
any defense cost reimbursement. Furthermore, we believe that
insurance coverage exists for this claim. Consequently, we have
filed a number of pre-trial motions to dismiss the lawsuit.
However, if our claim is ultimately found to be excludable under
insurance policies, we may have to pay damages. We can give no
assurance that we will be able to recover amounts paid for
damages through rates.   In December of 2006, Cal Water filed an application to allow it
to recover additional funding associated with its postretirement
benefit other than pensions PBOP or retiree healthcare plan
that has been recorded as a regulatory asset. As of
December31, 2006, the regulatory asset was approximately
$98million. In February 2007, the Division of Rate Payer
Advocates DRA filed its protest to our PBOP application. The
DRA further noted that prior to their protest, the parties met
several times to discuss the Companys application. During
the discussions it became apparent to the DRA that negotiations
would extend beyond the deadline for filing their protest. The
DRA further noted that subsequent to this filing, the parties
will continue their discussions to achieve a settlement that is
reasonable, consistent with the law, and in the public interest.
While the DRA has filed its protest, the ultimate outcome will
be determined by the CPUC. Cal Water believes that the CPUC will
recognize in rates the recovery of the regulatory asset and the
additional funding of the plan. If the CPUC does not permit the
Company to recover the full amount of its regulatory asset, the
regulatory asset, to the extent not allowed in recovery, will be
written off.   The Company is involved in other proceedings or litigation
arising in the ordinary course of operations. The Company
believes the ultimate resolution of such matters will not
materially affect its financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

Controls
and Procedures   Attached as exhibits to this
Form10-K
are certifications of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and
Chief Financial Officer CFO, which are required in accordance
with
Rule13a-14
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This
Controls and Procedures section includes information
concerning the controls and controls evaluation referred to in
the certifications.   Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures Disclosure Controls as of the
December31, 2006. The controls evaluation was conducted
under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including our CEO and CFO. Disclosure Controls are controls and
procedures designed to reasonably assure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange
Act, such as this
Form10-K,
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure
Controls are also designed to reasonably assure that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our quarterly
evaluation of Disclosure Controls includes an evaluation of some
components of our internal control over financial reporting, and
internal control over financial reporting is also separately
evaluated on an annual basis for purposes of providing the
management report, which is set forth below.   Based on the controls evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded
that, as of the end of the period covered by this
Form10-K,
our Disclosure Controls were effective to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed in our
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported within the time periods specified by the SEC, and that
material information related to us and our subsidiaries is made
known to management, including the CEO and CFO, particularly
during the period when our periodic reports are being prepared.   Management
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to
the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our
assets; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of our management and
directors; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.   Management assessed our internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2006, the end of our fiscal
year. Management based its assessment on criteria established by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. Managements assessment included
evaluation of elements such as the design and operating
effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process
documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control
environment.   Based on our assessment, management has concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external reporting
purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. In addition, on a quarterly basis we evaluate any
changes to our internal control over financial reporting to
determine if material changes occurred.   
73 Table of Contents   Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP,
audited managements assessment and independently assessed
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting. KPMG has issued an attestation report concurring with
managements assessment, which is included at the end of
PartII, Item8 of this
Form10-K.   There was no change in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended December31, 2006, that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls   Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that
our Disclosure Controls or our internal control over financial
reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A
control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
control systems objectives will be met. The design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error
or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances
of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in
part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls
effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time,
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or
procedures.
