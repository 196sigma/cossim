To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Performance Technologies, Incorporated We have completed integrated audits of Performance Technologies, Incorporated
2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 and an audit of its 2003
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our
audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
- 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Performance Technologies, Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2005
and December 31, 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Internal control over financial reporting
- 
Also, in our opinion, management assessment, included in Management Annual
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A,
that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Company management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express opinions on management assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; ii
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

and Data Connection Limited, comprised 21% and 12% of sales, respectively. In
2004, two customers, Lucent Technologies, Inc. and UTStarcom, Inc., comprised
13% and 11% of sales, respectively. In 2003, two customers, Andrew Corporation
and UTStarcom, Inc., comprised 17% and 16% of sales, respectively. During these
years, Lucent Technologies, Inc. purchased switching products, Data Connection
Limited and UTStarcom, Inc. purchased computing products and Andrew Corporation
purchased communications and switching products.
Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Investments in which
the Company owns 20% to 50% of the voting stock and exercises significant
influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for using the
equity method of accounting. The consolidated financial statements include the
operating results of Mapletree Networks, Inc., from its date of acquisition
Note B. All significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated. In
February 2006, the Company established Performance Technologies, Inc. - Korea, a
subsidiary located in South Korea.
Foreign Currency Translation: The US dollar is the functional currency of the
Company Canadian subsidiary. Monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at
year-end exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at
historical rates. Revenues, expenses, gains and losses are remeasured using the
rates on which those elements were recognized during the period.
Use of Estimates: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at year-end and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Concentration of Credit Risk: Financial instruments that potentially expose the
Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of bank
deposits, investments, and accounts receivable. Investments consist of high
quality, interest bearing financial instruments. The Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and maintains an
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon the expected
collectability of all accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2005, Lucent
Technologies, Inc. comprised 16% of net accounts receivable and Data Connection
Limited represented 10% of net accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2004,
Lucent Technologies, Inc. comprised 31% of net accounts receivable.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The carrying amounts of the Company
financial instruments, including investments, accounts receivable and accounts
payable approximate fair values at December 31, 2005 and 2004, as the maturity
of these instruments are generally short term.
Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased
with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Investments: Investments consist of auction rate municipal debt securities
classified as available-for-sale. These investments are recorded at cost, which
approximates fair market value due to their variable interest rates. These
investments typically reset on approximately a monthly basis, and despite the
long-term nature of their stated contractual maturities, the Company has the
ability to quickly liquidate these securities. All income generated from these
investments was recorded as interest income. These investments are on deposit
with major financial institutions.
Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the
first-in, first-out method. The Company records provisions for excess, obsolete
or slow moving inventory based on changes in customer demand, technology
developments or other economic factors.
Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales in
accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue
Recognition. Product sales represent the majority of the Company revenue and
include hardware products and hardware products with embedded software. The
Company recognizes revenue from these product sales when persuasive evidence of
an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been provided, the
sale price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.
Additionally, the Company sells its products on terms which transfer title and
risk of loss at a specified location, typically shipping point. Accordingly,
revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all factors are met,
including transfer of title and risk of loss, which typically occurs upon
shipment by the Company. If these conditions are not met, the Company will defer
revenue recognition until such time these conditions have been satisfied.
Revenue earned from arrangements for software is accounted for under the
provisions of Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition and
EITF Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Revenue
from software requiring significant production, modification, or customization
is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting. Any
anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as such losses
are determined. If all conditions of revenue recognition are not met, the
Company defers revenue recognition and will recognize revenue when the Company
has fulfilled its obligations under the arrangement. Revenue from software
maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the contractual period.
Revenue from consulting and other services is recognized at the time the
services are rendered. The Company also sells certain products through
distributors who are granted limited rights of return. Potential returns are
accounted for at the time of sale.
Property, Equipment and Improvements: Property, equipment and improvements are
stated at cost. Depreciation of equipment and improvements is provided for using
the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives  Engineering equipment and software  3 - 5 years
Manufacturing equipment       3 - 5 years
Furniture and equipment       3 - 5 years
Leasehold improvements        the lesser of 10 years or the lease term
Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Asset betterments are
capitalized.
Long-Lived Assets: The Company regularly assesses all of its long-lived assets
for impairment when events or circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may
not be recoverable, in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.
Research and Development: Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred.
Shipping and Handling Costs: Amounts charged to customers and costs incurred by
the Company related to shipping and handling are included in net sales and cost
of goods sold, respectively, in accordance with EITF Issue No. 00-10,
Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs.
Advertising: Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in Selling
and marketing in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Advertising expense
amounted to $82,000, $66,000 and $173,000 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Software Development Costs: On a product-by-product basis, software development
costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility and
prior to general release of the product are capitalized and amortized commencing
after general release over its estimated remaining economic life, generally
three years, or using the ratio of current revenues to current and anticipated
revenues from such software, whichever provides greater amortization.
Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and
liability approach, which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and
assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts and the tax basis of such assets and liabilities. This
method utilizes enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the
temporary differences are expected to reverse and gives immediate effect to
changes in income tax rates upon enactment. Deferred tax assets are recognized,
net of any valuation allowance, for deductible temporary differences and tax
credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax provision benefit represents the
change in net deferred tax asset and liability balances.
Earnings Per Share: Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
Diluted earnings per share calculations reflect the assumed exercise and
conversion of dilutive employee stock options and unvested restricted stock,
applying the treasury stock method. Diluted earnings per share calculations
exclude the effect of approximately 1,098,000, 1,305,000 and 660,000 options in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, since such options have an exercise price in
excess of the average market price of the Company common stock.
Stock-Based Employee Compensation: At December 31, 2005, the Company had stock
options outstanding from three stock-based employee compensation plans. The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the recognition and
measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations. Accordingly, no stock-based employee
compensation cost has been recognized in net income for the stock options
granted. On March 25, 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of 408,285 stock
options whose exercise prices were greater than $1511 to be fully vested on
that date. This acceleration resulted in $997,000 of pro forma compensation
expense, determined under the fair value method, being recorded in 2005 that
would have otherwise been recorded in 2006. As a result of the acceleration, the
Company expects to reduce its exposure to the effects of SFAS No. 123 Revised,
Share-Based Payment. Had compensation cost for the stock options granted been
determined based on the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company net income and earnings
per share would have been as follows                         Year Ended December 31,
2005      2004     2003
Net income, as reported        $ 3,045,000 $ 2,780,000 $ 3,050,000
Add: Restricted stock compensation
expense, net of tax            14,000    32,000    67,000
Deduct: Total stock-based
compensation expense determined
under fair value based method for
all awards, net of related tax
effects                2,609,000  2,757,000  1,457,000
Pro forma net income          $  450,000 $   55,000 $ 1,660,000
Earnings per share:
Basic - as reported          $    024 $    022 $    025
Basic - pro forma           $    003 $    000 $    014
Diluted - as reported         $    023 $    021 $    024
Diluted - pro forma          $    003 $    000 $    013
The assumptions regarding the annual vesting of stock options granted ranged
from one to six years in 2005, one to three years in 2004 and two to three years
in 2003. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in 2005, 2004 and 2003: Dividend yield of 0 expected volatility of 65% to 70%, 68% to 69%, and 67%; risk-free interest rates
of 33% to 46%, 21% to 35%, and 20%; and expected lives of ranging from one
to six years in 2005, one to three years in 2004, and two to three years in
2003. The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2005, 2004 and
2003 was $384, $757 and $196, respectively.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements: In December 2004, SFAS No. 123 Revised 2004
Share-Based Payment was issued. This statement establishes standards for the
accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments
for goods or services. This statement requires an entity to measure the cost of
employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, based
on the fair value of the award at the grant date. That cost will be recognized
over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in
exchange for the award. This new pronouncement is effective for the Company
beginning January 1, 2006. As of the required effective date, all entities that
used the fair value-based method for either recognition or disclosure under SFAS
No. 123 may apply this statement using a modified version of prospective
application. Under this method, compensation cost is recognized for the portion
of outstanding stock-based awards for which the requisite service has not yet
been rendered. Upon adoption, the Company will apply the modified version of
prospective application. In 2006, under this standard, the Company expects to
record stock option compensation expense of approximately $2 million related to
stock options outstanding at December 31, 2005. This amount excludes stock
option compensation expense for any stock options that may be granted in 2006.
To date, the Company has not granted any stock options in 2006.
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs - An Amendment
of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 states that abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material spoilage should
be recognized as current-period charges. Additionally, SFAS No. 151 requires
that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be
based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The Company is
required to adopt SFAS No. 151 effective January 1, 2006. The Company does not
expect the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will have a material impact on its
consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections, which replaces APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS
No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS No.
154 changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in
accounting principle. Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 154, beginning January 1,
2006, the Company will apply the standard guidance to changes in accounting
methods, as required. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 154
will have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and
financial condition.
Note B - Acquisition
On January 23, 2004, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and
assumed certain liabilities of Mapletree Networks, Inc., a company that provided
voice, data and fax processing technology to original equipment manufacturers.
The products acquired in this acquisition broaden the Company product offering
to its customers.
In accordance with the purchase agreement, the Company paid $6,625,000 at
closing and incurred $418,000 of other acquisition related costs. The Company
accounted for the acquisition under the provisions of SFAS No. 141, Business
Combinations. As a component of the acquisition, the Company acquired certain
software development costs which amounted to $577,000 at the date of
acquisition. The Company also acquired certain net assets which amounted to
$574,000 and were comprised principally of accounts receivable, inventory,
accounts payable, accrued expenses and acquired in-process research and
development related to certain voice processing products that amounted to
$218,000 and was charged to operations during the first quarter 2004. In
connection with the acquisition, the Company agreed to pay an additional
$1,625,000 if the operations of the acquired group operated by the Company on a
stand-alone basis achieved certain milestones earn-out. Based upon the
operating results of the acquired group in the second quarter of 2004, the
earn-out was terminated.
During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company resolved certain matters related
to the acquisition resulting in a payment to the Company of $1,749,000, which
represented a partial return of purchase price and was recorded as a reduction
of goodwill. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net
assets acquired, which totaled $4,143,000, is included in goodwill on the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and is deductible for tax purposes.
Operating results of the acquired group have been included in the Consolidated
Statements of Income from the date of acquisition.
Note C - Investments
At December 31, 2005 and 2004, investments consisted of high grade, auction rate
municipal securities which the Company has classified as available-for-sale. The
maturities of the investments held at December 31, 2005 all exceeded five years.
These investments are recorded at cost, which approximates fair market value due
to their variable interest rates. These investments typically reset on
approximately a monthly basis, and despite the long-term nature of their stated
contractual maturities, the Company has the ability to quickly liquidate these
securities. All income generated from these investments was recorded as interest
income.

Note G - Investments in Unconsolidated Companies
As of January 1, 2003, the Company had invested $1,500,000 for a 47% ownership
interest in Momentum Computer, Inc. Momentum, a developer of specialized
single board computer products for the data communications, telecom, military
and aerospace markets. The investment was accounted for under the equity method.
Accordingly, the Company recorded its investment as an investment in
unconsolidated company and its share of Momentum earnings or loss as Equity
in income loss of unconsolidated company on the Consolidated Statements of
Income. As of December 31, 2003, the Company also had a note receivable from
Momentum in the amount of $1,000,000.
During 2003, the Company reduced its ownership in Momentum from 47% to 30% when
the Company sold a portion of its investment back to the majority stockholder of
Momentum for $250,000. Based upon the Company expectations of Momentum
performance at the time of the investment and its business prospects late in
2003, the Company concluded that an other than temporary impairment of this
investment occurred in 2003. Based upon this conclusion, the Company recorded an
impairment charge of $392,000 on its investment and reduced the carrying value
of the investment to the Company estimate of fair value at December 31, 2003.
During the third quarter 2004, the Company completed the sale of its entire
remaining investment in Momentum for $2,087,000 and realized a gain of
$1,169,000, after taxes of $335,000. Cash received in the fourth quarter 2004
from the sale amounted to $3,087,000, including the collection of the $1,000,000
note receivable.
Momentum financial position and results of operations were as follows                    For the period from
January 1, 2004 to the
date of sale    For the year ended

Long term borrowings        1,530,000
Equity              $1,069,000
On February 18, 2004, the Company entered into an agreement to invest up to
$3,000,000 in InSciTek Microsystems, Inc. InSciTek, an unrelated company, in
the form of an interest bearing convertible note. During 2004, the Company
invested $3,000,000 in conjunction with this agreement including committed
funding of $350,000 in January 2005. As of December 31, 2004, InSciTek had not
raised sufficient outside capital to assure its future as a going concern.
Therefore, during the fourth quarter 2004, the Company recorded a valuation
charge related to this note receivable in the amount of $3,000,000 as collection
of this note was doubtful. Under the original terms of the note, the Company had
the option to acquire ownership of InSciTek during a future specified period.
The note bore interest at 10% annually and was convertible into shares of common
stock of InSciTek. All unpaid accrued interest and all outstanding principal on
the note was payable in full to the Company on December 31, 2008.
During the third quarter 2005, InSciTek received an investment from an outside
party through the sale of series A preferred stock. In connection with that
investment, the Company and InSciTek renegotiated the terms of the note. Under
the amended terms, the Company forfeited the option to acquire ownership of
InSciTek during a future specified period. In addition, all unpaid interest due
to the Company at the date of the investment, amounting to $248,000, was paid in
the form of series A preferred stock of InSciTek. The note is now convertible
into series 2 preferred stock of InSciTek. The Company may call or convert the
note in the future upon the occurrence of certain events. As of December 31,
2005, the collectability of this note continued to be doubtful and a full
reserve remained recorded.
Note H - Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned
to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill
is tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter and will be
tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances
change that more likely than not would indicate the carrying amount may be
impaired. An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying
amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The Company utilizes a
combination of quoted market prices and discounted cash flow analysis for its
impairment tests. See Note B for further discussion.
Note I - Accrued Expenses
Accrued expenses consisted of the following:

Total               $ 4,438,000     $ 3,916,000
The Company has warranty obligations in connection with the sale of certain of
its products. The warranty period for its products is generally one year. The
costs incurred to provide for these warranty obligations are estimated and
recorded as an accrued liability at the time of sale. The Company estimates its
future warranty costs based on product-based historical performance rates and
related costs to repair. The changes in the Company accrued warranty
obligations for 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows     Accrued warranty obligations at January 1, 2003    $  82,000

and 2003, respectively.
Note K - Revolving Credit Agreement
On January 5, 2006, the Company executed a Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. the Bank effective December 30, 2005. Under the terms of the
Credit Agreement, the Company may borrow, from time to time, up to an aggregate
of $5,000,000 from the Bank. The borrowings bear interest at various rates based
upon the type of borrowing, as defined in the agreement. The Credit Agreement
includes certain financial and administrative covenants. The Credit Agreement
terminates on December 29, 2006 at which time any outstanding borrowings must be
repaid. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility at December 31,
2005.
Note L - Stockholders' Equity
In August 2002, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of one million
shares of the Company common stock. The Company repurchased 56,350 shares at a
total cost of $194,000 under this program in 2003. This program expired in April
2003.
On July 11, 2005, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase
shares of its common stock for an aggregate amount not to exceed $10,000,000.
Under this program, shares of the Company common stock may be repurchased
through open market or private transactions, including block purchases, through
July 2006. Repurchased shares will be used for the Company stock option plans,
potential acquisition initiatives and general corporate purposes. There have
been no repurchases of shares under this program.
Note M - Stock Option Plan
In May 2001, the stockholders approved the 2001 Stock Option Plan pursuant to
which 1,500,000 shares of common stock were reserved for grant. The 2001 Stock
Option Plan replaced the 1986 plan which expired on December 31, 2001. In June
2003, the stockholders approved the 2003 Omnibus Incentive Plan pursuant to
which 1,500,000 shares of common stock were reserved for future grants. Awards
under the 2003 Omnibus Incentive Plan may include stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock and other stock performance awards as
determined by the Board of Directors.
Stock options may be granted to any officer or employee at not less than the
fair market value at the date of grant not less than 110% of the fair market
value in the case of holders of more than 10% of the Company common stock.
Options granted under the plans generally expire between five and ten years
from the date of grant and vest in periods ranging from one to six years.
With respect to non-qualified options and incentive stock options that are
exercised and held for less than one year, the Company recognizes a tax benefit
upon exercise in an amount equal to the tax effect of the difference between the
option price and the fair market value of the common stock on the exercise date.
Tax benefits related to such stock option exercises are credited to additional
paid-in capital.

During 2005, the Company granted 225,000 options that are subject to accelerated
vesting based upon the achievement of certain Company milestones, as defined in
the option agreement.
At December 31, 2005, 1,019,383 options were available for future grant under
the two stock option plans.
During 2003, the Board of Directors granted 17,720 shares of restricted stock at
prices ranging from $689 to $1254. During 2003, 1,740 shares of restricted
stock were forfeited, without vesting. In January 2004, 10,524 shares vested and
were issued. The remaining shares vest in November 2006. The value of restricted
stock is charged to compensation expense over the vesting period of the grant.
Note N - Stockholder Rights Plan
On October 27, 2000, the Company Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder
Rights Plan. Under this plan, one preferred stock Purchase Right was distributed
as a dividend for each share of common stock held by the stockholders of record
as of the close of business of November 8, 2000. Until the occurrence of certain
events, the Rights are traded as a unit with the common stock. Each Right will
separate and entitle stockholders to buy stock upon the occurrence of certain
events generally related to the change of control of the Company as defined in
the Plan. The Rights become exercisable ten days after either 1 an Acquiring
Person acquires or commences a tender offer to acquire 15% or more of the
Company Common Stock, or 2 an Adverse Person has acquired 10% or more of
the Company common stock and the Board determines this person is likely to
cause pressure on the Company to enter into a transaction that is not in the
Company best long-term interest. All Rights not held by an Acquiring Person or
an Adverse Person become rights to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth
of one share of preferred stock at an initial exercise price of $110 per Right.
Each Right entitles the holder of that Right to purchase the equivalent of $220
worth of the Company common stock for $110. If after such an event the Company
merges, consolidates or engages in a similar transaction in which it does not
survive, each holder has a flip over right to buy discounted stock in the
surviving entity. The Company may redeem the Rights for $001 each. The Rights
Plan expires on November 1, 2010 or can be modified or terminated, at the option
of the Board of Directors.
Note O - Income Taxes
Pre-tax earnings and the provision benefit for income taxes consisted of the
following for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003                      2005     2004     2003
Pre-tax earnings:
United States            $ 2,555,000  $  946,000  $ 4,583,000
Outside United States          529,000    396,000    507,000
Total pre-tax earnings       $ 3,084,000  $ 1,342,000  $ 5,090,000
For the same periods, the provision benefit for income taxes was as follows                      2005     2004     2003
Current income tax provision benefit:

The deferred income tax assets and liabilities consist of the following                           At December 31,
2005      2004
Assets  Current:
Accrued vacation, payroll and other

Non-current:
State net operating losses           139,000     139,000
Total gross deferred tax assets      3,547,000    3,361,000
Valuation allowance             139,000    139,000

Other                      7,000     16,000
Total deferred tax liabilities     $ 1,274,000  $ 1,332,000
Net deferred tax asset         $ 2,134,000   $ 1,890,000
The total deferred tax assets and liabilities as presented in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows                          2005      2004
Net current deferred tax assets       $ 3,272,000   $ 3,088,000
Net long-term deferred tax liabilities    $ 1,138,000   $ 1,198,000
In 2003, the Company recorded an impairment charge related to an investment in
an unaffiliated company. The deferred tax asset on the cumulative losses and
impairment charge related to this investment equaled $297,000 as of December 31,
2003, which amount was fully offset by the establishment of a valuation
allowance of $297,000 in 2003. This investment was sold in 2004 and the
valuation allowance was reversed.
In 2004, the Company established a deferred tax asset related to a note
receivable valuation charge that the Company recorded. In order to realize the
full benefit of this deferred tax asset in the future, the Company may have to
generate capital gains for income tax purposes. In the event that the Company is
unable to generate sufficient capital gains, a valuation allowance against this
deferred tax asset may be required in the future.
In 2004 and 2005, the Company generated net operating losses in certain states
for income tax purposes, which expire through 2010. The deferred tax asset
associated with the net operating losses is $139,000, which amount is fully
offset by a valuation allowance of $139,000, as it is more likely than not that
the tax benefit of these losses will not be realized. During 2005, there was no
change in the total valuation allowance. In 2004, the total valuation allowance
decreased by $158,000. This reflects an increase attributable to the
establishment of the valuation allowance for the state net operating losses of
$139,000 and the reversal of the valuation allowance attributable to the
Company investment in an unaffiliated company of $297,000.
As of December 31, 2005, income considered to be permanently reinvested in the
Company Canadian subsidiary amounted to $6,326,000. No deferred taxes have
been provided on this income, as the Company does not plan to initiate any
action that would require the payment of U.S. income taxes. It is not
practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on
these undistributed earnings.
The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act was signed into law on
October 22, 2004. The Act provides for the repeal of the extraterritorial income
exclusion through reduced benefits in 2005 and 2006, with full repeal effective
for 2007 and allows a deduction for qualified domestic production activities
phased in over the years 2005 to 2009 and fully effective in 2010. Pursuant to
FASB guidance with respect to the deduction for qualified domestic production
activities, the deduction is treated as a special deduction as described in
SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. As such, the special deduction has
no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date.
Rather, the impact of this deduction is reported in the period in which the
deduction is claimed on the Company tax return. The Act also includes a
temporary incentive for U.S. companies to repatriate accumulated income earned
abroad. The Company did not repatriate funds in 2005 or 2004.
Note P - Research and Development
The Corporation incurred research and development costs relating to the
development of new products as follows                    2005      2004      2003
Gross expenditures for engineering
and software development     $ 12,855,000  $ 12,432,000  $ 11,027,000
Less: amounts capitalized      2,488,000   2,189,000   1,534,000
Net charged to operating
expenses           $ 10,367,000  $ 10,243,000  $ 9,493,000
Software development costs consisted of the following                             At December 31,
2005      2004
Capitalized software development costs       $ 9,595,000  $ 8,468,000
Less: accumulated amortization            6,413,000   4,815,000
Net                      $ 3,182,000  $ 3,653,000
Amortization of software development costs included in cost of goods sold was
$1,598,000, $1,711,000 and $1,005,000 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In
January 2006, the Company announced its intention to close its engineering
facility in Norwood, Massachusetts. In connection with that decision, in 2005,
the Company wrote off software development costs incurred at its Norwood
engineering center that were capitalized for new products that had not reached
commercial general release and were discontinued. This write-off totaled
$1,360,000.
Note Q - Employee Benefit Plans
For the Company operations in the United States, the Company Retirement
Savings Plans qualify under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code.
Discretionary matching contributions by the Company to the plans were $23,000 25,000 and $0 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In conjunction with its
flexible benefits plans, the Company made additional discretionary qualified
contributions to employee accounts which vest immediately amounting to $36,000 34,000 and $69,000 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
For its operations in Canada, contributions were made in 2005 and 2004 to a
Registered Retirement Savings Plan RRSP that is administered by the Canadian
government. Discretionary matching contributions to the Plan amounted to $5,000
and $7,000 for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company did not make any
matching contributions in 2003.
Note R - Litigation
Following the Company announcement in May 2000 regarding its preliminary
results of operations for the second quarter, several class action lawsuits were
filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York
against the Company, as well as several of its officers and directors, alleging
violations of federal securities laws. In September 2002, the Company announced
it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the settlement of the class
action litigation. The Company recorded a charge of $143,000 in the third
quarter of 2002 in connection with the litigation. During 2003, the settlement
agreement was accepted and approved by the Court and the settlement was paid by
the Company.
The Company is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise
in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of
any ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect
the financial position of the Company.
The Company issues indemnifications in the ordinary course of business with
certain customers, suppliers, services providers and business partners. Further,
the Company indemnifies its directors and officers who are, or were, serving at
the Company request in such capacities. The fair value of the
indemnifications that the Company issued during 2005 was not material to the
Company financial position, results of operations or cash flow.
Note S - Restructuring Programs
During 2002, the Company recorded restructuring charges related to the
consolidation of its operations in Raleigh, North Carolina. The initial
restructuring charge recorded in 2002 for lease commitments included certain
estimates for expected future sublease receipts. Due to market conditions in the
Raleigh, North Carolina area, the Company recorded an incremental restructuring
charge of $118,000 in 2003, which related to a revised estimate of the sublease
receipts expected through the remaining term of this lease. During 2004, the
Company paid the remaining lease obligation of $146,000 and the lease was
terminated. There were no outstanding obligations related to these charges at
December 31, 2004.
In October 2004, management announced a plan to centralize its multi-location
operations and to streamline the organization. By the end of the first quarter
2005, the Company completed centralization of sales, marketing and accounting
functions into corporate operations. During the third quarter 2005, the
transition of the manufacturing functions was completed. Total expenses incurred
and paid under this program were $320,000 and $217,000 in 2005 and 2004,
respectively.
In 2006, the Company announced its plans to close its engineering facility in
Norwood, Massachusetts and also to relocate its San Luis Obispo and Ottawa
operations to new locations in those local areas in 2006. Expenses related to
these actions will be expensed as incurred in 2006.

financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
i pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the Company assets; ii provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and
that the Company receipts and expenditures are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of the Company management and
directors; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
or disposition of the Company assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
Company internal control over financial reporting based on the
criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that
the Company internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2005, according to the criteria.
Management assessment of the effectiveness of the Company
internal control over financial reporting has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in
Item 8.

control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth
