REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the shareholders of Control Devices, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Control Devices,
Inc. an Indiana corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995,
and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 and the five months ended
December 31, 1994. We have also audited the accompanying combined statements of
income and cash flows of the Electromechanical Business of GTE Control Devices
Incorporated and Dominican Overseas Company Predecessor Company for the
seven months ended July 29, 1994. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Control Devices, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995
and the five months ended December 31, 1994, and the results of operations and
cash flows of the Predecessor Company for the seven months ended July 29, 1994,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

CONTROL DEVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Organization and Basis of Presentation:
Control Devices, Inc. CDI, which was organized on June 10, 1994,
designs, manufactures and markets circuit breakers, electronic ceramic
components parts and electronic sensors used by original equipment
manufacturers OEMs in the automotive, appliance and telecommunications
markets. On April 1, 1996, CDI purchased Realisations et Diffusion pour
l'Industrie RDI, which distributes these and other products in the
Northern European market from its headquarters near Paris, France. The
accompanying financial statements include the results of CDI and RDI from
the date of acquisition. The Company refers to both CDI and RDI
On July 29, 1994, CDI purchased certain assets and liabilities the
Business of GTE Control Devices Incorporated and Dominican Overseas
Trading Company collectively, the Seller, indirect wholly-owned
subsidiaries of GTE Corporation. For the period prior to the acquisition
date, the Business is referred to as the Predecessor Company. The
accompanying financial statements, including those of the Predecessor
Company prior to the acquisition date have been prepared by CDI management
and present the financial position and results of operations of CDI from
the acquisition date and of the Business for the period prior to the
acquisition date. Accordingly, the financial information for the period
prior to the acquisition date does not reflect the significant impact of
the acquisition, the related financing and the purchase accounting
adjustments on the financial position and results of operations of CDI.
The Predecessor Company financial statements include all significant
components of the Business and have been prepared solely by CDI, as if the
Business was operated as a separate entity for the period presented. The
Predecessor Company financial statements do not include an allocation of
any assets and liabilities not specifically identified to the Business,
including cash and intercompany debt.
2 Summary of Accounting Policies:
Principles of consolidation-
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated.
Use of estimates-
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Foreign currency translation and transactions-
Assets and liabilities of the Company foreign operations are translated
into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet
date. Results of operations are translated using the average exchange rate
prevailing throughout the period. The effects of exchange rate fluctuations
on translating foreign currency assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars
are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment component
F-8
2 Summary of Accounting Policies--Continued:
of shareholders' equity, while gains and losses resulting from foreign
currency transactions are included in net income.
Cash and cash equivalents-
Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investments with original
maturities of three months or less.
Trade receivables-
RDI practice is to sell part of its trade receivables to finance its
business. At December 31, 1996, such sales with recourse amounted to
$2,971,000 which have been deducted from trade receivables. Based on
historical collectibility of trade receivables, RDI obligations under the
recourse provisions are not material.
Inventories-
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost of
inventories is determined by the first-in, first-out FIFO method of
inventory valuation.
Property, plant and equipment-
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost and is depreciated using
the straight-line and various accelerated methods over the estimated useful
lives of the related plant and equipment. Ranges of the estimated useful
lives are as follows         The Company:
Machinery and equipment        3 to 15 years 
Building and building equipment    40 years
Predecessor Company          Machinery and equipment        3 to 16 years
Building and building equipment    10 to 50 years
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the terms of the respective
leases or the estimated useful lives of the improvements, whichever is
less. Maintenance, repairs and renewals are charged to expense as
incurred; betterments are capitalized.
Goodwill
As part of the acquisition of RDI, goodwill was recorded which represented
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the
identifiable underlying net assets acquired and is carried as an asset,
less accumulated amortization which is calculated on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful life of 40 years.
The Company periodically evaluates the periods over which intangible assets
are amortized to determine whether events have occurred which would require
modification to the amortization period. The Company reviews anticipated
future operating results and cash flows on an undiscounted basis in
determining whether there has been an impairment in the value of the excess
of purchase price over net assets acquired. An impairment loss would be
measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the impaired asset
F-9
2 Summary of Accounting Policies--Continued:
exceeds the fair value of the asset. That fair value would then become the
asset new cost basis. Amortization charged to operations amounted to
approximately $145,000 in 1996.
Income taxes-
The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as
set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are
determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax
bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates and
regulations.
Research and development-
Expenditures for Company-sponsored research and new product development are
expensed as incurred.
Environmental expenditures-
Environmental expenditures that relate to current or future revenues are
expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an
existing condition caused by past operations and that do not contribute to
current or future revenues are expensed.
Revenue recognition-
Revenue is recognized when products are shipped.
Earnings per share-
Earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of
common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the
period. Common equivalent shares are calculated using the treasury stock
method. For the year ended December 31, 1996 the computation included
46,002 Common Shares issuable upon exercise of stock options after the
assumed repurchase of Common Shares with related proceeds. There is no
difference between primary and fully diluted earnings per share.
Fair value of financial instruments-
The fair values of financial instruments closely approximate their carrying
values. The Company has no involvement with derivative financial
instruments.
3 Public Offering and Related Transactions:
In contemplation of the public offering described below on August 30, 1996,
the shareholders of the Company approved two amendments to the Company
Articles of Incorporation. The first amendment reclassified the outstanding
Class A Common Shares and Class B Common Shares as Common Shares and
eliminated the designations of the Class A and Class B Shares immediately
prior to the closing of the public offering. The second amendment
eliminated the 11% Cumulative Preferred Shares Redeemable Preferred
Shares when all the Redeemable Preferred Shares were redeemed in
connection with the public offering.
The Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, which was declared effective on October 2, 1996.

3 Public Offering and Related Transactions--Continued:
Shares in connection with the exercise of the underwriter overallotment
option granted in connection with the public offering and received net
proceeds of approximately $25 million.
The following transactions occurred substantially simultaneously with the
close of the public offering   a.  the exercise of the outstanding warrants described in Note 8 to
purchase 564,100 Class B Series 1 Common Shares at $001 per share   b.  the conversion of all 999,996 Class B Series 1 Common Shares

The supplemental net income per share would have been $106 and $094 for
the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively, assuming the
conversion of the RDI Convertible Notes only in 1996, the issuance of
2,146,488 and 2,018,333 Common Shares without deducting underwriters'
discount or offering expenses at the public offering price of $900 per
share and the application of proceeds thereof to retire the Company
Senior Notes plus accrued interest and the Redeemable Preferred Shares plus
accrued dividends, as of the beginning of each respective period. The
supplemental net income per share does not include the results of
operations for RDI prior to April 1, 1996.

transaction fees of approximately $500,000 were financed through a
combination of long-term debt and Common and Preferred Shares issued to
various investors.

On July 29, 1994, and as amended on March 29, 1996, CDI entered into an
agreement the Securities Purchase Agreement with a group of affiliated
lenders to provide CDI with $150 million of term loans and up to $30
million in revolving credit loans. The term loans were comprised of the 10%
Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes and the 11% Senior Subordinated Notes
collectively the Senior Notes. In connection with the public offering,
the Senior Notes were repaid without premium in October 1996.
Under the Securities Purchase Agreement, warrants to purchase 564,100
shares of Class B Series 1 Common Shares at $01 per share were issued to
the lenders. The proceeds received upon the issuance of the 11% Senior
Subordinated Notes of $45 million were allocated between the notes and the
warrants based on their estimated relative fair values. Accordingly,
$180,000, which represents the amount of the proceeds allocated to the
warrants, has been credited to additional paid-in-capital. The discount was
being amortized over the life of the notes. In October 1996, the remaining
unamortized discount of $130,000 $80,000, net of income tax effect was
charged to expense in connection with the repayment of the Senior Notes.
The RDI fixed rate loans bear interest at the weighted average rate of 77%
and are secured by certain assets of RDI.
The RDI Notes bear interest at 8% per annum and are due in three equal
annual installments commencing on April 1, 1997. CDI has the right to
prepay the RDI notes at any time without premium.
The RDI Convertible Notes bore interest at 65% per annum and were payable
in full on demand after April 1, 1999. In connection with the public
offering, the RDI Convertible Notes were converted into 99,155 Common
Shares in October 1996.

entered into an agreement, pursuant to which Fleet Bank has agreed to
provide a $150 million revolving line of credit facility to the Company to
fund strategic acquisitions and, if needed, for working capital. The
facility has a maturity date of September 30, 1998. The facility has three
interest rate options consisting of i Fleet Bank prime rate for daily
rate borrowings, ii Fleet Bank cost of funds rate plus 15% for
borrowings of 30 days or less, or iii the corresponding London Interbank
Offering Rate LIBOR plus 15% for borrowings of 30, 60, 90 or 180 days.
The line of credit is unsecured and contains certain financial and other
covenants including but not

limited to, minimum tangible net worth, debt to net worth, and minimum cash
flow coverage. The financial covenants are to be met on a quarterly basis.
The Company is in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 1996 and
believes that the covenants will not restrict its future operations. To
date, there have been no borrowings under this line of credit facility.
RDI has various credit facilities available to it totaling $08 million
with rates ranging from 05% to 10% over the Paris Inter-Bank Offered
Rate. At December 31, 1996, RDI had borrowings aggregating $05 million
under these facilities.

connection with the public offering, the Redeemable Preferred Shares plus
accrued dividends were repaid without premium in October 1996. The
liquidation preference value of the Redeemable Preferred Shares $1,000 per
share plus accrued dividends was $2,774,000 at December 31, 1995. At

11 Stock Option Plans:
The Company has reserved 300,000 Common Shares for issuance pursuant to its
1996 Stock Compensation Plan the Plan. The Plan provides for the
awarding of incentive stock options and director options on Common Shares
from time to time at the discretion of the Company. Options become
exercisable one year after the date of grant and shall be exercised no
later than 10 years from the date of grant. Pursuant to the Plan, on
October 2, 1996 the Company granted options to purchase 150,000 Common
Shares to certain employees and officer, and on October 25, 1996, the
Company granted options to purchase 75,000 Common Shares to certain
officers of the Company. The exercise price per share for options issued on
October 2, 1996 and October 25, 1996 was $900 and $1056, respectively. At
December 31, 1996, no director options have been granted. All options vest
one year after the date of grant and may be exercised subsequent to one
year after the date of grant up to a maximum of approximately 10,000
options per individual per year.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-
Based Compensation, encourages, but does not require companies to record
compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation plans at fair
value. The Company has chosen to continue to account for stock-based
compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock issued to
Employees, and related interpretations. Accordingly, had compensation cost
for these plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates,
the Company net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to
the following pro forma amounts      Net Income       As Reported:     $4,066
Pro forma:      3,993
Earnings per share   As Reported:     $129
Pro forma:      126
The fair values of the management and officer option grants were estimated
on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the
following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 1996; dividend
yield of 0%, expected volatility of 26%, expected life of 5 years and 10
years, respectively, and risk free interest rates of 635% and 654   respectively.
At December 31, 1996 the Company had 225,000 options outstanding at
exercise prices ranging from $900 to $1056. These options had a weighted-
average exercise price of $952, a weighted average fair value of
F-16
11 Stock Option Plans-Continued:
$407, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 98 years. No
options are exercisable until October 1997. 12 Income Taxes:
The Predecessor Company operated as a division, and income taxes were not
allocated to it. The accompanying financial statements of the Predecessor
Company reflect an allocated provision for income taxes using an effective
tax rate of 40%, the estimated combined rate for current and deferred state
and federal income taxes. The related current or deferred income taxes
payable would have been transferred to the Seller, if allocated, and are
included in the net assets of the Predecessor Company.

permanently reinvested in such foreign operations. The unrecognized tax
liability on the undistributed foreign earnings is not significant at
December 31, 1996.
Cash paid for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995,
and the five months ended December 31, 1994 was $2,009,000, $1,946,000 and

13 Employee Benefits:
CDI maintains a 401k savings plan for substantially all domestic
employees. Under the plan, CDI matches employee contributions subject to
the discretion of the board of directors. The expense for the employer
contribution for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, for the five
months ended December 31, 1994, was $390,000, $301,000 and $137,000,
respectively.
The Predecessor Company employees participated in Seller-sponsored
defined benefit, postretirement health and life insurance, and savings and
investment plans. The expense for these plans, which was allocated by the
Seller to the Predecessor Company see Note 1, was $94,000, for the seven
months ended July 29, 1994. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the

financial condition and results of operations.

16 Customer Information-Continued:
and another customer accounted for $7,075,000, $7,647,000, $3,315,000 of
sales, respectively, during these periods.
17 Supplier Information:
The Company relies on a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers for
certain key components of its products. The Company does not have a long-
term supply agreement with any of these suppliers, and operates under
purchase orders. The Company reliance on sole or a limited group of
suppliers involves several risks, including a potential inability to obtain
an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over pricing
and timely delivery of components. Although the timeliness, yield and
quality of deliveries to date from the Company suppliers have been
acceptable, any prolonged inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any
other circumstances that would require the Company to seek alternative
sources of supply could delay the Company ability to ship its products,
which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and
could therefore have a material adverse effect on the Company results of
operations.
18 Consulting Agreements:
In April 1995, the Company entered several agreements with an individual to
provide design and marketing consulting services to the Company. The terms
of the agreements also provide for minimum cash royalty and license
payments. The agreements begin to expire in March 2001, and allow for
cancellation by either party. In connection with these agreements, the
Company paid the individual a one time payment of $200,000 in 1995 and
granted a non-qualified stock options to purchase up to 200,000 Common
Shares at any time until March 31, 2001 at $900 per Common Share. In
addition, royalty payments were approximately $247,000, and $223,000, for
the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
19 International Manufacturing and Distribution:
The Company has international manufacturing facilities located in San
Cristobal, Dominican Republic. Included in the Company balance sheet at
December 31, 1996, are the net assets of the Company international
manufacturing operations which totaled approximately $1,380,000. This
operation manufactured products accounting for approximately 34% of the
Company gross revenues in 1996.
RDI distributes its products primarily to automotive OEMs in Northern
Europe. The Company results of operations are therefore subject to
European economic conditions. RDI generates revenues and incurs expenses
primarily in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, there is
increased financial risk to the Company based on fluctuations in currency
exchange rates. Changes in exchange rates, therefore, may have a
significant effect on the Company financial condition and results of
operations. At December 31, 1996, the net assets of RDI, including
goodwill, were approximately $94 million.
