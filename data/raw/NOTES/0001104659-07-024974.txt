Procedures.
Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e of the Securities
and Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the Companys Exchange Act reports is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission regulations,
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys
management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As of December 31, 2006, the management of the Company carried out an
assessment of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures and concluded
that, except as set forth below, they were effective as of the end of the
period covered by this report.
As previously reported, the Company did not have
effective controls to accurately calculate current income tax expense. Specifically, the Company did not have
effective controls to monitor the difference between the income tax basis and
the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and reconcile the
difference to its deferred income tax asset and liability balances. Management
had determined that these deficiencies could lead to a material misstatement of
deferred taxes, tax accruals and the tax provision that would not be prevented
or detected. Accordingly, management
determined that this control deficiency represented a material weakness in the
Companys disclosure controls and procedures.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, due to
the limited tenure of the Companys accounting staff, additional
reconciliations and post-closing adjustments were necessary to properly account
for certain items of income and expense that the staff was not fully aware
of. The most significant manifestations
of this material weakness involved 25 the accounting of the Companys workers compensation
liability as well as the Companys unvouchered accounts payable balance.
One of the Companys subsidiaries, Bushman Tanks, was
previously a closely-held, family run business with mostly manual controls in place.
During the process of assessing the status of the internal control
infrastructure, the Company identified significant deficiencies in internal
controls that rose to the level of material weaknesses in the revenue and
purchasing cycles.
As a result of the weaknesses identified in managements
evaluation, the Company committed to take the following actions to improve the
Companys internal control over financial reporting Set
up a procedure to accurately prepare and review its accounting for income taxes
and the determination of income taxes payable, deferred income tax assets and
liabilities and the related income tax provision.
Engage
additional personnel qualified as Certified Public Accountants to assist in the
preparation of the Companys income taxes.
Train
new staff regarding the accounting for workers compensation liability as well
as the Companys unvouchered accounts payable balance.
Engage
actuarial consultants to assist management in determining the appropriate
accrual for the Companys workers compensation liability.
Implement
the Companys Oracle information system in the Bushman Tanks subsidiary to
improve the processes in the revenue and purchasing cycles. The Company has
developed a plan to complete the implementation in the first half of 2007. Therefore, remediation of the material
weaknesses in purchasing and revenue cycles in the Bushman Tanks subsidiary is
not yet complete.
Changes in
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
During the three months ended December 31, 2006 and
during the financial close process for that quarter, the Company took the
following actions that it believes addressed the material weaknesses related to
the accounting for income taxes, the workers compensation liability and the
unvouchered accounts payable balance and strengthened its internal control over
financial reporting.
Completed
the restructuring of the Companys process to accurately prepare and review its
accounting for income taxes and the determination of income taxes payable. The Company
engaged additional personnel qualified as Certified Public Accountants to
assist in the preparation of the Companys income tax provision as well as
general accounting matters.
Completed
the training of the Companys staff in the preparation and analysis of the
Companys workers compensation liability and unvouchered accounts payable
balance. The Company engaged qualified
actuarial consultants to assist the Company in determining the appropriate
accrual for workers compensation liability.
