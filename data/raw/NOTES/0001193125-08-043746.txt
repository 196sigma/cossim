24 PARTII Item5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the
Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commissions rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. We carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, of
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2007.Based on that evaluation, our management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of December31, 2007. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and
15d-15f of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide 
39 Table of Contents
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2007. In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on that assessment, our management, concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2007, based on the criteria issued by COSO in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. BDO Seidman, LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited
our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, which is set forth below under Report of

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders SigmaTel, Inc.
Austin, Texas We have audited SigmaTel, Inc.s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. The
Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A,
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is
a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, SigmaTel, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheet of SigmaTel, Inc. as of December 31, 2007 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for the year
ended December 31, 2007, and our report dated February 21, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ BDO Seidman, LLP Houston, Texas February 21, 2008
