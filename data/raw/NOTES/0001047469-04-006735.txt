MONSTER WORLDWIDE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS in thousands, except per share amounts    
1.BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
The Company continuing operations consist of three business segments: Monster, Advertising Communications and Directional
Marketing. Revenue is
primarily earned from job postings placed on the Company career website, Monster, resume and other database access, selling and placing recruitment advertising, resume screening services and selling
and placing Yellow Pages advertising. These services are provided to customers in a variety of industries throughout North America, Europe and the Asia/Pacific Region. On
March31, 2003, the Company completed the distribution the spin-off of the common stock of Hudson Highland Group,Inc. HH Group, previously reported
as the eResourcing and Executive Search divisions of Monster Worldwide. The spin-off was effected by way of a pro-rata tax free dividend the Distribution of the common
stock of HH Group to holders of Monster Worldwide common stock on March31, 2003. In the Distribution, Monster Worldwide stockholders received one share of HH Group common stock for every
131/3 shares of Monster Worldwide common stock owned. Monster Worldwide stockholders paid no consideration for the shares of HH Group stock they received. As a result of the
spin-off, the Company financial statements have been classified to reflect HH Group as discontinued operations for all periods presented see Note14. 
In
August2003, the Company terminated its joint venture arrangement in Australia and New Zealand the Disposition. As a result of the Disposition, the Company shut down its
websites in Australia and New Zealand Monster.au and Monster.nz and redirected all traffic to its Monster.com website.
The Company shut down plan included employee terminations, client notifications and property abandonment and was substantially complete as of August15, 2003. As a result of the Disposition,
the Company financial statements have been classified to reflect the termination of the joint venture arrangement as discontinued operations for all periods presented see Note14. 
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
2.ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Revenue Recognition and Work-In-Process 
Monster.The Company Monster division primarily earns revenue from the placement of job postings on the websites within the Monster
network, access to the Monster network online resume database and other ancillary services. The Company recognizes revenue at the time that job postings are displayed on the Monster network
websites. Revenue earned from subscriptions to the Monster network resume database is recognized over the length of the underlying subscriptions, typically one to twelve months. Revenue associated
with multiple element contracts is allocated based on the relative fair value of the services included in the contract. Unearned revenues are reported on the balance sheet as deferred revenue. 
Advertising Communications.The Company Advertising Communications division derives revenue for job advertisements
placed in newspapers, Internet career job boards such as Monster and other media, plus associated fees for related services. Revenue is recorded net of media placement costs, which are passed on to
the customer. Revenue is generally recognized upon placement date for newspapers and other media. Online media revenue is recognized when services are purchased. 
44  Directional Marketing.The Company Directional Marketing division derives revenue from the placement of advertisements in telephone
directories Yellow Pages advertising. Revenue for Yellow Pages advertisements are recognized on the publications' closing dates and are recorded net of publisher advertising costs, which is passed
on to the customer. Direct operating costs incurred that relate to future revenue for Yellow Pages advertisements, are deferred recorded as work-in-process in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets and subsequently charged to expense when the directories are closed for publication and the related commission is recognized as income. In addition, the Company earns
revenue from mortgage companies, real estate firms and other companies that place advertisements on its online relocation portal, Monstermoving. Revenue derived from such advertisements is recognized
over the stated terms of fixed contracts, or upon referral to advertisers on our website for performance based contracts. 
Marketing and Promotion  Advertising and production costs are recorded to expense the first time an advertisement appears. All other advertising costs are expensed
as incurred. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable
approximate fair value
because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying amount reported for long-term debt approximates fair value because, in general, the
interest on the underlying instruments fluctuates with market rates. In instances where long-term debt carries fixed interest rates, the obligation is recorded at the present value of the
future payments. 
Concentrations of Risk 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents and
accounts receivable. Cash
and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally these deposits may be redeemed
upon demand. The Company also invests in short term commercial paper rated P1 by Moody or A1 by Standard Poors or better. The
Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers and does not require collateral. The Company has not experienced significant losses related to receivables from
individual customers or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area. 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires
management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include, among others, allowances for doubtful accounts, net realizable values on long-lived assets and deferred tax
assets, certain accrued expense accounts and revenue recognition. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
45  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consist of commercial paper and time deposits, are stated at cost, which approximates fair
value. For financial
statement presentation purposes, the Company considers all highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Outstanding checks in excess of account
balances typically represent publisher payments, payroll and other contractual obligations disbursed on or near the last day of a reporting period. 
Accounts Receivable 
The Company accounts receivable primarily consist of trade receivables and earned commissions receivable. Earned commissions receivable
represent Yellow Pages
commissions that have not been billed to customers. As of December31, 2003 and 2002, earned commissions receivable were $7,357 and $7,388, respectively. Management reviews accounts receivable
on a monthly basis to determine if any receivables will potentially be uncollectible. The Company includes any accounts receivable balances that are determined to be uncollectible, in its allowance
for doubtful accounts. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. Based on the information available, the Company believes its
allowance for doubtful accounts as of December31, 2003 is adequate. However, actual write-offs could exceed the recorded allowance. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts
is as follows: Year ended December 31, 
Beginning Balance

and Expenses
Write-offs and
Other
Ending Balance 2003 25,006 12,680 19,460 18,226 2002 29,930 6,600 11,524 25,006 2001 28,698 15,135 13,903 29,930 Property and Equipment 
Computer and communications equipment, furniture and fixtures and capitalized software costs are stated at cost and are depreciated using
the straight line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 3 to 10years. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and amortized, using the straight line method, over their estimated
useful lives, or the lives of their related leases, whichever is shorter. Capitalized Software Costs 
Capitalized software costs consist of costs to purchase and develop software for internal use. The Company capitalizes certain incurred
software development
costs in accordance with, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA issued Statement of Position No98-1, Accounting for the Cost of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use SOP 98-1. Costs incurred during the application-development stage for software bought and further
customized by outside vendors for the Company use and software developed by a vendor for the Company proprietary use have been capitalized. Costs incurred related to the Company own personnel
who are directly associated with software development are capitalized as appropriate. 
46  Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Accounting Change 
Goodwill represents acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets of businesses purchased. Other
intangible assets
primarily consist of the value of client lists, non-compete agreements, trademarks and goodwill. With the exception of goodwill, intangible assets are being amortized over periods ranging
from two to thirty years. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
SFAS142, the Company evaluates goodwill annually for impairment, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. The determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired
involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of the Company reporting units. Changes in the Company strategy and or market
conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets. In
connection with the Company implementation of SFAS142, a non-cash charge of $428,374, net of tax, was recorded at January1, 2002 and is reflected in the
Company consolidated statement of operations as a cumulative effect of accounting change for the year ended December31, 2002. The Company has adopted a policy to review each reporting unit
for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach that uses forward-looking assumptions regarding market share, revenues and costs for each reporting unit as well as appropriate discount rates. The
write-down of goodwill shown as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2002 was determined using the
forward-looking assumptions that was available to us on January1, 2002. In 2002 and 2003, the Company again reviewed each reporting unit for impairment and no further impairment was
identified. The estimates used were consistent with the plans and estimates that the Company was using to manage the underlying business. 
SFAS142
also requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless those lives are determined to be indefinite. As a result,
the Company ceased amortizing goodwill effective January1, 2002. The following tables present a reconciliation of net income and earnings per share for the year ended December31, 2001,
adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization, net of income taxes. Goodwill was not amortized in the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002. Year Ended
December 31,
2001 Net Income Reconciliation Reported net income 69,020 Add back: Goodwill amortization, net of tax 20,470 Adjusted net income 89,490 Earnings Per Share Reconciliation Basic Earnings per share Reported net income 063 Add back: Goodwill amortization, net of tax 019 Adjusted net income 082 47  Diluted Earnings Per Share Reported net income 061 Add back: Goodwill amortization, net of tax 018 Adjusted net income 079 Weighted average shares outstanding Basic 109,445 Diluted 113,426 Long-Lived Assets 
Long-lived assets, other than goodwill, are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the
carrying
amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets and its eventual
disposition is less than its carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is assessed using discounted cash flows. The determination of whether or not long-lived assets have become impaired
involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of those assets. Changes in our
strategy, assumptions and/or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of long-lived assets. During the year ended
December31, 2003, we recorded a $25,783 impairment charge as a component of business reorganization, spin-off and other special charges, relating to certain software and other
equipment that will no longer be utilized as designed, as a direct result of the spin-off transaction. 
Foreign Currency Translation  The financial position and results of operations of the Company foreign subsidiaries are determined using local currency as the
functional currency. Assets and
liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during
the year. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included in other comprehensive income loss, a component of stockholders' equity.
Cumulative translation adjustments, which are reported as components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss, were $58,965 and $14,750 as of December31, 2003 and 2002 respectively.
Gains and losses resulting from other foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense. 
Income Taxes 
Income taxes are computed on the pretax income loss based on the current tax law. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected
tax consequences in
future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date and are 
48  based
on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates. Valuation allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets to the extent their ultimate realization is uncertain. 
Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company financial statements are presented in accordance with the Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees APB No25. Under APB No25, generally, no compensation expense is recognized in connection with the awarding of stock option
grants to employees provided that, as of the grant date, all terms associated with the award are fixed and the quoted market price of the stock is equal to or less than the amount an employee must pay
to acquire the stock as defined. As the Company only issues fixed term stock option grants at or above the quoted market price on the date of the grant, there has been no compensation expense
recognized in the accompanying financial statements. The Company adopted the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS123, which requires certain financial statement disclosures, including pro forma operating results had the Company prepared its consolidated
financial statements in accordance with the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation. The
Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no restrictions and are fully transferable and negotiable in a free
trading market. Black-Scholes does not consider the employment, transfer or vesting restrictions that are inherent in the Company employee options. Use of an option valuation model, as required by
SFAS123, includes highly subjective assumptions based on long-term predictions, including the expected stock price volatility and average life of each option grant. Because the
Company employee options have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the Company
estimate of the fair value of those options, in the Company opinion, the existing valuation models, including Black-Scholes, are not reliable single measures and may misstate the fair value of the
Company employee options. 
As
required under SFAS123 and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and
Disclosure SFAS148, the pro forma effects of stock-based compensation on net income loss and net earnings per share have been estimated at the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following weighted average assumptions: Years Ended December 31 2003
2002
2001 Risk-free interest rate
43 42 45 Volatility
649 735 750 Expected life years
50
75
75 For
purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is assumed to be amortized and expensed over the options' vesting periods. Certain stock options issued to
employees of HH Group were forfeited in accordance with plan provisions. Accordingly, the Company has adjusted pro forma stock based compensation expense in the year ended December31, 2003 to
reflect the forfeitures. The pro forma effects of recognizing compensation expense under the fair value method on the Company operating results and per share data are as follows:

Basic earnings per share does not include the effects of potentially dilutive stock options and is computed by dividing income available
to common shareholders
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects, in periods in which they
have a dilutive effect, common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options for periods in which the options' exercise price is lower than the Company average share price for the period. A
reconciliation of shares used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per common and ClassB common share follows: December 31 2003

stock options were excluded from the computation of earnings per share due to their antidilutive effect. The weighted average number of such options is approximately 11,897,
12,829, and 5,102 for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company continuing operations reported income in the year ended December31, 2003. As a result, certain stock options are
considered to have a dilutive effect during this period. Comprehensive Income Loss 
Comprehensive income loss is defined to include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and
distributions to owners. The
Company items of other comprehensive income loss are foreign currency translation adjustments, which relate to investments that are permanent in nature, and unrealized gains and losses on forward
foreign exchange contracts used to manage foreign currency risk, net of applicable income taxes. To the extent that such amounts related to investments that are permanent in nature, no adjustments for
income taxes are made. 
50  Foreign Currency Risk Management 
Effective January1, 2001 the Company adopted SFAS133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, as amended by SFAS138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities,
collectively referred to as SFAS133. SFAS133 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The adoption of this standard did not have a
material impact on the Company financial statements. The
Company periodically enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to offset certain operational and balance sheet exposures from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such
exposures result from the portion of the Company operations, assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound, Euro and Australian
dollar. From time to time the Company also uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset foreign currency exposures related to upcoming acquisitions. The contracts that relate to firm,
identifiable foreign currency commitments are designated as cash flow hedges and the gains and losses resulting from the impact of currency exchange rate movements on these contracts are not
recognized in operations until the underlying hedge transactions are recognized. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from the impact of currency exchange rate movements on forward foreign exchange
contracts designated to offset certain non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities are recognized as other comprehensive income loss and offset the foreign currency gains and
losses on the underlying exposures being hedged. Cumulative unrealized losses, which are reported as components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss, were $37 and $348 as of
December31, 2003 and 2002 respectively The Company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes. Reclassifications 
Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made for consistent presentation. 
Effect of Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
In December2003, the SEC published Staff Accounting Bulletin No104, Revenue
Recognition SAB
104. SAB 104 was effective upon issuance and supercedes SAB No101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements SAB 101 and rescinds the
accounting guidance contained in SAB 101 related to multiple-element revenue arrangements that was superseded by Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No00-21 EITF
00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Additionally, SAB 104 rescinds portions of the interpretive
guidance included in Topic 13 of the codification of staff accounting bulletins. While the wording of SAB 104 has changed to reflect the issuance of EITF 00-21, the revenue recognition
principles of SAB 101 have remained largely unchanged. The adoption of SAB 104 did not have a material effect on the Company financial statements. 
In
May2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables. EITF 00-21 addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating
activities; specifically, how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration should be measured and
allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement. EITF 00-21 does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria. EITF 00-21 is effective for
revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after 
51  June15,
2003. The adoption of EITF 00-21 did not have a material effect on the Company financial statements.

4.GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
During the year ended December31, 2003, goodwill increased primarily due to an increase in foreign currency exchange rates,

Pound, Euro, and Swedish Krona. In addition, through December31, 2003, the Company recorded goodwill of $8,404 in its Advertising Communications division for the purchase of a
regional, U.S. based recruitment advertising firm, and $5,447 in its Monster division for the purchase of QuickHire,Inc. QuickHire. The Company also purchased its remaining interest in its

revolving credit
facility with a group of lenders. The credit facility is secured by substantially all of the Company assets and is available for ongoing working capital requirements and other corporate purposes.
Under the credit facility, loans will bear interest, at the Company option at either 1the higher of aprime rate or bFederal Funds rate plus 1/2 of 1 plus a margin of 025% until the Company reports its financials for the quarter ending March31, 2004 and thereafter the margin will be determined by the ratio of our debt to earnings before

A Common and ClassB Common Stock 
Common and ClassB common stock have identical rights except that each share of ClassB common stock is entitled to ten votes
and is convertible,
at any time, at the option of the stockholder into one share of common stock. On
February29, 2000, the Company effected a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend. All share and per share amounts in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been restated to give effect to the stock split. 
B Share Repurchase Program 
In September2002, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan to acquire outstanding common stock on the open market.
Under the terms of the
plan, the Company was authorized to repurchase up to five million shares of common stock from time-to-time
as conditions warranted. The Company Board of Directors authorized these purchases to occur through March3, 2004. As of December31, 2003, the Company had repurchased 927 shares of
its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $9,842 in cash. No additional purchases have been made under this program. 
C Stock Options 
In January1996, the Company Board of Directors the Board adopted the 1996 Employee Stock Option Plan the Stock Option Plan,
which provides for
the issuance of both incentive stock options within the meaning of Section422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended the Code, and nonqualified stock options, to purchase an
aggregate of up to 6,000 shares of common stock 
61  of
the Company, as amended on April27, 1998. The Stock Option Plan permits the granting of options to officers, employees and consultants of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates. Under
this plan, the exercise price of an incentive stock option must be at least equal to 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant 110% of the fair market value in the case
of options granted to employees who hold more than ten percent of the voting power of the Company capital stock on the date of grant. The exercise price of a nonqualified stock option must be not
less than the par value of a share of the common stock on the date of grant. The term of an incentive or nonqualified stock option is not to exceed ten years five years in the case of an incentive
stock option granted to a ten percent holder. The Stock Option Plan provides that the maximum option grant that may be made to an executive officer in any calendar year is 300 shares as amended on
June25, 1997. At December31, 2003, approximately 830 options were exercisable and approximately 1,400 options are available for future grants. In
January1996, the Company adopted a stock option plan for non-employee directors the Directors' Plan, pursuant to which options to acquire a maximum of 360
shares of common stock may be granted to non-employee directors. Options granted under the Directors' Plan do not qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of
Section422 of the Code. The Directors' Plan provides for an automatic grant to each of the Company non-employee directors of an option to purchase 225 shares of common stock on
the date of such director initial election or appointment to the Board. The options will have an exercise price of 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, have a
ten-year term and become exercisable in accordance with a vesting schedule determined by the Board of Directors. In December, 1998 the Director Plan was replaced by the 1999 Plan see
below and as such, no options are available for future grants under the Director Plan. At December31, 2003, approximately 48 options were exercisable under this plan. 
In
December1998, the Company adopted a long-term incentive plan the 1999 Plan, pursuant to which stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and
other equity based awards may be granted. Stock options that may be granted may be incentive stock options and
nonqualified stock options within the meaning of the Code. The total number of shares of the common stock of the Company that may be granted under the 1999 Plan is the sum of 30,000 and the number of
shares available for new awards under the Stock Option Plan. At December31, 2003, approximately 10,900 options were exercisable and 8,800 options are available for future grants. 
Amounts
below reflect option activity of employees in the Company continuing operations as well as HH Group employees. The outstanding stock options of the Company were adjusted in
the 2003 period to reflect the impact of the spin-off transaction. For employees who continued employment with the Company, the option remained an option for Monster Worldwide common stock
with the number of shares and the related exercise price adjusted to preserve the intrinsic value of each option. For employees 
62  who
worked for HH Group after the spin-off, certain options were cancelled in accordance with the provisions of the spin-off agreement. December 31, 2003

tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to the Company deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: December 31 2003
2002 Deferred tax assets Allowance for doubtful accounts 6,543 8,808 Accrued expenses and other liabilities 3,946 Accrued business reorganization and spin-off costs 10,057 15,375 Other reserves not currently deductible 3,117 Tax loss carry forwards 61,705 46,249 Tax credits 1,394 1,374 Valuation allowance 39,472 23,578 Deferred tax assets 47,290 48,228 Deferred tax liabilities Earned commissions 2,945 2,302 Work-in-process 4,230 4,899 Accrued expenses and other liabilities 957 Property and equipment 8,076 8,070 Intangibles 6,609 2,320 Deferred tax liabilities 21,860 18,548 Net deferred tax assets 25,430 29,680 64 
As
of December31, 2003 and 2002, net current deferred tax assets were $15,721 and $13,231, respectively and net non-current deferred tax assets were $15,712 and
$16,449, respectively. Net non-current deferred tax liabilities were $6,003 as on December31, 2003. At
December31, 2003, the Company has net operating loss carry forwards, related to its continuing operations, for U.S. Federal tax purposes of approximately $30,000, which
expire in stages beginning 2020 through 2022, and operating loss carry forwards in the United Kingdom of approximately $66,000 with no expiration periods. In addition, the Company also has
approximately $84,000 of net operating loss carry forwards in various other countries throughout the world. 
Realization
of the Company net deferred tax assets is dependant upon the Company generating sufficient taxable income in future years in the appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain a
benefit from the reversal of deductible temporary differences and from tax loss carry-forwards. 
The
Company has concluded that, based on expected future results and the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences there is no reasonable assurance that certain
deferred tax assets can be used, principally net operating losses in foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been established. During the year 2003 the valuation allowance on
deferred tax assets increased by $15,894, of which $7,775 related to the Company continuing operations, which includes an adjustment of $3,440 to beginning of the year deferred tax assets mainly as
a result of the spin-off of HH Group. 
In
addition, deferred tax benefits from the exercise of nonqualified stock options were recorded net of a valuation allowance as additional paid-in capital. Should this
portion of the valuation allowance be reversed which is approximately $2,800, the resulting benefit will be recorded as additional paid-in capital. In
connection with the cumulative effect of accounting change described in Note2, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset of $6,000 in 2002, related to its continuing
operations. 
Income
taxes related to the Company continuing operations differs from the amount computed using the Federal statutory income tax rate as follows: Year Ended December 31 2003

Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings have
been and
will continue to be reinvested but could become subject to additional tax if they were remitted as dividends, or were loaned to the Company or a U.S. affiliate, or if the Company should sell its stock
in the foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the amount of additional tax, if any, that might be payable on the undistributed foreign earnings. The Company does not believe there
are any undistributed foreign earnings. 
12.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

D Litigation 
The Company is subject to various claims from taxing authorities, lawsuits and other complaints arising in the ordinary course of
business. The Company records
provisions for losses when claims become probable and the amounts are estimable. Although the outcome of these legal matters cannot be determined, it is the opinion of management that the final
resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company financial condition, operations or liquidity.

in 2000, which were taxed directly to the owners of the pooled entities. 
15.SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA 
The following segment information is presented in accordance with SFAS No131, Disclosures about Segments of
an Enterprise and
Related Information SFAS131. This standard is based on a management approach that requires segmentation based upon the Company internal organization and
disclosure of revenue and operating income based upon internal accounting methods. The Company financial reporting systems present various data for management to operate the business, including
internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. 
The
Company operates in three business segments: Monster, Advertising Communications and Directional Marketing. Corporate level operating expenses are allocated to the segments
and are included in the operating results below. The Company has structured its operations to encourage the cross selling of Monster. Products and services sold by other operating segments on behalf
