41 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Rush Enterprises, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rush
Enterprises, Inc. a Texas corporation, and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2001 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2002.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Rush Enterprises,
Inc., and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2002, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. As
discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2002 the
company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill
and other Intangible Assets.

ENTERPRISES, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION
AND OPERATIONS Rush Enterprises, Inc. the Company, was incorporated in June 1996
under the laws of the State of Texas.
The Company, founded in 1965, now operates a Heavy-Duty Truck segment,
and a Construction Equipment segment and a Retail segment. The Heavy-Duty Truck segment operates a
regional network of 35 truck centers that provide an integrated one-stop source
for the trucking needs of its customers, including retail sales of new
Peterbilt and used heavy-duty trucks; parts, service and body shop facilities;
and financial services, including assisting in the financing of new and used
truck purchases, insurance products and truck leasing and rentals. The Companys truck centers are located in
areas on or near major highways in Texas, California, Colorado, Oklahoma,
Louisiana, Arizona and New Mexico. The
Construction Equipment segment, formed during 1997, operates a John Deere equipment center in Houston,
Texas. A portion of this segment, that
operated five John Deere Equipment Centers in Michigan, was discontinued during
2002 see Note 3. Dealership
operations include the retail sale of new and used equipment, after-market
parts and service facilities, equipment rentals and the financing of new and
used equipment see Note 18. The
Retail segments primary line of business is the retail sale of farm and ranch
supplies including fencing, horse and cattle trailers, veterinarian supplies
and western wear. The Retail segment is currently operating as a discontinued
operation pending disposal see Note 3. In November 2001, the Company acquired the assets of Perfection
Equipment Company, Inc. Perfection. Perfections primary lines of business
are oil and gas up-fitting, medium duty truck accessory and up-fitting, and
parts distribution. In August 2001, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets
of El Paso Great Basin Trucks, Inc. El Paso Trucks, which consisted of two
dealership locations in El Paso, Texas and Las Cruces, New Mexico. El Paso Trucks primary line of business is
the sale of new Peterbilt and used heavy-duty trucks, parts and service. As part of the Companys corporate reorganization in connection with
its initial public offering Offering in June 1996, the Company acquired, as a
wholly owned subsidiary, a managing general agent the MGA to manage all of
the operations of Associated Acceptance, Inc. AA. W. Marvin Rush, the sole shareholder of AA, is prohibited from
the sale or transfer of the capital stock of AA under the MGA agreement, except
as designated by the Company.
Therefore, the financial position and operations of AA have been
included as part of the Companys consolidated financial position and results
of operations for all periods presented. 47 Effective at the close of business on July 9, 2002 the Record Date,
pursuant to action taken by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting of the
Company held July 9, 2002, and described in the Proxy Statement dated May 15,
2002, the Board of Directors of the Company reclassified the outstanding common
stock, $001 par value per share the Old Common Stock, as Class B Common
Stock, $001 par value per share the Class B Common Stock, and declared a
stock dividend of one share of a new Class A Common Stock, $01 par value per
share, for each share of Class B Common Stock held by shareholders of record on
the Record Date. Each share of Class A Common Stock ranks substantially equal
to each share of Class B Common Stock with respect to receipt of any dividends
or distributions declared on shares of common stock and the right to receive
proceeds on liquidation or dissolution of the Company after payment of the
Companys indebtedness and liquidation preference payments to holders of
preferred shares. However, holders of
Class A Common Stock will have 1/20th of one vote per share on all
matters requiring a shareholder vote, while holders of Class B Common Stock
will retain their full vote per share.
The Companys stock trades under the symbols RUSHA and RUSHB. Prior to the reclassification and stock
dividend, the Company had 7,002,044 shares of Old Common Stock
outstanding. Subsequent to the
reclassification and stock dividend, the Company has 7,002,044 shares of Class
A Common Stock and 7,002,004 shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding. For purposes of calculating earnings per
share amounts the Company is using 14,004,088 basic common shares for all
periods presented. Additionally, all
stock option information in Note 12 has been adjusted to reflect the above
transaction for all periods presented.
The adjustment has caused the total number of options to double, and the
grant price per option to be reduced by 50%.
There are an equal amount of Class A and Class B Common Stock options
outstanding as of December 31, 2002. All significant interdivision and intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period balances have been reclassified for
comparative purposes. 2. SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES Estimates in Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
UnitedStates generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual
results may differ from those estimates. 48 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined by specific
identification for new and used truck and construction equipment inventory and
by the first-in, first-out method for tires, parts and accessories. An allowance is provided when it is
anticipated that cost will exceed net realizable value. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful
lives. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the useful life of the improvement, or the term of the lease,
whichever is shorter. Provision for
depreciation of property and equipment is calculated primarily on a
straight-line basis. The Company
capitalizes interest on borrowings during the active construction period of
major capital projects. Capitalized
interest is added to the cost of underlying assets and is amortized over the
estimated useful life of such assets.
During 2000, 2001 and 2002, the Company capitalized approximately
$620,000, $0, and $0, respectively, in connection with various capital
projects. The cost, accumulated
depreciation and amortization and estimated useful lives are summarized as

Allowance for Doubtful Receivables and Repossession Losses The Company provides an allowance for doubtful receivables and
repossession losses after considering historical loss experience and other
factors, which might affect the collection of accounts receivable and the
ability of customers to meet their obligations on finance contracts sold by the
Company. 49 Other Assets Other assets consist primarily of goodwill related to acquisitions of
approximately $413million and $377million, as of
December31, 2001 and 2002, respectively.
Accumulated amortization of other assets, at December31, 2001 and
2002, was approximately $53million and $44 million, respectively. Annually, the Company assesses the
appropriateness of the asset valuations of other assets and the related
amortization period if applicable. Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets addresses financial accounting and
reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes APB
Opinion No. 17, Intangible Assets.
Statement No. 142 addresses how intangible assets that are acquired
individually or with a group of other assets but not those acquired in a
business combination should be accounted for in financial statements upon
their acquisition. This Statement also
addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for
after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements. The provisions of Statement No. 142 became
effective January 1, 2002. This
Statement is required to be applied at the beginning of an entitys fiscal year
and to be applied to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in its
financial statements at that date.
Impairment losses for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
that arise due to the initial application of Statement No. 142 are to be
reported as resulting from a change in accounting principle. The Company has
completed its initial impairment review and recorded no impairment charges in
its financial statements. However, the Company is exposed to the possibility
that changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment
charges in the future, thus resulting in a potential increase in earnings
volatility. In addition, as a result of
Statement No. 142, the Companys amortization expense is lower as the Company
no longer amortizes goodwill. Assuming
the adoption of FASB No. 142 had occurred at the beginning of 2000, net income
and earnings per share would have been as follows for the three years ended
December 31, 2002 in thousands 50

Included in the Loss from discontinued operations above, are goodwill
impairment losses, net of taxes, of $13 million, related to the sale of the
Michigan John Deere construction equipment stores, and $09 million, related to
the pending sale of the Seguin DD store see Note 3. The Company has completed its impairment review for goodwill related to
continuing operations at December 31, 2002 and recorded no impairment charges
in its financial statements. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No109, Accounting for Income Taxes
SFAS109. SFAS109 requires
recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been included in a companys financial
statements or tax returns. Under this
method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which
the differences are expected to reverse. 51 Revenue Recognition Policies Income on the sale of vehicles and construction equipment
collectively, unit is recognized when the seller and customer execute a
purchase contract, delivery has occurred and there are no significant
uncertainties related to financing or collectibility. Finance income related to the sale of a unit is recognized over
the period of the respective finance contract, based on the effective interest
rate method, if the finance contract is retained by the Company. During 2000, 2001 and 2002, no finance contracts
were retained for any significant length of time by the Company but were
generally sold, with limited recourse, to certain finance companies concurrent
with the sale of the related unit. Gain
or loss is recognized by the Company upon the sale of such finance contracts to
the finance companies, net of a provision for estimated repossession losses and
early repayment penalties. Lease and
rental income is recognized over the period of the related lease or rental
agreement. Parts and services revenue is
earned at the time the Company sells the parts to its customers, or at the time
the Company completes the service work order related to service provided to the
customers unit. Payments received on
prepaid maintenance plans are deferred as a component of accrued expenses and
recognized as income when the maintenance is performed. Stock Options In October 1995, Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
FAS123, was issued.
FAS123 defines a fair value based method of accounting for
employee stock options or similar equity instruments and encourages all
entities to adopt that method of accounting for all of their employee stock
compensation plans. Under the fair
value based method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on
the value of the award and is recognized over the service period of the award,
which is usually the vesting period.
However, FAS123 also allows entities to continue to measure
compensation costs for employee stock compensation plans using the intrinsic
value method of accounting prescribed by APB Opinion No25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees APB25.
Because the Company has elected to continue to follow APB 25,
FAS123 requires disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share
as if the new fair value accounting method was adopted. 52 If the Company had adopted the fair value
accounting method under SFAS123, the Companys net income and earnings
per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below in
thousands, except per share amounts

The fair value of these options was estimated using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model with a risk-free interest rate of 60percent for 2000,
2001 and 2002, volatility factors of 491 and 891 for 2000 and 2001,
respectively, and a range of 792 to 877 for 2002, a dividend yield of
0percent, and an expected option life from zero to seven years for 2000,
2001 and 2002. Advertising Costs The Company charges advertising costs to expenses as incurred. Advertising and marketing expense related to
operations for fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $13 million, $12 million
and $11 million, respectively.
Advertising and marketing expense is included in Selling general and
administrative expense. 53 Statement of Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash and other money
market instruments. The Company
considers any temporary investments that mature in three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents for reporting cash flows. Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 141, Business Combinations FAS 141.
FAS 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting for business
combinations and supersedes APB Opinion No. 16, Business Combinations, and
FASB Statement No. 38, Accounting for Preacquisition Contingencies of
Purchased Enterprises. All business
combinations in the scope of FAS 141 are to be accounted for using the purchase
method. The provisions of FAS 141 apply
to all business combinations initiated after June30, 2001 and applies to
all business combinations accounted for using the purchase method for which the
date of acquisition is July 1, 2001 or later. The Company acquired the assets
of El Paso Trucks and Perfection subsequent to July 1, 2001 applying FAS
141. The application of the new
accounting standard did not have a material impact on the Companys financial
statements. In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations FAS
143. FAS 143 requires entities to
record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the
period in which it is incurred. The
statement requires that the amount recorded as a liability be capitalized by
increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Subsequent to initial measurement, the
liability is accreted to the ultimate amount anticipated to be paid, and is
also adjusted for revisions to the timing or amount of estimated cash
flows. The capitalized cost is
depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity
either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss
upon settlement. FAS 143 became
effective for financial statements beginning January 1, 2003. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact on its financial statements of adopting this statement. In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
AssetsFAS 144. FAS 144 supersedes
FASB Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed of, and the accounting and reporting
provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of
Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary,
Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, and establishes
accounting standards for the impairment and disposal of long-lived assets and
criteria for determining when a long-lived asset is held for sale. FAS 144 removes the requirement to allocate
goodwill to long-lived assets to be tested for impairment, requires that the
depreciable life of a long-lived asset to be abandoned be revised in accordance
with APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, provides that one accounting
model be used for long-lived assets 54 to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or newly
acquired and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include
more disposal transactions. FAS 144
became effective for financial statements beginning January 1, 2002. The
Company has complied with the requirements of FAS 144 in reporting its
discontinued operations in 2002 see Note 3. In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities FAS 146.
FAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or
disposal activity shall be recognized and measured initially at its fair market
value in the period in which the liability is incurred except for a liability
for one-time termination benefits that is incurred over time. The provisions of
FAS 146 became effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after
December 31, 2002. The Company does not
expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on its
financial statements. On December 31, 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and Disclosure FAS 148. FAS 148 amends Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation Statement 123, to provide alternative methods
of transition to Statement 123s fair value method of account for stock-based
employee compensation. FAS 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of
Statement 123 and Accounting Principals Board Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial
Reporting, to require disclosures in the summary of significant accounting
policies of the effects of an entitys accounting policy with respect to
stock-based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share
in annual and interim financial statements. FAS 148 does not amend Statement
123 to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair
value method. The Company adopted the disclosure provisions required in FAS 148
and will provide the necessary disclosures in its future interim reports. 3. DISCONTINUED
OPERATIONS On November 12, 2002, the Company announced that it would sell its
Michigan John Deere construction equipment stores as a result of continuing
deterioration in the Michigan construction equipment market, and its location
in regards to the Companys other operations and its plans for future
expansion. The sale of the Michigan
construction equipment stores was substantially complete at December 31,
2002. Prior to the sale, Michigan
construction equipment stores were part of the Companys Construction Equipment
segment. The Construction Equipment
segment has been restated for all periods presented to exclude the Michigan
stores. On November 12, 2002 the Company decided to discontinue its Retail
segment, which operated three farm and ranch retail stores in Seguin, Hockley
and Denton, Texas. The Company decided
that the Retail segment did not fit into its long-term plans of growing its
core heavy-duty truck and construction equipment businesses. The Denton store was closed during December,
the Hockley store began liquidating inventory during November 55 and completed the liquidation on March 9, 2003 and the Company plans to
sell the Seguin store by December 31, 2003.
As a result of these actions, the Retail segment will no longer be
reported as a separate business segment. As a result of these decisions the Company recognized nonrecurring and
unusual charges, net of income tax benefits, of $83 million $058 per diluted
share in the fourth quarter of 2002.
Following is a discussion that describes the components of the $83
million in charges based on their classification in the Companys consolidated
financial statements. The $83 million in charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002
included charges, net of income tax benefits, of approximately $25 million
related to the Michigan John Deere construction equipment stores sold during
December 2002. The remaining $58
million in charges relate to closing, liquidation and pending sale of Retail
segment stores described above. These charges are included in discontinued
operations in the Companys consolidated statements of income in accordance
with FAS 144. In addition, the results
of operations of these businesses have been classified as discontinued
operations in the Companys consolidated statements of income for all periods
presented, and excluded from business segment information. Similarly, certain assets of these
businesses have been separately identified in the consolidated balance sheet as
being held for sale. The Company
expects to complete the sale of these assets by December 31, 2003. Depreciation and amortization expense are no
longer being recorded with respect to the assets of these businesses in
accordance with FAS 144. These assets
are recorded at estimated fair value less cost to sell at December 31,
2002. Changes in the estimated fair
value will be recorded in future periods as determined. 56 Net sales and earnings loss before income taxes related to the
discontinued businesses were as follows in thousands

4. SUPPLIER AND
CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION Major Suppliers and Dealership Agreements The Company has entered into dealership agreements with various
companies Distributors. These
agreements are nonexclusive agreements that allow the Company to stock, sell at
retail and service trucks, equipment and products of the Distributors in the
Companys defined market. The
agreements allow the Company to use the Distributors name, trade symbols and
intellectual property and expire as follows 
Distributor
Expiration Dates
PACCAR
February 2003 to December 2005
John Deere
Indefinite
These agreements, as well as agreements with various other
Distributors, impose a number of restrictions and obligations on the Company,
including restrictions on a change in control of the Company and the
maintenance of certain required levels of working capital. Violation of these restrictions could result
in the loss of the Companys right to purchase the Distributors products and
use the Distributors trademarks. As of
December31, 2002, the Companys management believes it was in compliance
with all the restrictions and obligations of its dealership agreements. The Company purchases most of its new vehicles and parts from PACCAR,
the maker of Peterbilt trucks and parts, at prevailing prices charged to all
franchised dealers. Sales of new
Peterbilt trucks accounted for 92 percent, 97percent and 98 percent of
the Companys new vehicle sales for the years ended December31, 2000,
2001 and 2002, respectively. The Company purchases most of its new construction equipment and parts
from John Deere at prevailing prices charged to all franchised dealers. Sales of new John Deere equipment accounted
for 86 percent, 85percent and 91percent of the Companys new
equipment sales for the years ended December31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. 58 Primary Lenders The Company purchases its new and used truck and construction equipment
inventories with the assistance of floor plan financing programs offered by
various financial institutions and John Deere.
The financial institution used for truck inventory purchases also
provides the Company with a line of credit that allows borrowings of up to
$13,500,000 and with notes on certain real estate properties. The floor plan agreement with the financial
institution, used for truck inventory purchases, provides that such agreement
may be terminated at the option of the lender with notice of 120 days. The floor plan agreement with one of the financial institutions used
for construction equipment purchases expires in September 2003. Additionally, floor plan financing is
provided by John Deere pursuant to the Companys equipment dealership
agreement. Furthermore, the agreements
also provide that the occurrence of certain events will be considered events of
default. There were no known events of
default as of December 31, 2002. In the
event that the Companys financing becomes insufficient, or its relationship
with the current primary lenders terminates, the Company would need to obtain
similar financing from other sources.
Management believes it can obtain additional floor plan financing or
alternative financing if necessary. The Companys debt agreements include certain restrictive covenants
including maintaining a tangible net worth of at least $150 million and a debt
to tangible net worth ratio of 9 to 1.
The Company was in compliance with these and all debt covenants as of
December 31, 2002. Concentrations of Credit
Risks Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents
and accounts receivable. The Company
places its cash and cash equivalents with what it considers to be quality
financial institutions. At
December31, 2002, the Company had deposits in excess of federal insurance
totaling approximately $240 million.
In January of 2002, a majority of these excess deposits were used to pay
advances outstanding under lines of credit. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are
reduced because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the
Companys customer base, thus, spreading the trade credit risk. A majority of the Companys business,
however, is concentrated in the United States heavy-duty trucking and
construction equipment markets and related aftermarkets. The Company controls credit risk through
credit approvals and by selling certain trade receivables without recourse. Related to the Companys finance contracts,
after the finance contract is entered into, the Company generally sells the
contracts to a third party. The finance
contracts are sold both with and without recourse, but the annual amount of
recourse loss, which can be allocated to the Company, is contractually limited
see Note 15. Historically, bad debt
expense associated with the Companys accounts receivable and finance contracts
has not been significant. 59 5. ACCOUNTS

NOTES PAYABLE AND LINES OF CREDIT Floor Plan Notes Payable Floor plan notes are financing agreements to
facilitate the Companys purchase of new and used trucks and construction equipment. These notes are collateralized by the
inventory purchased and accounts receivable arising from the sale thereof. The Companys floor plan notes have interest
rates at prime less a percentage rate as determined by the finance provider, as
defined in the agreements. The interest
rates applicable to these agreements ranged from approximately 41 percent to
approximately 625percent as of December 31, 2002. The amounts borrowed under these agreements
are due when the related truck or construction equipment inventory collateral
is sold and the sales proceeds are collected by the Company, or in the case of
construction equipment rentals, when the carrying value of the equipment is
reduced. These lines may be modified,
suspended or terminated by the lender as described in Note 4. The Companys floor plan agreement with its
primary truck lender limits the borrowing capacity based on the number of new
and used trucks that may be financed.
As of December 31, 2002, the aggregate amounts of unit capacity for new
and used trucks was 1,485 and 618, respectively, and the availability for new
and used trucks was 528 and 410, respectively. The Companys floor plan agreement with one
of its construction equipment lenders is based on the book value of the Companys
construction equipment inventory. As of
December31, 2002, the aggregate amount of borrowing capacity with this
lender was$200 million, with approximately $57million
outstanding. Additional amounts are
available under the Companys John Deere dealership agreement. At December31, 2002, approximately
$24million was outstanding pursuant to the John Deere dealership
agreement. Amounts of collateral as of December31,

61 Lines of Credit The Company has a separate line-of-credit
agreement with a financial institution that provides for an aggregate maximum
borrowing of $135 million, with advances generally limited to 75percent
of the Companys new parts inventory.
Advances bear interest at prime less one-half of one percent, which was
375 percent on December 31, 2002.
Advances under the line-of-credit agreement are secured by new parts
inventory. The line-of-credit agreement
contains financial covenants. The
Company was in compliance with these covenants on December31, 2002. Either party may terminate the agreement
with 30days written notice. As of
December31, 2001 and 2002, advances outstanding under this line-of-credit
agreement amounted to $120 million and $135 million, respectively. As of December31, 2002, $0 was available
for future borrowings. This line is
discretionary and may be modified, suspended or terminated at the election of
the lender. The Company has four separate secured lines-of-credit that provide
for an aggregate maximum borrowing of $217 million. Advances outstanding under these secured lines-of-credit in
aggregate were $89 million, leaving $128 million available for future
borrowings as of December 31, 2002. 8. LONG-TERM

The interest rates on the Companys variable
interest rate notes are based on LIBOR and the Prime rate on December31,
2002. Interest rates on the notes
ranged from 376 percent to 531 percent on December 31, 2002. Payments on the
notes range from $1,945 62 to $50,000 per month, plus interest. Maturities of these notes range from August
2003 to November 2011. The Companys fixed interest rate notes are
primarily with financial institutions and had interest rates ranging from
approximately 42 percent to 97percent on December31, 2002. Payments on the notes range from $220 to
$34,833 per month, plus interest.
Maturities of these notes range from January 2003 to December 2015. The proceeds from the issuance of the notes
were used primarily to acquire land, buildings and improvements, transportation
equipment and leasing vehicles. The
notes are secured by the assets acquired with the proceeds of such notes. 9. DISCLOSURES
ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The following methods and assumptions were
used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument held by
the Company Current assets and current liabilities
- - The carrying value approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these
items. Long-term debt - The
fair value of the Companys long-term debt is based on secondary market
indicators. Since the Companys debt is
not quoted, estimates are based on each obligations characteristics, including
remaining maturities, interest rate, credit rating, collateral, amortization
schedule and liquidity. The carrying
amount approximates fair value. 10. DEFINED
CONTRIBUTION PLAN The Company has a defined contribution plan
the Rush Plan, which is available to all Company employees and the employees
of certain affiliates. On January 1st
and July1st of every year, each employee who has completed six months of
continuous service is entitled to enter the Rush Plan. Participating employees may contribute from
1percent to 15percent of total gross compensation. For the first 10 percent of an employees
contribution, the Company, at its discretion, contributed an amount equal to
25percent of the employees contributions for those employees with less
than five years of service and contributed an amount equal to 50percent
of the employees contributions for those employees with more than five years
of service. During the years ended
December31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, the Company incurred expenses of
approximately $16 million, $16 million and $15 million, respectively,
related to the Rush Plan. The Company currently does not provide any
postretirement benefits nor does it provide any postemployment benefits. 63 11. LEASES Vehicle Leases The Company leases vehicles primarily over periods ranging from one to
six years under operating lease arrangements.
These vehicles are subleased to customers under various agreements in
its own leasing operation. Generally,
the Company is required to incur all operating costs and pay a minimum rental
and an excess mileage charge based on maximum mileage over the term of the
lease. Vehicle lease expenses for the
years ended December31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, were approximately $56 million 54 million and $50 million, respectively. Minimum rental commitments for non-cancelable vehicle leases in effect

12. STOCK
OPTIONS AND STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS In April 1996, the Board of Directors and shareholders adopted the Rush
Enterprises, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan the Incentive Plan. The Incentive Plan provides for the grant of
stock options which may be nonqualified stock options or incentive stock
options for tax purposes, stock appreciation rights issued independent of or
in tandem with such options SARs, restricted stock awards and performance
awards. The aggregate number of shares of common stock subject to stock options
or SARs that may be granted to any one participant in any year under the
Incentive Plan is 100,000shares of Class A common stock and 100,000
shares of Class B common stock. The
Company has 2,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and 100,000 shares of
Class B Common Stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of any awards granted
under the Companys Incentive Plan. On April8, 1996, the Board of Directors
of the Company declared a dividend of one common share purchase right a Right
for each share of common stock outstanding.
Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company
one share of Class A Common Stock and one share of Class B Common Stock at a
price of $1750 per share the Purchase Price. The Rights are not exercisable
until the distribution date, as defined.
The Rights will expire on April7, 2006 the Final Expiration
Date, unless the Final Expiration Date is extended or unless the Rights are
earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company. In March 2000, 2001 and 2002, the Company
granted options under the Incentive Plan to purchase an aggregate of 148,725,
212,200 and 250,000 shares, respectively, of the Old Common Stock to
employees. Each option granted becomes
exercisable in three annual installments beginning on the third anniversary of
the grant date. The options are
exercisable at a price equal to the fair value of the Companys Old Common
Stock at the grant date. However, each
option has now been divided into two options; one option for 65 the purchase of Class A Common Stock and one
option for the purchase of Class B Common Stock. Each of the options is exercisable at one-half of the fair value
of the Companys Old Common Stock on the grant date. During 2000, the Company granted options
outside of any plan to purchase an aggregate of 168,258 shares of Old Common
Stock to employees. Each option granted
became exercisable in three annual installments beginning on the third
anniversary of the grant date. The
options were also divided into two options, one for Class A Common Stock and
one for Class B Common Stock, and are exercisable at a price equal to one-half
of the fair value of the Companys Old Common Stock at the grant date. During 2001 and 2002, 117,738 and 20,778 of
these options, respectively, were terminated leaving options to purchase
100,000 shares of each Class A and Class B Common Stock on December 31, 2002. During 1997, the Board of Directors and
shareholders adopted the Rush Enterprises, Inc. 1997 Non-Employee Director
Stock Option Plan the Director Plan.
The Director Plan is designed to attract and retain highly qualified
non-employee directors, reserving 300,000 shares of Old Common Stock for
issuance upon exercise of any awards granted under the Plan. Under the terms of this plan, each
non-employee director received options to purchase 10,000 shares of the Old
Common Stock as of the date of adoption or on their respective date of
election, all of which are fully vested and are exercisable immediately, and
expire ten years from the grant date.
During each of the years ended December31, 2001 and 2002, 30,000
options were granted and were exercisable at a price equal to the fair values
of the Companys Old Common Stock on the grant dates. However, each option has
now been divided into two options; one option for the purchase of Class A
Common Stock and one option for the purchase of Class B Common Stock. Each of the options is exercisable at
one-half of the fair value of the Companys Old Common Stock on the grant date. During 2001, the Company granted options outside
any plan to purchase an aggregate of 60,000 shares of Old Common Stock to
non-employee directors, all of which are fully vested and were exercisable
immediately, and expire ten years from the grant date. The options were
exercisable at a price equal to the fair value of the Companys Old Common
Stock on the grant date. However, each
option has now been divided into two options; one option for the purchase of
Class A Common Stock and one options for the purchase of Class B Common
Stock. Each of the options is
exercisable at one-half of the fair value of the Companys Old Common Stock on
the grant date. 66 A summary of the Companys stock option

In October 1997, the Company issued warrants
to purchase an aggregate of 171,875 shares of the Old Common Stock to C. Jim
Stewart Stevenson in connection with the purchase of the assets of the
John Deere construction equipment store.
The warrants were exercisable during the five-year period commencing
October6, 1997, at an exercise price equal to $600 per share. These warrants expired without being
exercised during 2002. 67 In March 1998 and 2000, the Company issued,
to certain employees, warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1875% of the common
stock of Rush Retail Centers, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, for
$375,000. The warrants are exercisable
on various dates between March 2001 and March 2003 and expire 10 years from the
grant date. None of these warrants have
been exercised as of December 31, 2002. 13. EARNINGS PER SHARE Earnings per share for all periods have been
restated to reflect the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 128, Earnings Per Share, SFAS 128 which established standards for
computing and presenting earnings per share EPS for entities with publicly
held common stock or potential common stock.
This statement requires dual presentation of basic and diluted EPS on
the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital
structures. Basic EPS were computed by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted
EPS differs from basic EPS due to the assumed conversions of potentially
dilutive options and warrants that were outstanding during the period. The following is a reconciliation of the
numerators and the denominators of the basic and diluted per-share computations
for net income.

15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is contingently liable to finance
companies for the notes initiated on behalf of such finance companies related
to the sale of trucks and construction equipment. The Companys recourse liability related to such finance
contracts is limited to 15percent to 25percent of the outstanding
amount of each note initiated on the behalf of the finance company with the
aggregate recourse liability for 2001 and 2002 being limited to $14 million in
each year. The Company provides an
allowance for repossession losses. Finance contracts initiated and sold during
the years ended December31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, were $1763 million 1499 million and $1441 million, respectively. The Company is involved in various claims and
legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it is unlikely that the
final outcome of any of the claims or proceedings to which the Company is a
party would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position
or results of operations; however, due to the inherent uncertainty of
litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular
claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on the Companys
results of operations for the fiscal period in which such resolution occurred. On March 6, 2003 the Company defaulted on a
note payable in the amount of $1,750,000.
The Company is currently evaluating its potential defenses to payment of
the note payable. The entire $1,750,000
is included in the current maturities of long-term debt in the Companys
financial statements as of December 31, 2002. 70 16. ACQUISITIONS In August 2001, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of El
Paso Trucks, which consisted of two dealership locations in El Paso, Texas and
Las Cruces, New Mexico. The transaction was valued at $25million with
the purchase price paid in cash. The acquisition has been accounted for as a
purchase, operations of the business acquired have been included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements from the respective date of
acquisition. The purchase price has
been allocated based on the fair values of the assets at the date of
acquisition as follows inthousands

In November 2001, the Company purchased substantially all the assets of
Perfection, which operates an oil and gas up-fitting business, a medium duty
truck accessory and up-fitting business and a parts distribution business in
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The assets acquired were valued at $67million
with a purchase price of $42 million, paid in cash. The acquisition has been accounted for as a
purchase; operations of the business acquired have been included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements from the respective date of acquisition. The purchase price was less than the fair
value of the assets acquired. The
purchase price has been allocated by reducing the property and equipment with a
fair value of $19 million to $0, and inventory with a fair value of $31
million to $25 million, and recording accounts receivable, net of an allowance
for doubtful accounts, at its fair value of $17 million. The following unaudited pro forma summary
presents information as if the El Paso Trucks and Perfection acquisitions had
taken place at the beginning of 2001.
The pro forma information is provided for information purposes
only. It is based on historical
information and does not necessarily reflect the actual results that would have
occurred nor is it necessarily indicative of future results of operations of
the Company. The following summary is

72 18. SEGMENTS The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No131 Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information SFAS131.
This statement requires that public business enterprises report certain
information about operating segments in complete sets of financial statements
of the enterprise and in condensed financial statements of interim periods
issued to shareholders. It also
requires that public business enterprises report certain information about
their products and services, the geographic areas in which they operate, and
their major customers. As mentioned previously, the Company announced in November 2002 its
decision to sell its John Deere construction equipment stores in Michigan, and
discontinue its DD operations. In
connection with this decision, financial information related to the Companys
construction equipment operations in Michigan will not be included in the
Construction Equipment segment below, and, the Retail Segment will no longer be
presented as a separate operating segment.
Following is a brief description of the activities of each of the
Companys business segments The Company has two reportable segments: the Heavy-Duty Truck segment and the Construction Equipment
segment. The Heavy-duty Truck segment operates a regional network of truck
centers that provide an integrated one-stop source for the trucking needs of
its customers, including retail sales of new Peterbilt and used heavy-duty
trucks, after-market parts, service and body shop facilities, and a wide array
of financial services, including the financing of new and used truck purchases,
insurance products and truck leasing and rentals. The Construction Equipment
segment operates full-service John Deere dealerships that serve the Houston,
Texas Metropolitan and surrounding areas.
Dealership operations include the retail sale of new and used equipment,
after-market parts and service facilities, equipment rentals, and the financing
of new and used equipment. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described
in the summary of significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates performance based on income before income
taxes not including extraordinary items. The Company accounts for intersegment sales and transfers as if the
sales or transfers were to third parties, that is, at current market
prices. There were no material
intersegment sales during the years ended December31, 2000, 2001and 2002. 73 The Companys reportable segments are strategic business units that
offer different products and services.
They are managed separately because each business unit requires
different technology and marketing strategies.
Business units were maintained through expansion and acquisitions. The following table contains summarized
information about reportable segment profit or loss and segment assets, for the
years ended December31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 in thousands

Revenues from segments below the quantitative thresholds are
attributable to three operating segments of the Company. Those segments include a tire company, an
insurance company, and a hunting lease operation. None of those segments has ever met any of the quantitative
thresholds for determining reportable segments. 74 19. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In February 2003, the Company acquired the common stock of Orange
County Truck and Trailers, Inc. Orange County, a Peterbilt dealer in
central Florida. The acquisition
provides Rush with the exclusive rights to sell Peterbilt trucks and parts from
three new locations in central Florida, including Orlando, Haines City, and
Tampa. The transaction was valued at
approximately $54 million unaudited, with the purchase price paid in cash. 75 Item 1
