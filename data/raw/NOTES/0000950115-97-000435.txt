and Subsidiaries
Wyomissing, Pennsylvania
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Penn National
Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Penn National
Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries at December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1996 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.                             /s/ BDO SEIDMAN, LLP

Accounting
Policies
Principles of Consolidation and Reorganization
The consolidated financial statements include the following entities of Penn
National Gaming, Inc. prior to the reorganization, as described below, and which
were affiliated through common ownership and control.
Mountainview Thoroughbred Racing Association Mountainview
Pennsylvania National Turf Club, Inc. Turf Club
PNRC Reading, Inc. An S Corporation
PNRC Chambersburg, Inc. An S Corporation
PNRC Limited Partnership
Carlino Family Partnership
Penn National Gaming, Inc.,
formerly called PNRC Corp. An S Corporation
The consolidated financial statements for the periods prior to the
reorganization have been prepared as if the entities had operated as a single
consolidated group assuming that the reorganization had taken place. After the
reorganization and the current year business acquisition see Note 2, the
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Penn National Gaming,
Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries collectively referred to as the
Company. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.
Reorganization
The Company completed an initial public offering on May 25, 1994 by selling
4,500,000 shares of its common stock.
On April 11, 1994, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of
reorganization, pursuant to which, on May 24, 1994: 1 Penn National Gaming,
Inc. Parent acquired all of the outstanding stock of Mountainview, Turf
Club, PNRC Reading, Inc. and PNRC Chambersburg, Inc., 2 Penn National Gaming,
Inc. acquired the limited partners' interests in PNRC Limited Partnership and
all of the partnership interests in Carlino Family Partnership, and these
partnerships were liquidated into the Company. In exchange for the stock and
assets acquired in the transactions, the Company issued 8,400,000 shares of its
common stock. Pursuant to the reorganization, Turf Club, Mountainview, PNRC
Reading, Inc. and PNRC Chambersburg, Inc. became wholly-owned subsidiaries of
the Parent. Subsequent to the
39          Penn National Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements reorganization, the Company merged PNRC Reading, Inc. and PNRC Chambersburg,
Inc. into Mountainview in accordance with a statutory merger, leaving Turf Club
and Mountainview as the only subsidiaries of the Company.
The transaction was treated similar to a pooling of interests and the exchange
of stock and partnership interests was a tax-free exchange.
Description of Business
The Company, which began operations in 1972, provides pari-mutuel wagering
opportunities on both live and simulcast thoroughbred and harness horse races at
two racetracks and six off-track wagering facilities OTWs located
principally in Eastern and Central Pennsylvania. Prior to the consummation of
the acquisition of Pocono Downs see Note 2, the Company owned and operated
Penn National Race Course located outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania the
Thoroughbred Track, and four OTWs in Chambersburg, Lancaster, Reading and
York, Pennsylvania. On November 27, 1996, the Company consummated the Pocono
Downs Acquisition, and as a result acquired Pocono Downs Racetrack, located near
Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania the Harness Track, and OTWs in Allentown and
Erie, Pennsylvania.
On January 15, 1997, a joint venture, in which the Company has reached an
agreement to hold an 89% interest, acquired substantially all of the assets
relating to Charles Town Races, a thoroughbred racing facility in Jefferson
County, West Virginia see Note 2. The Company expects to refurbish the Charles
Town facility as an entertainment complex that will feature gaming machines,
live racing, dining and simulcast wagering.
The Company conducts wagering at its tracks and its OTWs on thoroughbred and
harness races which it runs at its tracks and on thoroughbred and harness races
simulcast from other racetracks. The Company also simulcasts its races for
wagering at other racetracks and OTWs, including all Pennsylvania racetracks and
OTWs and locations outside Pennsylvania. Wagering on Company races and races
simulcast from other racetracks also occurs through the Company telephone
account betting network.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of leasehold
improvements are computed by the straight-line method at rates adequate to
allocate the cost of the applicable assets over their estimated useful lives.
Depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and
1994 amounted to $1,301,000, $814,000 and $612,000, respectively.
The excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired is being amortized on
the straight-line method over a forty year period. Amortization expense for
1996, 1995 and 1994 amounted to $98,000, $67,000 and $67,000, respectively. The
Company evaluates the recoverability of the goodwill quarterly, or more
frequently whenever events and circumstances warrant revised estimates, and
considers whether the goodwill should be completely or partially written off or
the amortization period accelerated.
The Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 121 SFAS 121 Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of during the year ended
December 31, 1995. SFAS 121 establishes accounting standards for the impairment
of long-lived assets, certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to
those assets to be held and used and for long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangibles to be disposed of. The Company reviews the carrying
values of its long-lived and identifiable intangible assets for possible
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable based on undiscounted
estimated future operating cash flows. As of December 31, 1996, the Company has
determined that no impairment has occurred.
Income Taxes
Prior to the reorganization, certain entities included within these financial
statements were partnerships and S corporations. Therefore, no provision had
been made for income taxes since such taxes, if any, were the liabilities of the
individual partners and shareholders.
The Company has adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109. SFAS
109 requires a company to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a
43          Penn National Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements company financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax
liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the
financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities
using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are
expected to reverse.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all cash balances and highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Net Income Per Common Share
Net income and supplemental pro forma net income per share are calculated by
dividing net income or supplemental pro forma net income by the weighted average
number of common stock outstanding see Note 8 adjusted by the dilutive effect
of common stock equivalents, which consist of stock options using the treasury
stock method and warrants. All net income per share calculations reflect all
stock splits see Note 10.
Deferred Financing Costs
Deferred financing costs, which were incurred by the Company in connection with
the new credit facility see Note 3, are charged to operations as additional
interest expense over the life of the underlying indebtedness using the interest
method adjusted to give effect to any early repayments.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to credit risk
consist of cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
The Company policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one
financial institution and place investments with financial institutions
evaluated as being creditworthy, or in short-term less than seven days money
market and tax free bond funds which are exposed to minimal interest rate and
credit risk. At December 31, 1996 and 1995, the Company had bank deposits which
exceeded federally insured limits by approximately $499,000, and $248,000
respectively, and money market and tax free bond funds of approximately
$2,553,000 and $6,400,000, respectively. Concentration of credit risk, with
respect to accounts receivable, is limited due to the Company credit
evaluation process. The Company does not require collateral from its customers.
The Company customer base consists principally of other race tracks and OTWs.
Historically, the Company has not incurred any significant credit related
losses.
44          Penn National Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fair Value of Financial Instruments
As of December 31, 1996 and 1995, the following methods and assumptions were
used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which
it is practical to estimate   Cash and Cash Equivalents: The carrying amount approximates the fair value
due to the short-term maturity of the cash equivalents.
Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations: The fair value of the
Company long-term debt and capital lease obligations is estimated based
on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the
current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining
maturities. The carrying amount approximates fair value since the Company
interest rates approximate current interest rates.
Prepaid Acquisition Costs
Prepaid acquisition costs, which were incurred by the Company substantially in
connection with the Charles Town Acquisition see Note 2, will be included in
the purchase price of the Charles Town Acquisition and allocated to the
appropriate assets.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2. Acquisitions
Pocono Downs Acquisition
On November 27, 1996, the Company purchased all of the capital stock of The
Plains Company and the limited partnership interests in The Plains Company
affiliated entities together, Pocono Downs for an aggregate purchase price
of $482 million plus acquisition-related fees and expenses of $730,000 the
Pocono Downs Acquisition. Pocono Downs conducts live harness racing at the
harness racetrack located near Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania the Harness Track,
export simulcasting of Harness Track races to locations throughout the United
States, pari-mutuel wagering at the Harness Track and at OTWs in Allentown and
Erie, Pennsylvania on Pocono Downs races and on import simulcast races from
other racetracks, and telephone account wagering on live and import simulcast
races.
The Pocono Downs Acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. Accordingly, a portion of the purchase price was allocated to the
net assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. In accordance with
SFAS 109, the Company recorded an additional increase to goodwill of
approximately $97 million and a corresponding increase to a deferred tax
liability, representing the difference between the financial and tax bases of
certain assets acquired.
The results of operations of Pocono Downs have been included in the Company
consolidated financial statements since the effective date of the acquisition.
The balance of the purchase price was recorded as cost over net assets acquired
as goodwill, approximately $104 million, and is being amortized over forty
years on a straight-line basis. The Company used its credit facility see 
Note 3 and cash of Pocono Downs to fund the acquisition.                    46          Penn National Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The following unaudited pro forma financial information for the Company gives

obtained in the future.
In addition, pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, the Company will
be required to pay the sellers of Pocono Downs an additional $10 million if,
within five years after the consummation of the Pocono Downs Acquisition,
Pennsylvania authorizes any additional form of gaming in which the Company may
participate. The $10 million payment would be payable in annual installments of
$2 million for five years, beginning on the date that the Company first offers
such additional form of gaming.
Charles Town Acquisition
On February 26, 1996, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement the
Charles Town Joint Venture with Bryant Development Company Bryant, the
holder of an option to purchase substantially all of the assets of Charles Town
Racing Limited Partnership and Charles Town Races, Inc. together, Charles
Town relating to the Charles Town Race Track and Shenandoah Downs together,
the Charles Town Facility in Jefferson County, West Virginia. In connection
with the Charles Town Joint Venture
47          Penn National Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements agreement, Bryant assigned the option to the Charles Town Joint Venture. In
November 1996, the Charles Town Joint Venture and Charles Town entered into an
amended and restated option agreement. On November 5, 1996, Jefferson County,
West Virginia approved a referendum permitting installation of gaming machines
at the Charles Town Facility. On January 15, 1997, the Charles Town Joint
Venture acquired substantially all of the assets of Charles Town the Charles
Town Acquisition for approximately $165 million plus acquisition-related fees
and expenses of approximately $16 million. Pursuant to the original operating
agreement governing the Charles Town Joint Venture, the Company held an 80%
ownership interest in the Charles Town Joint Venture and was obligated to
contribute 80% of the purchase price of the Charles Town Acquisition and 80% of
the cost of refurbishing the Charles Town Facility. In fact, the Company
contributed 100% of the purchase price of the Charles Town Acquisition and
expects to contribute 100% of the cost of refurbishing the Charles Town
Facility. The Company has reached an agreement with Bryant, pursuant to which
the parties have agreed to amend the operating agreement to increase the
Company ownership interest to 89% and decrease Bryant ownership interest to
11%. In addition, the amendment will provide that the entire amount the Company
has contributed, and will contribute, to the Charles Town Joint Venture for the
acquisition and refurbish ment of the Charles Town Facility would be treated, as
between the parties, as a loan to the Charles Town Joint Venture from the
Company. The proposed changes in the ownership of the Charles Town Venture are
subject to the review of applicable West Virginia racing and regulatory
authorities. The Charles Town Acquisition was accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting. Accordingly, a portion of the purchase price was allocated
to the net assets acquired based on their estimated fair values.
The Charles Town Joint Venture has developed plans for the refurbishment of the
Charles Town Facility as an entertainment complex that will feature live racing,
dining, simulcast wagering and the installation of gaming machines; the
estimated cost of the refurbishment is approximately $16 million exclusive of
the costs of gaming machines.
48          Penn National Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Effective June 4, 1996, the Charles Town Joint Venture entered into a Loan
and Security Agreement with Charles Town. The Loan and Security Agree
ment provided for a working capital line of credit in the amount of $1,250,000
and a requisite reduction of the purchase price under the option, by $160 for
each dollar borrowed under that line. Upon consummation of the Charles
Town Acquisition, Charles Town Races, Inc. repaid the loan.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Credit Facilities
At December 31, 1996, the Company was contingently obligated under letters of
credit with face amounts aggregating $1,436,000. The $1,436,000 consisted of
$1,336,000 relating to the horsemens' account balances and $100,000 for
Pennsylvania pari-mutuel taxes.
In November 1996, the Company entered into an agreement with a bank group which
provides an aggregate of $75 million of credit facilities Credit Facility
Agreement. Simultaneously with the closing of the Credit Facility Agreement,
the Company repaid amounts outstanding under its old facility and replaced it.
The credit facilities consist of two term loan facilities of $47 million and
$23 million together, the Term Loans which were used for the Pocono Downs
and Charles Town acquisitions, respectively, and which will be used for a
portion of the cost of refurbishment of the Charles Town Facility, and a
revolving credit facility of $5 million together, the Loans. The credit
facilities mature in November 2001. The Loans are secured by substantially all
of the assets of the Company. The Credit Facility Agreement provides for certain
covenants, including those of a financial nature.
Funding of the first $47 million Term Loan facility took place on November 27,
1996 in conjunction with the Pocono Downs acquisition. On January 15, 1997, the
Charles Town Acquisition was consummated and, in accordance with the terms of
the Credit Facility Agreement, the second $23 million Term Loan was made
available for utilization by the Company. The Company borrowed $165 million of
the $23 million Term Loan on January 15, 1997.
The $5 million revolving credit facility the Revolving Facility includes a
$2 million sublimit for standby letters of credit for periods of up to twelve
months. Up to $3 million of the Revolving Facility was made available on
November 27, 1996. The remaining $2 million was made available upon completion
of the Charles Town Acquisition on January 15, 1997.                    50          Penn National Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements At the Company option, the Loans may be maintained from time to time as Base
Rate Loans, which shall bear interest at the highest of: 1 1/2 of 1% in excess
of the federal reserve reported certificate of deposit rate, 2 the rate that
the bank group announces from time to time as its prime lending rate and 3 1/2
of 1% in excess of the federal funds rate plus an applicable margin of up to 2%.
The Loans may also be maintained as Reserve Adjusted Eurodollar Loans, which
bear interest at a rate tied to a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of
up to 3%.
Mandatory repayments of the Term Loans and the Revolving Facility are required
in an amount equal to a percentage of the net cash proceeds from any issuance or
incurrence of equity or funded debt by the Company, that percentage to be
dependent upon the then outstanding balances of the Term Loans and the Revolving
Facility and the Company leverage ratio; however, the Credit Facility
Agreement, as amended, permitted the Company to retain up to the first $8
million of proceeds from an offering of the Company equity securities.
Mandatory repayments of varying percentages are also required in the event of
either asset sales in excess of stipulated amounts or defined excess cash flow.

On December 11, 1996, GTECH Corporation GTECH commenced an action in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia against
Charles Town, the Company, Penn National Gaming of West Virginia, Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company, and Bryant. The complaint filed by GTECH
alleges that Charles Town and AmTote International, Inc. AmTote were
parties to an October 20, 1994 agreement the AmTote Agreement, pursuant to
which AmTote was allegedly granted an exclusive right to install and operate a
video lottery system at the Charles Town Facility. When the AmTote Agreement
was entered into, AmTote was a subsidiary of GTECH; GTECH has since divested
itself of AmTote, but is purportedly the assignee of certain of AmTote rights
under the AmTote Agreement pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement
dated February 22, 1996. The complaint seeks i preliminary and permanent
injunctive relief enjoining Charles Town, Bryant, the Company and its subsidiary
from consummating the Charles Town Acquisition or any similar transaction unless
the purchasing party explicitly accepts and assumes the AmTote Agreement, ii a
declaratory judgment that the AmTote Agreement is valid and binding, that GTECH
has the right to be the exclusive installer, operator, provider and servicer of
a video lottery system at the Charles Town Facility and that any party buying
the stock or assets of Charles Town must accept and assume the AmTote Agreement
and recognize such rights of GTECH thereunder, iii compensatory damages, iv
legal fees and costs and v such other further legal and equitable relief as
the court deems just and appropriate. On December 23, 1996, the court denied
GTECH motion to preliminarily enjoin the Company from consummating the Charles
Town Acquisition unless it accepts and assumes the AmTote Agreement. The court
noted that GTECH may pursue its claim for damages and, if warranted, pursue
other injunctive relief in the future. The Company consummated the Charles Town
Acquisition on January 15, 1997. On January 13, 1997, Charles Town filed a
motion to dismiss GTECH complaint. As of March 17, 1997, the court has not yet
ruled on this motion. The Company believes the allegations of the complaint to
be without merit and intends to contest the action vigorously.

Stock Options and Warrants
In April 1994, the Company Board of Directors and shareholders adopted and
approved the Stock Option Plan Plan. The Plan permits the grant of options
to purchase up to 1,290,000 shares of Common Stock, subject to antidilution
adjustments, at a price per share no less than 100% of the fair market value of
the Common Stock on the date the option is granted with respect to incentive
stock options only. The price would be no less than 110% of fair market value in
the case of an incentive stock option granted to any individual who owns more
than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of outstanding stock.
The Plan provides for the granting of both incentive stock options intended to
qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and
non-qualified stock options which do not so qualify. Unless the Plan is
terminated earlier by the Board of Directors, the Plan will terminate in April
2004.
Stock options that expire between May 26, 2001 and October 23, 2006 have been
granted to officers and directors to purchase Common Stock at prices ranging
from $333 to $1763 per share.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements During 1995, the FASB adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123 SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which has
recognition provisions that establish a fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation plans and established fair value as the
measurement basis for transactions in which an entity acquires goods or services
from nonemployees in exchange for equity instruments. SFAS 123 also has certain
disclosure provisions. Adoption of the recognition provisions of SFAS 123 with
regard to these transactions with nonemployees was required for all such
transactions entered into after December 15, 1995, and the Company adopted these
provisions as required. The recognition provision with regard to the fair value
based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans is
optional. Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employers APB 25 uses what is referred to as an intrinsic value
based method of accounting. The Company has decided to continue to apply APB 25
for its stock-based employee compensation arrangements. Accordingly, no
compensation cost has been recognized. Had compensation cost for the Company
employee stock option plan been determined based on the fair value at the grant
date for awards under the plan consistent with the method of SFAS 123, the
Company net income and net income per share would have been reduced to the pro
