REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Rush Enterprises, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rush
Enterprises, Inc. a Texas corporation, and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1996 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1997. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Rush Enterprises, Inc., and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1997, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                        ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP San Antonio, Texas

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1995, 1996 AND 1997
1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS Rush Enterprises, Inc. the Company, was incorporated in June 1996 under the
laws of the State of Texas.
The Company, founded in 1965, now operates a Heavy Duty Truck segment and a
Construction Equipment segment. The Heavy Duty Truck segment operates a regional
network of 17 truck centers that provide an integrated one-stop source for the
trucking needs of its customers, including retail sales of new Peterbilt and
used heavy-duty trucks; parts, service and body shop facilities; and financial
services, including assisting in the financing of new and used truck purchases,
insurance products and truck leasing and rentals. The Company truck centers
are located in areas on or near major highways in Texas, California, Colorado,
Oklahoma and Louisiana. The Construction Equipment segment, formed during 1997,
operates a full-service John Deere dealership that serves the Houston, Texas
Metropolitan and surrounding areas. Dealership operations include the retail
sale of new and used equipment, after-market parts and service facilities,
equipment rentals, and the financing of new and used equipment see note 20.
In February 1994, the Company acquired a 90 percent interest in South Coast
Peterbilt South Coast and Translease-California. In August 1995, the Company
purchased the remaining 10 percent minority interest see note 18.
In March 1995, the Company sold its Rush Pontiac-GMC dealership to a third
party. Rush Pontiac-GMC sold passenger automobiles and small- to medium-used
trucks to the general public. The results of operations of this division have
been presented as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 1995
see Note 4.
In December 1995, the Company purchased substantially all the assets of Kerr
Consolidated, Inc. Kerr, and began operations of Oklahoma Trucks, Tulsa Trucks
and Translease-Oklahoma. Kerr primary line of business is the sale of new
Peterbilt and used heavy-duty trucks, parts, leasing and service see note 18.
In March 1997, the Company purchased substantially all the assets of Denver

and rental of new John Deere and used construction equipment, parts and service.
As part of the corporate reorganization on June 12, 1996 see Note 3,
Associated Acceptance, Inc. Associates, came under the control of the Company
and, thus, 100 percent of the financial position and results of operations of
Associates has been included in the Company consolidated financial statements
as of December 31, 1996 and 1997. The Company has restated 1994 and 1995
shareholders' equity to reflect Associates as part of the Company consolidated
shareholders' equity consistent with the 1996 and 1997 financial statement
presentation.
The restatement was not material to the Company shareholders' equity.
All significant interdivision and intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period amounts have been
reclassified for comparative purposes.                    58

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Estimates in Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined
by specific identification for new and used truck and construction equipment
inventory and by utilizing the first-in, first-out methods for tires, parts and
accessories.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are being depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the useful life of the improvement, or
the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Both the straight-line and double
declining-balance methods of depreciation are used. The cost, accumulated
depreciation and amortization and estimated useful lives are summarized as

Allowance for Doubtful Receivables
and Repossession Losses
The Company provides an allowance for doubtful receivables and repossession
losses after considering historical loss experience and other factors, which
might affect the collectibility of accounts receivable and the ability of
customers to meet their obligations on finance contracts sold by the Company.
Other Assets
Other assets primarily consist of goodwill related to acquisitions, of
approximately $28 million and $127 million, as of December 31, 1996 and 1997,
respectively , and long-term deposits. The goodwill is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of 30 years. Accumulated
amortization at December 31, 1996 and 1997, was approximately $140,000 and
$483,000, respectively. Periodically, the Company assesses the appropriateness
of the asset valuations of goodwill and the related amortization period.                    59

Income Taxes
Effective with the corporate reorganization on June 12, 1996 see Note 3, the
Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109. SFAS 109 requires recognition
of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences
of events that have been included in a company financial statements or tax
returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined
based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets
and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the years in
which the differences are expected to reverse.
Revenue Recognition Policies
Income on the sale of vehicles and construction equipment collectively,
unitis recognized when the seller and customer execute a purchase contract
and there are no significant uncertainties related to financing or delivery.
Finance income related to the sale of a unit is recognized over the period of
the respective finance contract on the effective interest rate method if the
finance contract is retained by the Company. During 1995, 1996 and 1997, no
finance contracts were retained for any significant length of time by the
Company but were generally sold, with limited recourse, to certain finance
companies concurrent with the sale of the related unit. Gain or loss is
recognized by the Company upon the sale of such finance contracts to the finance
companies, net of a provision for estimated repossession losses and early
repayment penalties. Lease and rental income is recognized over the period of
the related lease or rental agreement. Parts and services revenue is earned at
the time the Company sells the parts to its customers, or at the time the
Company completes the service work order related to service provided to the
customer unit.
Statement of Cash Flows
Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash and other money market
instruments. The Company considers any temporary investments that mature in
three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents for reporting cash
flows.
Noncash activities during the periods indicated were as follows in thousands                                   Year Ended December 31

Assignment of debt in connection with the disposal of property
and equipment                            -     -     1,061 New Accounting Pronouncements
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 125, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, in June 1996 SFAS 125.
This statement provides accounting and reporting standards for, among other
things, the transfer and servicing of financial assets, such as factoring
receivables with recourse. This statement is effective for transfers and
servicing of financial assets occurring after December 31, 1996, and is to be
applied prospectively. The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 127, Deferral of the Effective Date of
Certain Provisions of FASB Statement No. 125 SFAS 127. SFAS 127 moves forward
some, but not all, of the provisions of SFAS 125 to December 31, 1997. Earlier
or retroactive application is not permitted. The Company believes the adoption
of this statement will not have an impact on the financial condition or results
of operations of the Company.                    60

3. INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING AND
CORPORATE REORGANIZATION The Company filed a Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for an underwritten offering of 2,875,000 shares of common stock,
including underwriters' overallotment option, which became effective on June 12,
1996 the Offering. The Company used the net proceeds of the Offering to retire
certain debt obligations, fund potential acquisition opportunities which may
arise in the future and for general corporate purposes.
As part of the Offering on June 12, 1996, the Company terminated its S
corporation federal tax election and was subject to federal and certain state
income taxes from that date forward. On June 12, 1996, the Company paid the S
corporation shareholder approximately $86 million representing the
undistributed accumulated earnings of the S corporation prior to June 12, 1996.
Following the offering, there were 6,625,000 common shares outstanding,
including 3,750,000 owned by the shareholder of the predecessor S corporation.
The weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding as of December
31, 1996 and 1997, was 5,590,270 and 6,643,730, respectively.
Dividends declared, paid or payable for the years ended December 31, 1995 and
1996, were related to the Company sole shareholder prior to the reorganization
and Offering.
As part of the reorganization, the Company acquired, as a wholly owned
subsidiary, a managing general agent the MGA to manage all of the operations
of Associated Acceptance, Inc. AA. The MGA is responsible for funding the
operations of AA, directing the use of AA assets and incurring liabilities on
AA behalf in exchange for the MGA receiving any and all net income of AA. W.
Marvin Rush, the sole shareholder of AA, is prohibited from the sale or transfer
of the capital stock of AA under the MGA agreement, except as designated by the
Company. Therefore, the financial position and operations of AA have been
included as part of the Company consolidated financial position and results of
operations.  4. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In March 1995, the Company sold its Pontiac-GMC Truck division and, therefore,
has accounted for these operations as discontinued operations. Under the terms
of the sales agreement, the Buyer purchased the new car and truck inventory. The
Company received approximately $3,601,000 for the sale of the dealership.
The results of the division operations and cash flows have been classified as
discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 1995 in the consolidated
statements of income and cash flows. All assets and liabilities of the
Pontiac-GMC Truck division were sold prior to December 31, 1995.
Sales revenues applicable to Rush Pontiac-GMC was $6,435,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1995.                    61

5. PRO FORMA INFORMATION UNAUDITED Pro Forma Income From Continuing Operations and
Income From Continuing Operations Per Share Unaudited
Pro forma income from continuing operations and pro forma income from continuing
operations per share have been determined assuming that the Company had been
taxed as a C corporation for federal and certain state income tax purposes since
January 1, 1995.
Pro forma income from continuing operations per share had been computed using
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding of the Company.
Weighted average common shares for all periods presented prior to the Offering
have been increased by 547,400 shares to reflect the number of shares that would
have to have been sold at the offering price per share to repay an approximate
$6,000,000 distribution of undistributed S corporation earnings as of December
31, 1995.
6. SUPPLIER AND CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION Major Suppliers and Dealership Agreements
The Company has entered into dealership agreements with various companies
Distributors. These agreements are nonexclusive agreements that allow the
Company to stock, sell at retail and service trucks and products of the
Distributors in the Company defined market. The agreements allow the Company
to use the Distributor name, trade symbols and intellectual property and
expire as follows Distributor       Expiration Dates
PACCAR         March 2000 to
October 2000
GMC           October 2000
Volvo          March 2000
John Deere       Indefinite These agreements impose a number of restrictions and obligations on the Company,
including restrictions on a change in control of the Company and the maintenance
of certain required levels of working capital. Violation of such restrictions
could result in the loss of the Company right to purchase the Distributor
products and use the Distributor trademarks. As of December 31, 1997, the
Company management believes it was in compliance with all the restrictions of
its dealership agreements.
The Company purchases most of its new vehicles and parts from PACCAR, the maker
of Peterbilt trucks and parts, at prevailing prices charged to all franchised
dealers. Sales of new Peterbilt trucks accounted for 95 and 98 percent of the
Company new vehicle sales for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997,
respectively.
The Company purchases most of its new construction equipment and parts from John
Deere, at prevailing prices charged to all franchised dealers. Sales of new John
Deere equipment accounted for 99 percent of the Company new equipment sales
for the year ended December 31, 1997.
Primary Lenders
The Company purchases its new and used truck and construction equipment
inventories with the assistance of floor plan financing programs offered by
various financial institutions and John Deere. The financial institution used
for truck inventory purchases also provides the Company with a line of credit
which allows borrowings of up to $8,000,000 and other variable interest rate
notes. The loan agreement with the financial institution, used for truck
inventory purchases, provides that such agreement may be terminated at the
option of the lender with notice of 120 days.
The loan agreement with the financial institution used primarily for
construction equipment purchases expires in September 1998. Additionally, 
financing is provided by John Deere pursuant to the Company equipment
dealership agreement. Furthermore, the agreements also provide that the
occurrence of certain events will be considered events of default. In the event
that the Company financing becomes insufficient, or its relationship
terminates                     62
63
with the current primary lenders, the Company would need to obtain similar
financing from other sources. Management believes it can obtain additional floor
plan financing or alternative financing if necessary. See Note 9.
Concentrations of Credit Risks
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents
and accounts receivable.
The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with what it considers to be
quality financial institutions. At December 31, 1997, the Company had deposits
in excess of federal insurance totaling approximately $1,382,000.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are reduced
because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the Company
customer base, thus, spreading the trade credit risk. A majority of the
Company business, however, is concentrated in the United States heavy-duty
trucking and construction equipment markets and related aftermarkets. The
Company controls credit risk through credit approvals and by selling certain
trade receivables without recourse. Related to the Company finance contracts,
after the finance contract is entered into, the Company generally sells the
contracts to a third party. The finance contracts are sold both with and without
recourse, but the annual amount of recourse losses which can be put to the
Company is contractually limited. See note 17. Historically, bad debt expense
associated with the Company accounts receivable and finance contracts has not
been material.
7. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE The Company accounts receivable, net, consisted of the following: in 
thousands.                                  December 31,

9. FLOOR PLAN NOTES PAYABLE AND LINES OF CREDIT Floor Plan Notes Payable
Floor plan notes are financing agreements to facilitate the Company purchase
of new and used trucks and construction equipment. These notes are
collateralized by the inventory purchased and accounts receivable arising from
the sale thereof. The Company floor plan notes have interest rates at prime
less a percentage rate as determined by the finance provider, as defined in the
agreements. The interest rates applicable to these agreements were 775 to 80
percent as of December 31, 1997. The amounts borrowed under these agreements are
due when the related truck or construction equipment inventory collateral is
sold and the sales proceeds are collected by the Company, or in the case of
construction equipment rentals, when the carrying value of the equipment is
reduced. These lines may be modified, suspended, or terminated by the lender as
described in footnote 6.
The Company floor plan agreement with its primary truck lender limits the
borrowing capacity based on the number of new and used trucks that may be
financed. As of December 31, 1997, the aggregate amounts of unit capacity for
new and used trucks are 1,046 and 422, respectively, and the availability for
new and used trucks is 704 and 192, respectively.
The Company floor plan agreement with its primary construction equipment
lender is based on the book value of the Company construction equipment
inventory. As of December 31, 1997, the aggregate amount of borrowing capacity
with the Company primary lender, was $20 million, with approximately $194
million outstanding. Additional amounts are available under the Company John
Deere dealership agreement. At December 31, 1997, approximately $76 million was
outstanding pursuant to the John Deere dealership agreement.
Amounts of collateral as of December 31, 1997, are as follows in thousands                                 
Inventories, new and used vehicles and construction
equipment at cost based on specific identification        $49,692

Total                  $ 65,734
Floor plan notes payable                       $ 63,268
Lines of Credit
The Company has a separate line-of-credit agreement with a financial institution
which provides for an aggregate maximum borrowing of $8,000,000, with advances
generally limited to 75 percent of new parts inventory. Advances bear interest
at prime. Advances under the line-of-credit agreement are secured by new parts
inventory. The line-of-credit agreement contains financial covenants. The
Company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 1997. Either
party may terminate the agreement with 30 days written notice. As of December
31, 1996 and 1997, advances outstanding under the various line-of-credit
agreements amounted to $20,000. As of December 31, 1997, $7,980,000 was
available for future borrowings. This line is discretionary and may be modified,
suspended or terminated at the election of the lender.                    64

Note payable to shareholder is a short-term note that is payable on demand and
bears interest equal to one percent per annum less than the rate of interest
received by the Company under its agreement to deposit overnight funds in
interest bearing accounts with one of the Company floor plan lenders.
As of December 31, 1997, debt maturities are as follows in thousands                 
1998               $ 7,909

2001                 3,830
2002                 7,167
Thereafter              7,368
$ 30,651 The Company variable interest rate notes are with one of the Company primary
lenders and have an interest rate of prime, which was 850 percent at December
31, 1997. Monthly payments of these notes range from $2,708 to $7,917, plus
interest. These notes mature in 2011.
The Company fixed interest rate notes are primarily with financial
institutions and have interest rates ranging from 70 percent to 105 percent at
December 31, 1997. Monthly payments on the notes range from $432 to $44,000,
plus interest. Maturities of these notes range from March 1998 to October 2012.
The proceeds from the issuance of the variable and fixed rate notes were used
primarily to acquire land, buildings and improvements, transportation equipment
and leased vehicles. The notes are secured by the assets acquired by the
proceeds of such notes.
11.  DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS In December 1991, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 SFAS
107, Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments, was issued. SFAS
107 requires disclosures of the fair value of financial instruments. The
following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each
class of financial instrument held by the Company     Current assets and current liabilities - The carrying value
approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these items.                    65
66
Long-term debt - The fair value of the Company long-term debt is
based on secondary market indicators. Since the Company debt is not
quoted, estimates are based on each obligation characteristics,
including remaining maturities, interest rate, credit rating,
collateral, amortization schedule and liquidity. The carrying amount
approximates fair value.
12. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION PLANS The Company has a defined contribution pension plan the Rush Plan which is
available to all Company employees and the employees of certain affiliates,
except employees of South Coast, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As of
December 31 of every year, each employee who has completed one year of
continuous service is entitled to enter the Rush Plan. Participating employees
may contribute from 2 percent to 10 percent of total gross compensation. The
Company, at its discretion, contributed an amount equal to 25 percent of the
employees' contributions. During the years ended December 31, 1995, 1996 and
1997, the Company incurred expenses of approximately $127,000, $166,000 and
$215,000, respectively, related to the Rush Plan.
South Coast also has a defined contribution pension plan the South Coast Plan
which is available to all employees of South Coast. As of January 1 and July 1
of every year, each employee who has completed one year of continuous service is
entitled to enter the South Coast Plan. Participating employees do not
contribute. South Coast, at its discretion, contributes an amount equal to 25
percent of the employees' compensation. During the years ended December 31,
1995, 1996 and 1997, South Coast incurred expenses of approximately $166,000 185,000 and $151,000, respectively, related to the South Coast Plan.
The Company currently does not provide any postretirement benefits other than
pensions nor does it provide any postemployment benefits.
13. LEASES Vehicle Leases
The Company leases vehicles primarily over periods ranging from one to six years
under operating lease arrangements. This equipment is subleased to customers
under various agreements in its own leasing operation. Generally, the Company is
required to incur all operating costs and pay a minimum rental and an excess
mileage charge based on maximum mileage over the term of the lease. Vehicle
lease expenses for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997, were
approximately $3,221,000, $4,354,000 and $4,915,000, respectively.

Customer Vehicle Leases
A Company division leases both owned and leased vehicles to customers primarily
over periods of one to six years under operating lease arrangements. The leases
require a minimum rental and a contingent rental based on mileage. Rental income
during the years ended December 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997, consisted of minimum
payments of approximately $5,262,000, $7,443,000 and $7,978,000, respectively,
and contingent rentals of approximately $1,372,000, $2,018,000 and $1,940,000,
respectively. Minimum lease payments to be received for noncancelable leases and
subleases in effect at December 31, 1997, are as follows in thousands

14. STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS In October 1995, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123, was issued. SFAS 123
defines a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options or
similar equity instruments and encourages all entities to adopt that method of
accounting for all of their employee stock compensation plans. Under the fair
value based method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the
value of the award and is recognized over the service period of the award, which
is usually the vesting period. However, SFAS 123 also allows entities to
continue to measure compensation costs for employee stock compensation plans
using the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25. Because the Company has
elected to continue to follow APB 25, SFAS 123 requires disclosure of pro forma
net income and earnings per share as if the new fair value accounting method was
adopted. The Company has presented the pro forma information required by SFAS
123.
In April 1996, the Board of Directors and shareholders adopted the Rush
Enterprises, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan the Incentive Plan. The Incentive
Plan provides for the grant of stock options which may be nonqualified stock
options or incentive stock options for tax purposes, stock appreciation rights
issued independent of or in tandem with such options SARs, restricted stock
awards and performance awards.                    67

of the date of adoption or on their respective date of election, all of which
are fully vested and are exercisable immediately, and expire ten years from the
date of grant. During the year ended December 31, 1997, 30,000 options were
granted and exercisable at a price equal to the fair values of the Company
common stock at the dates of grant. None of these options have been exercised as
of December 31, 1997. A summary of the Company stock option activity, and related information for
the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997 follows                            1996            1997

forma net income for 1996 and 1997 would be $5,268 million and $5,265 million,
respectively, and pro forma basic and dilutive earnings per share for 1996 and
1997 would be $94 and $79, respectively. The fair value of these options was
estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with a risk-free interest
rate of 55%, a volatility factor of 133, a dividend yield of 0%, and an
expected option life of seven years.
In October 1997, the Company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 171,875
shares of common stock to C. Jim Stewart & Stevenson in connection with the
purchase of the assets of the John Deere construction equipment store. The
warrants are exercisable during the five-year period commencing October 6, 1998,
at an exercise price equal to $1200 per share. None of these warrants have been
exercised as of December 31, 1997. The fair value of these warrants are not
material to the statement of financial position.
15.  EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share for all periods have been restated to reflect the adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share, which
established standards for computing and presenting earnings per share EPS
for entities with publicly held common stock or potential common stock SFAS
128. This statement requires dual presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the
face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures.
Basic EPS were computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS differs from
basic EPS due to the assumed conversions of potentially dilutive options that
were outstanding during the period. The following is a reconciliation of the
numerators and the denominators of the basic and diluted per-share computations
for net income.                                  For the Year Ended December 31, 1997

status of S corporation for federal and state income tax purposes. As an S
corporation, the Company was generally not responsible for income taxes.
Upon the closing of the Offering, the Company S corporation election
terminated and the Company was reorganized as described in Note 3. Accordingly,
the Company became subject to federal and state income taxes from that date
forward.
Upon the Company termination of its S corporation status, the Company provided
deferred income taxes for cumulative temporary differences between the tax basis
and financial reporting basis of its assets and liabilities at the date of
termination.
Provision for Income Taxes
The unaudited pro forma provision for income taxes represents the estimated
income taxes on income from continuing operations that would have been reported
under SFAS 109 had the Company been a taxable entity for both state and federal
income tax purposes as of the beginning of the years ended December 31, 1995 and
1996. The pro forma income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 1995
and 1996, and actual tax provision for the years ended December 31, 1996 and
1997, are summarized as follows in thousands                      Pro Forma      Actual

17. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is contingently liable to finance companies for the notes sold to
such finance companies related to the sale of trucks and construction equipment.
The Company recourse liability related to sold finance contracts is limited to
15 to 25 percent of the outstanding amount of each note sold to the finance
company with the aggregate recourse liability for 1997 being limited to
$600,000. The Company provides an allowance for repossession losses and early
repayment penalties.
Finance contracts sold during the years ended December 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997,
were $53,165,000, $76,390,000 and $91,445,000, respectively.
The Company is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of business. The Company believes it is unlikely that the final
outcome of any of the claims or proceedings to which the Company is a party
would have a material adverse effect on the Company financial position or
results of operations, however, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation,
there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or
proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on the Company results of
operations for the fiscal period in which such resolution occurred.
The Company has consulting agreements with individuals for an aggregate monthly
payment of $25,725. The agreements expire in 1999 through 2001.
18. ACQUISITIONS In February 1994, South Coast acquired substantially all of the operations of an
existing Peterbilt truck dealership in Southern California. South Coast was
initially owned 90 percent by the Company and 10 percent was owned by a minority
interest owner. In August 1995, the Company purchased the minority interest in
South Coast. The Company paid approximately $435,000 for the remaining 10
percent ownership interest.                    71

The following unaudited pro forma summary presents information as if the Kerr
acquisitions see note 1, and minority interest in South Coast acquisition and
the sale of the Rush Pontiac-GMC dealership see Note 4 had occurred at the
beginning of fiscal year 1995. The pro forma information is provided for
information purposes only. It is based on historical information and does not
necessarily reflect the actual results that would have occurred nor is it
necessarily indicative of future results of operations of the Company. In
preparing the pro forma data, adjustments have been made to reflect the impact
of income tax expense for the respective periods and the weighted average common
shares outstanding used in the computation of income from continuing operations
per share has been increased to reflect the number of shares at the Offering
price necessary to fund repayment of the line of credit drawn to pay the $6
million distribution of undistributed S corporation earnings. The following
summary is for the year ended December 31, 1995 unaudited in thousands,

In March 1997, the Company purchased the assets of Denver Peterbilt, Inc.,
which consisted of two full-service Peterbilt dealerships in Denver and Greeley,
Colorado. The purchase price was approximately $79 million, funded by i $65
million of cash and ii $14 million of borrowings under the Company floor
plan financing arrangement with GMAC to purchase new and used truck and parts
inventory. The Company also entered into an agreement whereby the principal of
Denver Peterbilt, Inc. may receive additional amounts based on future sales of
new Peterbilt trucks at the Colorado locations, through March 1999.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 131 Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information SFAS 131. This statement requires that public business
enterprises report certain information about operating segments in complete sets
of financial statements of the enterprise and in condensed financial statements
of interim periods issued to shareholders. It also requires that public business
enterprises report certain information about their products and services, the
geographic areas in which they operate, and their major customers. The effective
date for SFAS No. 131 is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997,
however, the Company has elected to adopt SFAS No. 131 for the year ended
December 31, 1997.
The Company has two reportable segments: the Heavy Duty Truck segment and the
Construction Equipment segment. The Heavy Duty Truck segment operates a regional
network of truck centers that provide an integrated one-stop source for the
trucking needs of its customers, including retail sales of new Peterbilt and
used heavy-duty trucks; after-market parts, service and body shop facilities;
and a wide array of financial services, including the financing of new and used
truck purchases, insurance products and truck leasing and rentals. The
Construction Equipment segment, formed during 1997, operates a full-service John
Deere dealership that serves the Houston, Texas Metropolitan and surrounding
areas. Dealership operations include the retail sale of new and used equipment,
after-market parts and service facilities, equipment rentals, and the financing
of new and used equipment. The Company had only one segment prior to the 1997
John Deere acquisition, and all of the 1995 and 1996 results depict only the
Heavy Duty Truck segment.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates performance
based on income before income taxes not including extraordinary items.                    74
75
The Company accounts for intersegment sales and transfers as if the sales or
transfers were to third parties, that is, at current market prices. There were
no intersegment sales during the year ended December 31, 1997.
The Company reportable segments are strategic business units that offer
different products and services. They are managed separately because each
business requires different technology and marketing strategies. Business units
were maintained through expansion and acquisitions. The following table contains
summarized information about reportable segment profit or loss and segment
assets, for the year ended December 31, 1997: in thousands                    HEAVY-DUTY  CONSTRUCTION

those segments has ever met any of the quantitative thresholds for determining
reportable segments.

Centers of Texas, Inc., to acquire the stock of D Farm and Ranch Supermarket,
Inc. for approximately $105 million, with the purchase price being a
