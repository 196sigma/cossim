We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Accelrys,Inc. at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2011, the nine month period ended December
31, 2010, and for each of the two years in the period ended March31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, Accelrys,Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on the criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 13, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Significant Accounting Policies 
Principles of Consolidation These consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
Fiscal Year On
August3, 2010, our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year end from March31 to December31. The fiscal year end change was effective December31, 2010 and resulted in a nine month reporting period from
April1, 2010 to December31, 2010, which is included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to the twelve-month fiscal year, which prior to April1,
2010, ended on March31, and beginning with January1, 2011, ends on December31, of each year. Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our
estimates, including those related to share-based compensation, income taxes, contingent consideration, and the valuation of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual future results could differ from those estimates. Cash and
Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents. We invest our cash with financial institutions in money market funds and other investment grade securities such as certificates of deposits, commercial paper, corporate and municipal bonds and obligations of U.S. government
sponsored enterprises 
53 Table of Contents
Marketable Securities Our marketable securities consist of debt securities with original maturities of greater than three months and include obligations of U.S. government sponsored enterprises, commercial paper, certificates
of deposits, corporate and municipal debt. We account for our investments in marketable securities in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 320,
InvestmentsDebt and Equity Securities ASC Topic 320. Accordingly, our marketable securities have been classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at their estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses
recorded in stockholders equity and included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale marketable securities are recorded in royalty and other and other income, net. Available-for-sale
marketable securities with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term available-for-sale marketable securities. Available-for-sale marketable securities with remaining
maturities of greater than one year are classified as long-term available-for-sale marketable securities, as we intend to hold these securities until maturity. Unrealized losses which are not considered other than temporary and unrealized gains are
included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Unrealized losses which are determined to be other than temporary are recorded as a charge against income. The cost of marketable securities sold is determined based on
the specific identification method. Marketable securities as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 consisted of the following:

As of December31, 2011 and 2010, we did not have any investments in marketable securities that were
in an unrealized loss position for twelve months or greater. We assess our marketable securities for impairment under the
guidance provided by ASC Topic 320. Accordingly, we review the fair value of our marketable securities at least quarterly to determine if declines in the fair value of individual securities are other-than-temporary in nature. If we believe the
decline in the fair value of an individual security is other-than-temporary, we write-down the carrying value of the security to its estimated fair value, with a corresponding charge against income. To determine if a decline in the fair value of an
investment is other-than-temporary, we consider several factors including, among others, the period of time and extent to which the estimated fair value has been less than cost, overall market conditions, the historical and projected future
financial condition of the issuer of the security and our ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery of the market value. The unrealized losses related to our marketable securities held as of
December31, 2011 were primarily caused by recent fluctuations in market interest rates, and not the credit quality of the issuer, and we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until a recovery of fair value, which may be at
maturity. As a result, we do not believe these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December31, 2011.The contractual maturities of our marketable securities at December31, 2011 are as follows inthousands:
Due within one year 52,976 Due in one to five years 17,224 
70,200 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments on accounts receivable. This estimate is based on a specific
customer analysis and an analysis of our historical write-offs as a percent of outstanding accounts receivable balances. If the financial condition of a customer were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments against
outstanding balances owed to us, an additional allowance may be required. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
We carry our cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted marketable securities and foreign currency forward contracts at market
value. The carrying amount of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued 
55 Table of Contents
liabilities are considered to be representative of their respective fair values due to their short-term nature. Our investments in privately-held companies are carried at cost. Our notes
receivable are carried at net realizable value. It is impracticable for us to estimate the fair value of these instruments on a recurring basis if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect
on their fair value. Property and Equipment Property and equipment consists of the following:  UsefulLifeYrs December31,2011 December31,2010 Inthousands Land 1,959 Buildings 20 2,351 Computers and software 1-3 14,984 12,595 Furniture and fixtures 1-3 1,228 1,124 Leasehold improvements 1-10 5,758 5,746

During the year ended December31, 2011 we committed to a plan to market and sell a property,
encompassing land and an office building, located in Santa Clara, California. Accordingly, the real estate with a total carrying value of $43 million, which was determined to be lower than its estimated fair value, was reclassified as held
for sale and is presented in Property and Equipment, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet for December31, 2011. During the year ended December31, 2011, we wrote off fixed assets which were no longer in use with a total cost of $12 million and associated accumulated depreciation of $11 million, resulting in
a loss of $01 million. During the nine months ended December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, we wrote off the cost and associated accumulated depreciation of approximately $36 million and $01 million unaudited, respectively, of fully
depreciated assets which were no longer in use. During fiscal year 2010 and 2009 we wrote off the cost and associated accumulated depreciation of approximately $12 and $07 million, respectively of fully depreciated assets which were no longer in
use. Depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term. Repair and
maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation expense was $38 million for the year ended December31, 2011. Depreciation expense was $22 million and $12million unaudited for the nine months ended
December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Depreciation expense was $15 million and $19 million for the years ended March31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Software Development Costs We account for costs incurred for
computer software to be sold in accordance with ASC Topic 985, Software. Accordingly, costs incurred internally in the research and development of new software products and significant enhancements to existing software products are expensed
as incurred until the technological feasibility of the product has been established. Technological feasibility occurs shortly before our internally developed software products are available for general release. We have determined that the internal
costs eligible for capitalization are not material. Costs paid to third parties for products in which technological feasibility has been established are capitalized upon purchase of the software. 
At both December31, 2011 and 2010, we had $20 million of capitalized software purchased from third parties. This amount is
included in purchased intangible assets, net, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. These costs are being amortized to cost of revenue on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of five years. Amortization expense was $04
million for the year ended December31, 2011. Amortization 
56 Table of Contents
expense was $03 million for each of the nine months ended December31, 2010 and 2009 unaudited and the year ended March31, 2009, and $04 million for the year ended March31,
2010.

As discussed in Note 3, intangible assets related to the VelQuest and the Contur Acquisitions are
included in our preliminary purchase price allocation and are subject to change during the measurement period. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives either on a straight-line or accelerated basis that reflects the pattern
in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are expected to be realized, which range from two to fifteen years, with no residual value. Intangible asset amortization expense was $210 million for the year ended December31, 2011.
Intangible asset amortization expense was $92 million and $11million unaudited for the nine months ended December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Intangible asset amortization expense was $12 million and $19 million for the years
ended March31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As discussed in detail below under Long Term Investments,
intangible assets with a net book value of $43 million were written off in the quarter ended December31, 2011 as a result of the sale of certain intellectual property to Intermolecular, Inc. IM.

As discussed in Note 3, we made measurement period adjustments related to the Symyx Merger totaling $03 million to accrued liabilities and accrued income tax balances
and measurement period adjustment of $03 million to deferred tax liability balances related to the Contur acquisition. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other ASC Topic 350, we review our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment at least annually in
our fiscal fourth quarter and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of our reporting unit and/or our indefinite-lived intangible asset below their respective carrying
values. Examples of such events or circumstances include: a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, a significant decline in our stock price, a significant decline in our projected revenue or cash flows, an adverse
action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, or the presence of other indicators that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit. 
Our goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been
assigned exceeds managements estimate of its fair value. Based on the guidance provided by ASC Topic 350 and ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, ASC Topic 280 management has determined that our company consists of one
reporting unit given the similarities in economic characteristics between our operations and the common nature of our products, services and customers. Because we have only one reporting unit, and because we are publicly traded, we determine the
fair value of the reporting unit based on our market capitalization as we believe this represents the best evidence of fair value. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for the fiscal year ended
December31, 2011 and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired. Our conclusion that goodwill was not impaired was based on a comparison of our net assets as of December31, 2011 to our market capitalization. 
Our indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the asset exceeds its
estimated fair value. In the quarter ended December31, 2011, we completed our annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test and concluded that our indefinite-lived intangible asset was not impaired. We estimated the fair value of
our indefinite-lived intangible asset utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis which considers the estimated future customer orders for our scientific informatics platform product line and the associated direct and incremental selling, marketing
and development costs. Key assumptions included in the discounted cash flow analysis include projections of future customer order growth for our scientific informatics platform product line and developing an appropriate discount rate. 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets In accordance with ASC Topic 350 and ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, we review long-lived assets to be held and used, including acquired intangible assets subject to amortization and
property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline
in the market price of an asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used, the loss of legal ownership or title to the asset, significant negative industry or economic trends
or the presence of other indicators that would indicate that the carrying 
58 Table of Contents
amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable. An asset is considered to be impaired if managements estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows anticipated to result from the use
of the asset and its eventual disposition are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset. Long Term Investments
Our long term investments consist of equity investments in privately held companies. We determine the accounting
method used to account for investments in equity securities of other business entities in which we do not have a controlling interest primarily based on our ownership of each such business entity and whether we have the ability to exercise
significant influence over the strategic, operating, investing, and financing activities of each such business entity. As we do not have a controlling interest or have the ability to exercise significant influence over the companies, we account for
our investments using the cost method of accounting. We monitor these investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment, market conditions and operational performance and other specific factors relating to the
business underlying the investment. Freeslate We have determined that one of the entities, Freeslate Inc. Freeslate, in which we carry an approximately 195% equity interest, is a variable interest entity in which we are not the primary
beneficiary. The key factors in our assessment were that Freeslates management team and board of directors were solely responsible for all economic aspects of the entity, including key business decisions that impact Freeslates economic
performance and we do not have power, through our variable interest, to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Freeslate. We also do not hold any seats on Freeslates board of directors. Accordingly, we
account for our investment in Freeslate as a cost method investment. The carrying value of our investment in Freeslate was $10 million as of both December31, 2011 and 2010. In addition to our equity interest, we have a warrant allowing us to
retain our 195% interest in the event of dilution through future stock issuances under Freeslates existing stock plans. We have determined that as of December31, 2011, our investment in Freeslate is not impaired. 
We also hold an unsecured promissory note receivable with a face value of $100 million from Freeslate, which bears interest at
8%per annumpayable annually in arrears. The note requires principal payments in the amount of $10 million starting on March1, 2014 and continuing annually until March1, 2019, with the final principal payment of $40 million
due on March1, 2020.As the note receivable was acquired in the Symyx Merger, it was revalued in purchase accounting to its then fair value of $88 million. The note receivable is not measured at fair value on a recurring basis, but is
periodically reviewed for possible impairment. The note receivable had a carrying amount of $87 million and $88 million as of December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our interests in Freeslate is limited to the aggregate of the carrying value of our equity investment and promissory note receivable. There were no future
funding commitments as of December31, 2011 related to Freeslate. Intermolecular 
On July28, 2011, Symyx entered into an agreement the IM Agreement with IM. Symyx was a stockholder of IM, holding
3,968,204 shares of IM common stock on an as-converted to common stock basis, after giving effect to a 1-for-2 reverse stock split on November15, 2011. By virtue of its stock ownership, pursuant to a voting agreement, Symyx was also
entitled to appoint one member of the IM board of directors. Pursuant to the terms of the IM Agreement, subject to the
transactions contemplated thereby, Symyx agreed to: iterminate all royalty obligations of IM accruing after December31, 2011 pursuant to an existing Alliance 
59 Table of Contents
Agreement and an existing Collaborative Development and License Agreement between Symyx and IM; and iitransfer to IM, subject to a license grant back to Symyx, certain patents relating to
Symyxs legacy high-throughput research business. As consideration for the foregoing, IM agreed to: iuse its
commercially reasonable efforts to allow Symyx to be included as a selling stockholder in IMs initial public offering the IPO with respect to not less than all of the IM shares held by Symyx and Symyx is obligated to sell such
shares; iito the extent the gross proceeds from Symyxs sale of all of its IM shares in the IPO are less than $67 million, issue a secured promissory note to Symyx upon the consummation of the IPO in an amount equal to such shortfall;
and iiireimburse Symyx for 50% of the underwriting discounts and commission payable by Symyx with respect to the sale of such shares in the IPO. In addition, pursuant to the IM Agreement, IM agreed to continue to sublicense from Symyx its
rights to certain patents and to assume certain royalty and license fee obligations relating thereto. On November18,
2011, IM filed its final prospectus relating to the IPO and began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. As disclosed in the final prospectus, Symyx participated as a selling stockholder in the IPO by selling 3,968,204 shares of IM common stock
at price per share equal to $1000, resulting in aggregate proceeds of $397 million. In addition, IM reimbursed Symyx for 50% or $14 million, of the underwriting discounts and commissions payable by Symyx in connection with the IPO. 
As a result of the sale of Symyxs equity interest in IM in the IPO and the cash proceeds of $397 million, we recognized a gain on
sale of approximately $190 million, net of transaction costs and commissions of $14 million related to the IPO and consulting costs of $10 million we incurred in connection with the IM Agreement. The gain on sale, offset by the transaction and
consulting costs, is included in net gain on sale of cost method investment in the consolidated statement of operations. 
Pursuant to the terms of the IM Agreement, IM issued to Symyx a secured promissory note receivable in a principal amount equal to $273
million, representing the difference between $67 million and the aggregate gross proceeds from Symyxs sale of its IM common stock in the IPO. The note receivable has a term of 24 months and an interest rate equal to 4% and is payable in
quarterly installments such that an amount equal to the greater of $500,000 per quarter or the amount of accrued interest for such quarter would be payable at the end of each such quarter, with a balloon payment due at maturity. The note is
pre-payable by IM at any time without penalty or premium and is secured by a proportionate amount of IMs tangible fixed assets, excluding intellectual property. The note receivable was discounted to fair value of $260 million, representing the consideration for the patents transferred to IM, for which we carry a purchased technology intangible assets acquired in
the Symyx Merger, and the termination of IMs royalty obligations to Symyx. As such, the sale of the intellectual property resulted in a gain of $217M, after the write-off of intangible assets with a net book value of $43 million. Based on
our assessment of the relevant revenue recognition guidance and other factors, the portion of the net gain equal to the fair value of the note receivable of $260 million was deferred as of December31, 2011, comprising of a short term and a
long term deferred gain of $09 million and $251 million, respectively. We will recognize this gain when principal payments become due on the note receivable. In addition, based on our evaluation of the contractual terms of the promissory note
receivable and its collectability as of December31, 2011, we believe the promissory note receivable meets the definition of a financial asset, therefore we have recorded the note receivable at expected net realizable value on our consolidated
balance sheet with a current and a long term portion of $09 million and $251 million, respectively. The fair value of the note was based on comparable market interest rate of 689% for comparable instruments. In addition, the write-off of the net
book value of the intangible assets related to the intellectual property sold of $43 million is recorded in royalty and other income in our consolidated statement of operations. 
60 Table of Contents
Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from the following primary sources:  software licenses,  post-contract customer support and maintenance services on licensed software collectively referred to as PCS,
content, and  professional services. Customer billings issued in connection with our revenue-generating activities are initially recorded as deferred revenue. We then recognize the revenue from these customer billings as set forth below and
when all of the following criteria are met:  a fully executed written contract or purchase order has been obtained from the customer i.e., persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
the contractual price of the product or services has been defined and agreed to in the contract or purchase order i.e., price is fixed or
determinable,  delivery of the product or service has occurred and no material uncertainties regarding customer acceptance of the delivered product or service exist,
and  collection of the purchase price from the customer is considered probable. 
Software Licenses. We license software on a term and perpetual basis. When sold perpetually, our standard perpetual software
licensing arrangements generally include twelve months of bundled PCS, while our standard term-based software licensing arrangements typically include PCS for the full duration of the term license. Because we do not have vendor-specific objective
evidence VSOE of the fair value of these undelivered elements, we recognize as revenue the entire fee for such perpetual and term-based licenses ratably over the term of the bundled PCS. 
Renewal of PCS Under Perpetual Software Licenses. Our PCS includes the right to receive unspecified upgrades or enhancements and
technical support. Fees from customer renewals of PCS related to previously purchased perpetual licenses are recognized ratably over the term of the PCS. Content. Content is licensed on a term basis and provides customers with access to the licensed content over the term of the agreement. Revenue from these licensing arrangements is recognized
ratably over the term of the agreement, which is typically twelve months. Professional Services. We provide certain
services to our customers, including non-complex product training, installation, implementation and other professional services which are non-essential to the operation of the software. We also perform professional services for our customers
designed to enhance the value of our software products by creating extensions to functionality to address a clients specific business needs. When sold separately, revenue from these services is generally recognized as the services are
delivered under the proportional performance when we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best-efforts basis. For service
arrangements that include provisions that create significant uncertainties e.g. customer acceptance or service deliverables wherein the level of effort to complete the services cannot be reasonably estimated, the associated revenue is recognized
using the completed performance method. Multi-Element Arrangements. For multi-element arrangements which include
software licenses, PCS and non-complex training, installation and implementation services which are non-essential to the operation of the software, the entire fee for such arrangements is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the PCS or
61 Table of Contents
delivery of the services, whichever is longer. For multi-element arrangements which also include services that are essential to the operation of the software, the fee for such arrangements is
generally deferred until the services essential to the operation of the software have been performed, at which point the entire fee for such arrangements is recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining term of the PCS or the delivery of the
non-essential services, whichever is longer. Sales Taxes Collected 
Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to various governmental agencies are excluded from revenues in our consolidated
statements of operations. Shipping Costs The costs of shipping products to our customers are expensed as incurred and are included in cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. We incurred shipping costs of $04 million during
the year ended December31, 2011. We incurred shipping costs of $06 million, $03 million unaudited, $03 million and $04 million during the nine months ended December31, 2010 and 2009, and the years ended March31, 2010 and
2009, respectively. Advertising Costs The costs of advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. We incurred advertising costs of $02 million during the
year ended December31, 2011. We incurred advertising costs of $01 million during each of the nine months ended December31, 2010 and 2009 unaudited, and the year ended March31, 2009. We incurred advertising costs of $03 million
during the year ended March31, 2010. Foreign Currency Translation 
In accordance with ASC Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters, we translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into
U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation are excluded from results of
operations and recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Gains and losses resulting
from the cash settlement of certain intercompany transactions as well as transactions with customers and vendors that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each entity give rise to foreign exchange gains or losses. We
realized foreign exchange gains of $05 million during the year ended December31, 2011. We realized foreign exchange gains of $02 million and $01 million unaudited during the nine months ended December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively,
and $04 million and $03 million during the years ended March31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These amounts are included in royalty and other income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. 
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges We transact business in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar and have significant international sales, expenses and intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar,
subjecting us to currency exchange rate risks. To mitigate our risk from foreign currency fluctuations, we launched a foreign currency hedging program in November 2011, whereby we will periodically enter into currency derivative contracts,
principally forward contracts with-short term maturities. Our intent is to offset gains and losses that 
62 Table of Contents
occur from the underlying exposure with gains and losses on the derivative contracts used to offset them. We do not hold or purchase any foreign currency contracts for trading or speculative
purposes and we do not designate these forward contracts or swaps as hedging instruments. Accordingly, we report the fair value of these contracts in the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded in royalty and other income, net
in the consolidated statement of operations. The fair value of foreign currency contracts is estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period. 
Royalty Income 
We recognize royalty income based on reported sales by third party licensees of products containing the applicable licensed materials and
intellectual property. Royalty revenue is recognized as these payments become due. Non-refundable royalties, for which there are no further performance obligations, are recognized when due under the terms of the applicable agreements. 
Deferred Costs 
Occasionally, we enter into professional service arrangements under which resulting revenue is deferred until certain elements of the
arrangements are delivered. As a result, if deemed material, we defer the direct variable expense, not exceeding the revenue deferred, in other current assets on the balance sheet until the period when revenue is recognized. Direct and incremental
variable expenses include direct labor costs and direct services contracts with third parties working on the software service arrangements. As of December31, 2011 and 2010, we deferred approximately $09 million and $05 million, respectively,
of direct and incremental variable costs related to software service arrangements where the revenue is deferred until future periods. 
Concentrations of Risk We maintain deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. We do not believe we are exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the
depository institutions in which those deposits are held. Additionally, we have established guidelines regarding diversification of our investment portfolio, credit quality of issuers and maturities of investments, which are designed to maintain the
safety and liquidity of our deposits and investments. In addition to our U.S. operations, we conduct business in Europe and
in the Asia/Pacific region, primarily in Japan. Any significant decline in the economies or the value of the currencies in these regions could have a material adverse impact on us. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC
Topic 740, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities by applying enacted
statutory tax rates applicable to future years. The provision for income taxes is based on our estimates for taxable income of the various legal entities and jurisdictions in which we operate. As such, income tax expense may vary from the customary
relationship between income tax expense and pre-tax income. We establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets to reduce them to the amount expected to be realized. 
We assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis. In making this assessment we are required to consider all
available positive and negative evidence to determine whether, based on such evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our net deferred assets will be realized in future periods. This assessment requires significant judgment.
We do not recognize current and future tax benefits until it is more likely than not that our tax positions will be sustained. In general, any realization of our net deferred tax assets will reduce our effective rate in future periods. However, the
realization of deferred tax assets that are related to net operating losses NOLs that were generated by tax deductions resulting from the exercise of non-qualified stock options will be a direct increase to stockholders equity.
63 Table of Contents
We determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be
sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. We recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position taken on our income tax return at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the
relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Interest and penalties related to income tax matters are recognized in income tax expense. During the year ended December31, 2011, and the nine months ended December31, 2010 we incurred
approximately $01 million and $05 million, respectively, in interest and penalties which remained accrued as of December31, 2011. During the nine months ended December31, 2009 unaudited and the years ended March31, 2010 and
2009, we did not incur any expense related to interest or penalties for income tax matters. Net Income Loss Per Share
We compute net income loss per share pursuant to ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. Accordingly, basic net income
loss per share and diluted net loss per share are computed by dividing the net income loss for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted
net income per share is computed by dividing the net income for the period by the weighted average number of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common stock equivalents consist of common
stock options and unvested restricted stock units RSUs.

Approximately 38 million shares potentially dilutive securities were not included in the computation of
diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2011, because these were anti-dilutive. As we reported a net loss for the nine months ended December31, 2010, basic and diluted net loss per share were the same. Potentially dilutive securities
outstanding totaling 69million shares were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share for the nine months ended December31, 2010 because to do so would have been anti-dilutive. Potentially dilutive common stock
equivalents that were excluded from the diluted net income per share calculations since their effect would be anti-dilutive totaled approximately 31million shares for the nine months ended December31, 2009 and for each of the years
ended March31, 2010 and 2009. Share Based Compensation 
We account for our share-based awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718, CompensationStock Compensation ASC Topic
718. We estimate the fair value of our share-based stock awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of certain input variables, which are further discussed
in Note 4.

Comprehensive Income Loss In accordance with ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income, we report the components of comprehensive income, including net income, in the financial statements in the period in which they are
recognized. Comprehensive income is defined as all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources, including foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities. We present comprehensive income
in our consolidated statements of stockholders equity. Accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity consists of the following:  December31,2011 December31,2010 March31,2010 Inthousands Foreign currency translation adjustment 291 1,435 1,463 Unrealized gain loss on marketable securities 89 29

Guarantees We account for guarantees in accordance with ASC Topic 460, Guarantees ASC Topic 460. ASC Topic 460 requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability
for the fair value of certain guarantees and requires certain disclosures to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued.

Effect of New Accounting Standards 
In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No2011-12, Comprehensive Income Topic 220:
Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No2011-05ASU 2011-12. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU
No2011-05, Comprehensive Income Topic 220: Presentation of Comprehensive Income ASU 2011-05. ASU 2011-05 requires retrospective application, and both ASUs are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December15, 2011 and the interim reporting periods within those years. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. Instead, ASU
2011-05 requires entities to report all non-owner changes in stockholders equity in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. In addition, items of other comprehensive income
that are reclassified to profit or loss are required to be presented separately on the face of the financial statements. ASU 2011-05 does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income, or when an item must be reclassified
to net income. ASU 2011-12 defers the changes in ASU 2011-05 that pertain to how, when and where reclassification adjustments are presented. We do not expect the adoption of these standards to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment ASU
2011-08, which gives an entity the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform step 1 of the annual goodwill impairment test. An entity is required to perform step 1 only if it concludes that
it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount. An entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of its reporting units or an entity may bypass the qualitative
assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step 1 of the impairment test. This new guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2011.
Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this accounting pronouncement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December of 2010, the FASB issued ASU No2010-28, When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts ASU
2010-28., which amends ASC Topic 350 and clarifies the requirement to test for impairment of goodwill. ASC Topic 350 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Under ASU
2010-28, when the carrying amount of a reporting unit is zero or negative an entity must assume that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, perform an additional test to determine whether goodwill has been impaired and
calculate the amount of that impairment. The modifications to ASC Topic 350 resulting from the issuance of ASU 2010-28 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2010 and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is
not permitted. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  3.
Business Combinations 
Symyx Merger On July1, 2010, we completed the Symyx Merger, whereby Symyx became our wholly owned subsidiary. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated April5,
2010, by and among Accelrys, Merger Sub and Symyx the Merger Agreement, Symyx stockholders received 07802 shares of our common stock the Exchange Ratio for each share of Symyx common stock held on July1, 2010. As a
result, we issued an aggregate of approximately 275million shares of our common stock to Symyx stockholders on July1, 2010. In addition, outstanding options to purchase Symyx common stock were assumed by us and converted into options to
purchase 2,441,274 shares of our common stock based on the Exchange Ratio. Based on criteria under business combination accounting guidance, Accelrys was deemed to be the accounting acquirer.

During the six months ended June30, 2011, we made measurement period adjustments totaling $04
million to accrued liabilities and accrued income tax balances. We did not recast the December31, 2010 balance sheet as a result of these measurement period adjustments as we did not consider them to be material. 
Actual and Pro Forma Impact of the Symyx Merger The following unaudited pro forma information presents the consolidated results of Accelrys and Symyx for the nine months ended December31, 2010 and 2009 and the year ended March31, 2010, with
adjustments to give effect to pro forma events that are directly attributable to the Symyx Merger and have a continuing impact, but exclude the impact of pro forma events that are directly attributable to the Symyx Merger and are one-time
occurrences. The unaudited pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations of future periods, the results of operations that actually would have been realized had the
entities been a single company during the periods presented or the results of operations that the combined company will experience after the Symyx Merger. The unaudited pro forma information does not give effect to the potential impact of current
financial conditions, regulatory matters or any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may be associated with the Symyx Merger. The unaudited pro forma information also does not include any integration costs,

Contur Acquisition 
On May19, 2011, by and through our subsidiary, Accelrys Software Inc., we entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement the
Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we acquired all outstanding equity interests in Contur. We acquired Contur as part of our strategy to expand our product portfolio to complement our current software offerings. Based in Stockholm,
Sweden, Contur licenses electronic laboratory notebook software solutions which enable scientific organizations to document their research and development processes and to capture their intellectual property. Contur is a provider of electronic lab
notebook capabilities via a software-as-a-service model. The total consideration for the net assets acquired is up to $111
million, consisting of an initial cash payment of $106 million, which was paid in connection with the signing and simultaneous closing of the acquisition, and additional consideration of up to $05 million upon the achievement of certain
agreed-upon performance milestones, payable in equal increments upon each of the first and second anniversaries of the date of the acquisition. In accordance with the term of the Purchase Agreement, we deposited $05 million in an escrow account in
our name on the acquisition date for the potential payments for the contingent consideration obligation. These funds are included in the restricted cash line item in the consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2011. 
We funded the purchase price with cash on hand. All acquisition costs related to the transaction were expensed as incurred. The total
acquisition date fair value of the consideration was estimated at approximately $110 million as follows in thousands:  Initial cash payment to Contur 10,624 Estimated fair value of contingent milestone consideration 335 
Total consideration 10,959 
As of the acquisition date, a liability of $03 million was recognized for the estimated fair value of
the contingent milestone consideration. Any change in the fair value of the liability subsequent to the acquisition date will be recognized in earnings. We have determined the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation based on a
discounted probability-weighted income approach derived from revenue estimates and a probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving the milestone criteria. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is as follows:  inthousands Fair Value of Consideration Transferred 10,959 Less: Recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed Cash and cash equivalents 761 Accounts receivable 641 Other current assets 240 Property, plant and equipment 51 Intangible assets 4,410 Other current liabilities 727 Deferred tax liabilities 1,582 Deferred revenue 353 
Goodwill 7,518 
We may adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation after obtaining more information regarding
preliminary estimates of net deferred tax assets and potential limitations on their use. During the year ended December31, 2011, we made measurement period adjustments totaling $03 million to accrued deferred income tax balances. 
69 Table of Contents
In addition to the initial purchase price, we have deposited $20 million in an escrow
account in the name of the six former equity holders of Contur. The escrowed funds will be released upon satisfaction of certain representations and warranties for a period of two years following the acquisition date, in $10 million increments upon
each of the first and second anniversaries of the date of the acquisition if, and to the extent that, no breaches of the representations and warranties have occurred. The $20 million is also subject to forfeiture in equal amounts by each of the
former equity holders if employment is terminated prior to a two-year retention period. Accordingly, the payment was determined to be compensation for post-acquisition service, the cost of which will be recognized as compensation expense over the
two-year retention period. We have determined that the acquisition of Contur was a non-material business combination. As
such, pro forma disclosures are not required and are not presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of Contur from the date of acquisition. 
VelQuest Acquisition On December30, 2011, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger pursuant to which VelQuest became our wholly owned subsidiary. We acquired VelQuest as part of our strategy to expand our product
portfolio to complement our current software offerings. Based in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, VelQuest extends our software portfolio into pharmaceutical development quality assurance and quality control, offering significant productivity improvements,
faster cycle times, lower operational costs and reduced compliance risks for regulated life sciences organizations. The total
consideration for the net assets acquired was $350 million, consisting of an initial cash payment of $2975 million, which was paid in connection with the signing and simultaneous closing of the acquisition, and additional consideration of $525
million which was deposited into an escrow account in the name of the selling shareholders on the acquisition date. The escrowed funds will be released upon satisfaction of certain representations and warranties for a period of 15 months following
the acquisition date, if, and to the extent that, no breaches of the representations and warranties have occurred. We funded
the purchase price with cash on hand. All acquisition costs related to the transaction were expensed as incurred. The total acquisition date fair value of the consideration was $350 million. 
The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is as follows: inthousands Fair Value of Consideration Transferred 35,000 Less: Recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed Cash and cash equivalents 299 Accounts receivable 4,336 Other assets 23 Property, plant and equipment 14 Intangible assets 10,880 Other current liabilities 955 Deferred revenue 3,430 
Goodwill 23,833 
Given the proximity of the acquisition to the year ended December 31, 2011, the above purchase price
allocation is considered preliminary and is subject to revision during the measurement period. Management is awaiting the third party analysis of the valuation of acquired intangible assets and deferred revenue. Additionally, we are in the process
of obtaining support for the net present value of accounts receivable and other assets, and obligations related to income tax and other liabilities. We have determined that the acquisition of VelQuest was a non-material business combination. As such, pro forma disclosures are not required and are not presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The
consolidated financial statements include the operating results of VelQuest from the date of acquisition.

Share-Based Payments 
2011 Stock Incentive Plan On August3, 2011, our stockholders approved the adoption of our 2011 Stock Incentive Plan the 2011 Plan. The total number of shares of our common stock that are reserved for issuance
under the 2011 Plan is 1775million shares of our common stock iless xthat number of shares of our common stock subject to a stock option or stock appreciation right SAR granted after May31, 2011 under the
Companys 2004 Stock Plan or 2007 Stock Plan together, the Prior Plans and y222 shares of our common stock for every one share of our common stock that was subject to an award other than a stock option or SAR granted
after May31, 2011 under the Prior Plans, and iiplus xthat number of shares of our common stock subject to a stock option or SAR, that in each case would, at any time after May31, 2011, otherwise return to the available
pool of unissued shares reserved for awards under any Prior Plan ignoring the termination or expiration of such plans for the purpose of determining the number of shares available under the plan and y222 shares of our common stock for
every one share of our common stock that was subject to an award other than a stock option or SAR, that in each case would, at any time after May31, 2011, otherwise return to the available pool of unissued shares reserved for awards under any
Prior Plan ignoring the termination or expiration of such plans for the purpose of determining the number of shares available under the plan. The 2011 Plan also provides that the following shares of our common stock will not be returned to the
2011 Plan or otherwise become available for issuance under the 2011 Plan: ishares of common stock tendered by participants as full or partial payment to the Company upon exercise of options granted under the 2011 Plan; iishares of
common stock withheld by, or otherwise remitted to, the Company to satisfy a participants tax withholding obligations; and iiishares of common stock covered by the portion of any stock appreciation right SAR that is
exercised whether or not such shares of common stock are actually issued to a participant upon exercise of the SAR. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any shares of common stock issued in connection with awards other than stock options and SARs will be
counted against the total share limit reserved under the 2011 Plan by applying the Multiplier as defined below to the shares of common stock covered by each such award; conversely, shares of common stock returned to or deemed not to have been
issued from the 2011 Plan under awards other than stock options and SARs will return to the share reserve at a rate determined by multiplying such number of shares by the Multiplier. The Multiplier for awards other than stock options and
SARs will be 222 shares of common stock for every 10 share of common stock issued in connection with such award. For example, a grant of a restricted stock award for 1,000 shares would count as 2,220 shares against the reserve, and if returned to
the 2011 Plan, would count as 2,220 shares returned to the 2011 Plan. As of December31, 2011, there are approximately 15,047,000 shares of our common stock available for issuance under the 2011 Plan. 
Share-Based Award Activity Our stock options generally vest over four years and have a contractual term of seven to ten years. A summary of stock option activity under our share-based compensation plans is as follows: NumberofShares WeightedAverageExercisePrice AggregateIntrinsicValue   Outstanding at December31, 2010 5,858 942 Granted 1,557 696 Exercised 329 514 Expired/Forfeited 1,065 1714

Exercisable at December31, 2011 3,368 845 2,138 409 
71 Table of Contents
The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding and exercisable at
December31, 2011 was based on the closing price of our common stock on December31, 2011 of $672 per share. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $10 million during each of the year ended December31, 2011 and
the nine months ended December31, 2010. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the nine months ended December31, 2009 was $26,000 and was $01 million for each of the years ended March31, 2010 and 2009.
RSUs granted under our Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan , as amended the 2004 Plan, the 2007 Plan
and the 2011 Plan generally vest annually over three years and, once vested, do not expire. Upon vesting of an RSU, employees are generally issued an equivalent number of shares of our common stock. A summary of RSU activity under our share-based
compensation plans is as follows:  NumberofShares  Inthousands,except

Unvested at December 31, 2011 1,432 682 
Included in the vested shares for the period are approximately 01million shares tendered to us by
employees for payment of minimum income tax obligations upon vesting of RSUs. Valuation Assumptions of Share-Based Awards
We estimate the fair value of our share-based awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of certain input variables, as follows: Expected
Volatility. Volatility is a measure of the amount the stock price will fluctuate during the expected life of an award. We determine volatility based on our historical stock price volatility over the most recent period equivalent to the expected
life of the award, giving consideration to company-specific events impacting historical volatility that are unlikely to occur in the future, as well as anticipated future events that may impact volatility. We also consider the historical stock price
volatilities of comparable publicly traded companies. Risk-Free Interest Rate. Our assumption of the risk-free
interest rate is based on the interest rates on U.S. constant rate treasury securities with contractual terms approximately equal to the expected life of the award. Expected Dividend Yield. Because we have not paid any cash dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future, we assume a dividend yield of zero.
Expected Award Life. We determine the expected life of an award by considering various relevant factors, including the
vesting period and contractual term of the award, our employees historical exercise patterns and length of service and employee characteristics. We also consider the expected terms of comparable publicly traded companies. For Employee Stock
Purchase Plan ESPP purchase rights, the expected life is equal to the current offering period under the ESPP. 
Under ASC Topic 718, we are also required to estimate at grant the likelihood that the award will ultimately vest the pre-vesting
forfeiture rate and revise the estimate, if necessary, in future periods if the actual forfeiture rate differs. We determine the pre-vesting forfeiture rate of an award based on our historical pre-vesting award forfeiture experience, giving
consideration to company-specific events impacting our historical 
72 Table of Contents
pre-vesting award forfeiture experience that are unlikely to occur in the future as well as anticipated future events that may impact forfeiture rates. 
Our determination of the input variables used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model as well as the pre-vesting forfeiture rate is
based on various underlying estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective and are affected by our stock price, among other factors. Changes in these underlying estimates and assumptions could materially affect the fair value of our
share-based awards and, therefore, the amount of share-based compensation expense to be recognized in our results of operations. The fair value of stock options and ESPP purchase rights granted during the year ended December31, 2011, the nine months ended December31, 2010 and 2009, and the years ended March31,
2010 and 2009 was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:  Year Ended Nine Months Ended Years Ended December31,2011 December31,2010 December31,2009 March31,2010 March31,2009 unaudited StockOptions ESPPPurchaseRights StockOptions ESPPPurchaseRights StockOptions ESPPPurchaseRights StockOptions ESPPPurchaseRights StockOptions ESPPPurchaseRights Expected volatility 50 35 51 28 58 64 58 64 54 68 Risk-free interest rate 08 01 15 02 25 03 25 03 29 11 Expected option life in years 5 05 5 05 5 05 5 05 5 05 Expected dividend yield 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Weighted average per share grant date fair value 304 172 306 164 292 122 291 122 272 146
The fair value of RSUs granted during the year ended December31, 2011, the nine months ended
December31, 2010 and 2009, and the years ended March31, 2010 and 2009 was based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. Share-Based Compensation Expense The estimated fair value of our
share-based awards is recognized as a charge against income on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period of the award. Total share-based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated
statements of operations for the year ended December31, 2011, the nine months ended December31, 2010 and 2009 and the years ended March31, 2010 and 2009 was as follows: Year EndedDecember31 NineMonthsEndedDecember31 Years EndedMarch31 2011 2010 2009 2010 2009 unaudited In thousands Cost of revenue 333 179 198 276 264 Product development 1,136 794 704 930 859 Sales and marketing 1,672 940 763 1,052 952 General and administrative 2,428 1,506 1,251 1,674 1,385 Business consolidation, transaction and restructuring costs 3 879

73 Table of Contents
No share-based compensation expense was capitalized in the periods presented. At
December31, 2011, the gross amount of unrecognized share-based compensation expense relating to unvested share-based awards was approximately $113 million, which we anticipate recognizing as a charge against income over a weighted average
period of 25 years. The total fair value of RSUs vested was $30 million for the year ended December31, 2011. The total fair value of RSUs vested was $23 million, $18million, $19million and $15million for the nine months
ended December31, 2010 and 2009, and for the years ended March31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Stock Repurchases
On November10, 2010, we entered into a stock repurchase plan with a broker the Repurchase Plan, in
accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act. Pursuant to the Repurchase Plan, and subject to the conditions set forth therein and the provisions of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, we
instructed the broker to purchase for our account up to $60 million worth of our common stock by March31, 2011. As of December31, 2010, we had repurchased 353,955 shares of our common stock for approximately $30 million at an average
cost of $840 per share. We completed the repurchase of the remaining $30 million of our common stock by purchasing 350,553 shares at an average cost of $850 per share, during the quarter ended March31, 2011. 
On March11, 2011, we entered into a second stock repurchase plan the Second Repurchase Plan and, together with the
Repurchase Plan, the Repurchase Plans in accordance with Rule10b5-1 of Exchange Act. Pursuant to the Second Repurchase Plan, and subject to the conditions set forth therein and the provisions of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, we
instructed the broker to purchase for our account up to an additional $40 million worth of our common stock by September30, 2011. We repurchased 253,624 shares of our common stock for $20 million during the quarter ended June30, 2011,
and we completed the repurchase of the remaining $20 million of our common stock by purchasing 273,141 shares at an average cost of $729 per share during the quarter ended September30, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, we have repurchased a
total of 1,231,273 shares for $100 million under the Repurchase Plans. All of the shares repurchased under the Repurchase Plans have been recorded as treasury stock. On August3, 2011, our board of directors authorized the Company to commit up to $80million for the repurchase of the Companys common stock pursuant to a program to be executed in
accordance with a Rule10b5-1 trading plan.On February29, 2012, our board of directors authorized the Company to commit up to an additional $20 million for a total repurchase of up to $100 million of the Companys common
stock during fiscal 2012 pursuant to a program to be executed in accordance with a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. We have not made any purchases under these authorizations.

At December31, 2011 and December31, 2010, we had $34 million and $29 million, respectively,
of net deferred tax liabilities in the U.S. related to indefinite-lived goodwill and intangible assets that are amortized for income tax purposes. For book purposes, the indefinite-lived goodwill and intangible assets will be charged to results of
operations when they are determined to be impaired in accordance with ASC Topic 350. Because we cannot predict when these assets will be impaired and when the associated deferred tax liabilities will reverse, the deferred tax liabilities related to
these assets are not considered a source of income to support the realization of our deferred tax assets. Additionally, we have deferred tax liabilities of $07 million related to the acquisition of Symyx for purchase price adjustments associated
with land and other investments. Upon disposition, we will have a lower tax basis in these assets. As we cannot predict when these assets will be disposed of, the deferred tax liabilities associated with these assets are also not considered a source
of income to support the realization of our deferred tax assets. We have provided a full valuation allowance for our remaining net U.S. deferred tax assets as we do not believe that the ultimate realization of such deferred tax assets is
more-likely-than-not. At December31, 2011 and December31, 2010, we also had $13 million and $10 million,
respectively, of net deferred tax assets related to Accelrys, K.K. As of December31, 2011, we also have $02 million and $05 million of deferred tax assets for Symyx KK and Symyx Switzerland, respectively. As of December31, 2011, we
have a $11 million deferred tax asset for Accelrys UK related to net operating loss carryforwards. We believe that the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is more-likely-than-not since our intercompany transfer pricing arrangements
provide for Accelrys, K.K., Symyx KK , Symyx Switzerland and Accelrys UK to achieve an annual operating profit margin. Due to
uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income, a valuation allowance has been established against our domestic deferred tax assets. As of December31, 2011 the valuation allowance was $483 million. For the year ended
December31, 2011, the valuation allowance decreased by $30 million primarily as a result of the recognition of a deferred tax asset for net operating losses in the UK and the netting of deferred tax liabilities for land and other investments.
For the nine months ended December31, 2010, the valuation allowance decreased by $149 million as a result of net deferred tax liabilities recorded for the Symyx 
76 Table of Contents
acquisition, which were considered a source of income to reduce the valuation allowance on our existing deferred tax assets. In addition, during the nine months ended December31, 2010, the
valuation allowance increased by $142 million as a result of operating losses for which no tax benefit was recorded and decreased by $94 million related to NOLs and tax credits which either expired or were limited under Internal Revenue Code
section 382. For the year ended March31, 2010, the valuation allowance decreased by $55 million principally as a result of the utilization of domestic NOL carryovers, the expiration of domestic NOL carryovers and a reduction in the state tax
rate applied to deferred tax assets. As of December31, 2011, we had U.S. federal NOLs of approximately
$823million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $27 million. We also had California NOLs of approximately $675 million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $108 million. We also had approximately $66 million of UK NOLs.
Approximately $467 million of the federal NOLs relate to stock option deductions which, upon realization, will result in an increase to paid-in capital and a decrease in income taxes payable. Approximately $8 million U.S. federal NOLs expired as of
December31, 2010. If not fully utilized, portions of our U.S. federal NOLs and tax credit carryforwards will expire in varying amounts from 2011 through 2029, and portions of our California NOLs will expire in varying amounts from 2011 through
2019. The California tax credit carryforwards do not expire. Realization of our NOLs and credits is dependent upon our generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of those attributes. 
In addition to the NOLs reflected above, as of December31, 2011, we had pre-acquisition NOLs of $397 million from acquisitions
outside the U.S. which have been reserved as unrecognized tax benefits. The pre- acquisition NOLs, if ultimately realized, will result in an increase to income tax benefit. No pre-acquisition NOLs were utilized during the year ended
December31, 2011 , the nine months ended December31, 2010 or the year ended March31, 2010. We recognize
windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized. Accordingly, deferred tax assets are not recognized for NOLs resulting from windfall tax benefits. At December31,
2011, deferred tax assets do not include $02 million of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. The future
utilization of our NOLs to offset future taxable income may be subject to a substantial annual limitation as a result of changes in ownership by our stockholders that hold 5% or more of our common stock. An assessment of such ownership changes under
Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code was completed through December31, 2010. As a result of this assessment, we determined that we experienced an ownership change during 2010 related to the acquisition of Symyx which will limit
the future utilization of our NOLs and credit carryforwards. U.S. federal NOLs of approximately $171 million will expire due to limitations under Sections 382 and U.S. federal RD credits of approximately $22 million will expire due to
limitations under Section383. Future ownership changes may further impact the utilization of existing NOLs and tax credit carryforwards. Upon the adoption of new accounting principles relating to uncertain tax positions as of April1, 2007, Accelrys did not record any reserves for uncertain tax positions. In the third quarter for the
year ended March31, 2010 Accelrys identified an uncertain tax position of $108 million relating to the NOL carryovers obtained in connection with the acquisition of one of our foreign subsidiaries. Additionally, during the nine months ended
December31, 2010 we identified an additional $73 million in uncertain tax positions.

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of December31, 2011, are $127 million of
tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Also included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2011, are $29 million of tax benefits that, if recognized, would result in adjustments to other
tax accounts, primarily deferred taxes. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in
the provision for income taxes. The Company has approximately $06 million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes at December31, 2011. 
We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Our tax years from 1996 forward are subject to
examination by the U.S. and various other state jurisdictions due to the carryforward of unutilized NOLs and research and development credits. With respect to significant foreign jurisdictions, tax years from 2005 and forward are subject to
examinations by various foreign tax authorities in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Switzerland, and Japan and tax years from 2006 and forward are subject to examination by foreign tax authorities in Germany and France. 
6.Retirement Savings Plans 
U.S. Based Employees We have an employee savings and retirement plan the 401KPlan. The 401KPlan is intended to be a tax-qualified plan covering substantially all U.S.-based employees. Under the
terms of the 401KPlan, employees may elect to contribute up to 20% of their compensation, or the statutory prescribed limit, if less. We may, at our discretion, match employee contributions up to a maximum of 4% of the employees
compensation. Employer matching contributions totaled $13 million, $08million and $05million for the year ended December31, 2011 and the nine months ended December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $06 million and $07
million for the years ended March31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
78 Table of Contents
Non-U.S. Based Employees 
We provide retirement benefits for employees located outside the U.S. commensurate with other similar companies in those respective
locations. Employer contributions, in the form of cash, totaled $11 million, $06million for the year ended December31, 2011, $06 million for the nine months ended December31, 2010 and the year ended March31, 2010, and
$05million and $07 million for the nine months ended December31, 2009 and the year ended March31, 2009, respectively. 
7.Fair Value 
Financial Assets and Liabilities We carry our cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted marketable securities and foreign currency forward contracts at market value. Cash equivalents are comprised of short-term, highly liquid
investments including money market funds and other investment grade securities such as certificates of deposits, commercial paper, corporate and municipal bonds and obligations of U.S. government sponsored enterprises. Our marketable securities
consist of debt securities with original maturities of greater than three months and include obligations of U.S. government sponsored enterprises, commercial paper, certificates of deposits and corporate and municipal debt. 
Fair value accounting provides a definition of fair value, establishes acceptable methods of measuring fair value and expands disclosures
for fair value measurements. The principles apply under accounting pronouncements which require measurement of fair value and do not require any new fair value measurements in accounting pronouncements where fair value is the relevant measurement
attribute. Fair value accounting also specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques. Observable inputs highest level reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable
inputs lowest level reflect internally developed market assumptions. In accordance with fair value accounting, fair value
measurements are classified under the following hierarchy: Level 1Quoted prices for identical instruments in active
markets. Level 2Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly. These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that
are observable for the asset or liability such as interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc. or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market data by correlation or other means. 
Level 3Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are unobservable. 
Fair value measurements are classified according to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation. A
measurement may therefore be classified within Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily observable. 
Where applicable, the determination of fair values is based on unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for the
identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. This pricing methodology applies to our Level1 investments. To the extent quoted prices in active markets are not available at the measurement date, fair values can be based on usage of
observable market prices in less active markets, use of broker/dealer quotes and alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis or have market prices from
multiple sources, the pricing applications may apply available information as applicable to determine the fair value as of the measurement date. This methodology applies to our Level2 investments. Currently we do not hold any Level 3
investments. 
79 Table of Contents
We recorded an acquisition-related liability for contingent consideration representing the
amounts payable to former Contur equity holders, as outlined under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon performance milestones. The fair value of this Level 3 liability is estimated based on a discounted
probability-weighted income approach derived from revenue estimates and a probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving the milestone criteria. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability will
be recorded in the statement of operations. As discussed in Note 2, the valuation of this contingent liability is included in our preliminary purchase price allocation and is subject to change during the measurement period. We have recognized a
$78,000 increase to the acquisition date liability for contingent consideration as of December31, 2011. The following
table summarizes our assets and liabilities that require fair value measurements on a recurring basis and their respective input levels based on the fair value hierarchy: CarryingValue atDecember31,2011  1  2  3 Inthousands December31, 2011 Cash equivalents1 30,541 27,440 3,101 Short-Term Marketable Securities U.S. Treasury securities 2,513 2,513 U.S. government and agency securities 9,526 9,526 Commercial paper and certificates of deposit 3,449 3,449 Corporate debt securities 33,793 33,793 Municipal debt securities 3,695 3,695 Long-Term Marketable Securities U.S. Treasury securities 3,356 3,356 U.S. government and agency securities 1,784 1,784 Corporate debt securities 12,084 12,084

The carrying amount of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are considered to be
representative of their respective fair values due to their short-term nature. Our investments in privately-held companies are carried at cost. Our notes receivable are carried at the expected net realizable value. It is impracticable for us to
estimate the fair value of these instruments on a recurring basis if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on their fair value. Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis The non-financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value subsequent to initial recognition when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. There were no non-financial assets and
liabilities deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired and measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis for the periods presented. 
8.Commitments and Contingencies 
Operating Leases We lease office space in several facilities under operating leases that expire through 2022. Certain of our lease agreements contain renewal options, rent holidays or rent escalation clauses. In
accordance with ASC Topic 840, Leases , we recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the related operating leases, accounting for scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments
commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy and including any cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in economic penalty. Rent expense recognized in excess of rent paid is reflected as a
deferred rent liability, which is included in lease-related liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Rent expense under our operating leases was $62 million, $39 million and $25 million for the year ended December31,
2011, and,-the nine months ended December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $33 million for each of the years ended March31, 2010 and 2009. 
81 Table of Contents
Additionally, under the terms of the lease for our San Diego, California corporate office,
we were required to obtain an irrevocable letter of credit for $66 million to ensure our performance under the lease agreement. The letter of credit requirement decreased to $35 million on September1, 2011 and will expire upon termination of
the lease on September1, 2013. The letter of credit is fully secured by cash and cash equivalents, which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
We sublease certain facilities abandoned in connection with previous restructuring activities, and sublease income is recorded as a reduction of the
restructuring liability and related restructuring expense upon abandonment of the facility. Future minimum lease commitments
and future committed sublease income as of December31, 2011 are as follows:  OperatingLeaseCommitments SubleaseIncome Net Inthousands Fiscal year 2012 7,885 1,445 6,440 Fiscal year 2013 5,985 1,305 4,680 Fiscal year 2014 4,351 1,155 3,196 Fiscal year 2015 4,008 1,060 2,948 Fiscal year 2016 1,630 341 1,289 Thereafter 7,105 7,105

Lease Guarantee On April30, 2004, we spun-off our drug discovery subsidiary, Pharmacopeia Drug Discovery, Inc. PDD, into an independent, separately traded, publicly held company through
the distribution to our stockholders of a dividend of one share of PDD common stock for every two shares of our common stock. The landlords of our New Jersey facilities, which were used by our PDD operations, consented to the assignment of the
leases to PDD. Despite the assignment, the landlords required us to guarantee the remaining lease obligations, which totaled approximately $108 million as of December31, 2011. In the event that PDD defaults on their lease obligation, we are
permitted under the guarantee to sublease the facility in order to mitigate our lease obligation. In accordance with ASC Topic 460, we recognized a liability and corresponding charge to stockholders equity for the probability-weighted fair
market value of the guarantee. Changes to the fair market value of the liability are recognized in stockholders equity. The liability for our guarantee of the lease obligation was $03 million at both December31, 2011 and 2010.
Royalties We are obligated to pay royalties for licenses to enhance and market certain software used in connection with our product offerings. Annual contractual minimum royalty payments as of December31,
2011 are as follows in thousands:  Fiscal year 2012 1,399 Fiscal year 2013 436 Fiscal year 2014 436 Fiscal year 2015 436 Fiscal year 2016 436 Thereafter1 1,685

For purposes of the contractual minimum royalty payments table, we have included indefinite-lived contractual minimum royalty payments due in the ten fiscal years
following December31, 2011. 
82 Table of Contents
In addition to the contractual minimum royalties included in the table above, we have
several royalty agreements that are long term or perpetual in nature and the royalty obligations are generally based on a percentage of revenues derived from certain software license sales and associated sales of PCS. The royalty agreements require
quarterly payments and generally do not limit the maximum royalties owed. We incurred royalty related expenses of $58 million, $46 million and $18 million unaudited for the year ended December31, 2011 and the nine months ended
December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $22 million for each of the years ended March31, 2010 and 2009. Litigation
Prior to the completion of the Symyx Merger, several lawsuits were filed against Symyx, the members of the Symyx board
of directors and certain executive officers of Symyx, Accelrys and Merger Sub in purported class action lawsuits brought by individual Symyx stockholders challenging the Symyx Merger. The first of such lawsuits was a class action lawsuit filed in
the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara, purportedly on behalf of the stockholders of Symyx, against Symyx and its directors and chief financial officer, as well as Accelrys and Merger Sub, alleging, among other things,
that Symyxs directors breached their fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Symyx in connection with the proposed Symyx Merger. Subsequent to the filing of such lawsuit, several additional suits were filed, also in Santa Clara County, each of
which was substantially similar to the first lawsuit. The lawsuits were ultimately consolidated into a single action and on May20, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a single consolidated complaint the Complaint. The Complaint served as
the only complaint in the combined litigation going forward the Consolidated Action, which was pending in the Superior Court for the County of Santa Clara the Court. The Complaint, like the previously filed complaints,
alleged, among other things, that Symyxs directors breached their fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Symyx in connection with the Symyx Merger, and was seeking, among other things, to enjoin the defendants from completing the Symyx Merger
pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. On June22, 2010, the defendants entered into a memorandum of
understanding the MOU with the plaintiffs, pursuant to which the defendants and the plaintiffs agreed to settle the Consolidated Action. Subject to court approval and further definitive documentation the MOU resolves the allegations by
the plaintiffs against the defendants made in connection with the Merger and the Merger Agreement, and provides a release and settlement by the purported class of Symyx stockholders with prejudice of all asserted claims against the defendants
without costs to any defendant other than as expressly provided in the MOU, in exchange for Symyxs agreement to provide additional supplemental disclosures to the joint proxy statement/prospectus issued by Accelrys and Symyx in connection
with the Symyx Merger. Accelrys and Symyx made the appropriate supplemental disclosures on June23, 2010. On January28, 2011 the plaintiffs filed the Unopposed Notice of Motion for Preliminary Approval of a Class Action Settlement and
supporting documents. On February25, 2011, the Court signed a preliminary approval order, which granted preliminary certification of a non-opt out class and set a settlement hearing for May6, 2011 to determine whether a final order and
judgment should be granted to settle this matter. On July15, 2011, the Court approved the settlement amount of $03 million, which was paid by our insurance carrier. In addition to the foregoing, we are subject to various claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. While any legal proceeding has an element of uncertainty, management
believes that the disposition of such matters, in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on our results of operations. Other
Guarantees and Indemnifications We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against
claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Although the maximum potential amount of future payments
we could be required to make under these indemnifications is unlimited, to date we have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. Additionally, we have insurance policies that, in
most cases, would limit our exposure and enable us to recover a portion of any amounts paid. Therefore, we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal and the likelihood of incurring an obligation is remote. Accordingly, we have
not accrued any liabilities in connection with these indemnification obligations as of December31, 2011.

On April28, 2011, we renegotiated a sublease for a facility in the UK that was abandoned in 2006
and for which the tenant had exercised a break clause, whereby the tenant reduced the amount of floor space sublet. Additionally, we negotiated the sublease of the remaining floor space with another party. As a result of the change in estimate of
sublease income for this facility, we recorded a net additional $02 million in restructuring expense during the year ended December31, 2011. On April28, 2011, we committed to the implementation of a reduction in force of approximately ten to fifteen employees, in connection with the streamlining of our operations and the integration of
our Content business.As a result, we incurred total severance charges of approximately $10 million during the year ended December31, 2011, of which $06 million have been paid and the remaining balance is expected to be paid during the
first half of fiscal year 2012. In July 2010, as a result of the Symyx Merger, we implemented a plan to terminate the
employment of approximately 80 employees in the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific region. As a result of such terminations, we have incurred total severance charges of approximately $53 million, with $08 million incurred during the year ended
December31, 2011 and $45 million incurred during the nine months ended December31, 2010. As of December31, 2011, $29 million in cash payments had been made and the remaining $24 million will be paid during the first half of
fiscal year 2012. Prior to the Symyx Merger, Symyx had implemented various restructuring plans under which lease obligations
of approximately $01 million remain as of December31, 2011. Additionally, prior to 2007, we had implemented a restructuring plan under which our lease obligations remain. Our remaining lease obligations terminate in 2012, 2016 and 2022,
respectively. All amounts incurred in connection with the above activities are recorded in the Business consolidation,
transaction and restructuring costs recoveries line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 
84 Table of Contents 10.Royalty and Other Income, Net 
Royalty and other income, net includes non-operating items such as interest income, realized investment gains and
losses, unrealized investment gains and losses related to securities determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. It also includes royalty income net of royalty expense and amortization of
purchased intangible assets related to products that are not part of current operations. As part of the Symyx Merger, we have retained the rights to receive royalty income related to the divestiture of the High Productivity Research business unit
previously divested by Symyx. Interest and other income, net consisted of the following: Year Ended Nine Months Ended Years Ended December31,2011 December31,2010 December31,2009 March31,2010 March31,2009 In thousands unaudited Royalty income, net 6,167 1,722 Interest Income 1,486 739 237 314 1,348 Realized gain on investments 248 248 248 Foreign currency transaction gain 530 171 145 361 321 Purchased intangible assets amortization 2,365 1,247 Net Rental Income 311 Write-off of intangible asset in connection with the sale of intellectual property 4,303 Other 86 8 10 9 187

As these amounts are related to intellectual property acquired in the Symyx Merger as described above,
they will be partially offset by amortization expense related to such intellectual property. The income related to these agreements for the year ended December31, 2011 and the nine months ended December31, 2010 is included in the $62
million and the $17 million, respectively, of net royalty income presented above.  11. Subsequent Events On February 29, 2012, our
board of directors authorized the Company to commit up to $20 million for the repurchase of the Companys common stock pursuant to a program to be executed in accordance with a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. With our previously announced
August3, 2011 authorization of up to $80million, we can repurchase up to $100million of the Companys common stock during fiscal 2012 pursuant to a program to be executed in accordance with a Rule10b5-1 trading plan.
We have not made any purchases under these authorizations.

During the quarter ended June30, 2011, we corrected our cost of revenue due to an error related to over accrual of our royalty expense of $04 million for the
nine months ended December31, 2010 and $03 million for the three months ended March31, 2011. In accordance with applicable guidance, management evaluated the materiality of the errors from a qualitative and quantitative perspective.
Based on such evaluation, we concluded that correcting the error of $04 million and $03 million for the nine months ended December31, 2010 and three months ended March31, 2011, respectively, would be immaterial to the full year results
for the year ended December31, 2011 and correcting the error would not have had a material impact on any individual prior period financial statements or affect future financial results. This adjustment related to the over accrual of our
royalty expenses in the quarter ended March31, 2011 resulted in a $03 million favorable change to net loss and no change to basic and diluted net loss per common share in the quarter ended March31, 2011.

Controls and Procedures Conclusion
Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such
term is defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act, that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,

as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosures. As of the end of the period covered by

disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15b and 15d-15b. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective

Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Exchange Act Rules13a-15fand 15d-15f. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate. 
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under such framework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2011. 
Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included
in this Report, has also audited our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, as stated in their report which is included herein. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December31, 2011 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, those controls.
