Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Note A. Business Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  1. About NSTAR  NSTAR or the Company is a holding company engaged through its subsidiaries in the energy delivery business serving approximately 14 million customers in Massachusetts,
including approximately 11 million electric distribution customers in 81 communities and approximately 300,000 natural gas distribution customers in 51 communities. NSTAR was created in 1999 in connection with the merger of BEC Energy and
Commonwealth Energy System. NSTARs retail utility subsidiaries are Boston Edison Company Boston Edison, Commonwealth Electric Company ComElectric, Cambridge Electric Light Company Cambridge Electric and NSTAR Gas Company NSTAR Gas. Its
wholesale electric subsidiary is Canal Electric Company Canal. NSTARs three retail electric companies collectively operate as NSTAR Electric. Reference in this report to NSTAR shall mean the registrant NSTAR or NSTAR
and its subsidiaries as the context requires. Reference in this report to NSTAR Electric shall mean Boston Edison, ComElectric and Cambridge Electric together. NSTARs non-utility, unregulated operations include district energy
operations Advanced Energy Systems, Inc. and NSTAR Steam Corporation, telecommunications operations NSTAR Communications, Inc. NSTAR Com and a liquefied natural gas service company Hopkinton LNG Corp.  2. Basis of Consolidation and Accounting  The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the results of operations,
comprehensive income, retained earnings, financial position and cash flows of NSTAR and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain immaterial reclassifications have been made to prior
year amounts to conform to the current years presentation.  NSTARs
utility subsidiaries follow accounting policies prescribed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC and the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy MDTE. In addition, NSTAR and its subsidiaries are subject to the
accounting and reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP. The utility
subsidiaries are subject to the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation SFAS 71. The application of SFAS 71
results in differences in the timing of recognition of certain expenses from those of other businesses and industries. The distribution and transmission businesses remain subject to rate-regulation and continue to meet the criteria for application
of SFAS 71. Refer to Note D to these Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on regulatory assets.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management of NSTAR and its subsidiaries to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
these estimates.  3. Revenues  Utility revenues are based on authorized rates approved by the MDTE and FERC. Estimates of
distribution and transition revenues for electricity and natural gas delivered to customers but not yet billed are accrued at the end of each accounting period. 
Revenues for NSTARs non-utility subsidiaries are recognized when services are rendered or when the energy is delivered. 
49 Table of Contents
4. Utility Plant  Utility plant is stated at original cost. The cost of replacements of property units are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs and
replacements of minor items are expensed as incurred. The original cost of property retired, net of salvage value, is charged to accumulated depreciation. The incurred related cost of removal is charged against the Regulatory liability - cost of
removal.  5. Non-Utility Plant  Non-utility property is stated at cost or its net realizable value. The following is a
summary of non-utility property and equipment, at cost less accumulated depreciation, at December 31:  in thousands
2004 2003 Land 15,700 15,604 Energy production equipment 136,929 132,487 Telecommunications equipment 39,287 38,314 Gas storage 42,701 42,701 Buildings and improvements 2,992 2,992 237,609 232,098 Less: accumulated depreciation 83,104 72,123 154,505 159,975 Construction work in progress 458 581 154,963 160,556  6.
Depreciation  Depreciation of utility plant is computed on a straight-line
basis using composite rates based on the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property. The composite rates are subject to the approval of the MDTE and FERC. The overall composite depreciation rates for utility property were 302%, 304%
and 326% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The rates include a cost of removal component, which is collected from customers.  Depreciation of non-utility property is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset. The estimated depreciable service lives in years of the
major components of non-utility property and equipment are as follows:  Plant Component
DepreciableLife
Energy production equipment
25-35
Telecommunications equipment
10
Liquefied gas storage facilities
28
Buildings and improvements
40
Depreciation expense on non-utility
property and equipment was $13 million, $12 million and $9 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  7. Costs Associated with Issuance and Redemption of Debt and Preferred Stock  Consistent with the recovery in utility rates, discounts, redemption premiums and related
costs associated with the issuance and redemption of long-term debt and preferred stock are deferred and amortized as an addition to interest expense over the life of the original or replacement debt. Costs related to preferred stock issuances and
redemptions are reflected as a direct reduction to retained earnings upon redemption or over the average life of the replacement preferred stock series as applicable. 
50 Table of Contents
8. Allowance for Borrowed Funds Used During Construction AFUDC/Capitalized Interest
AFUDC represents the estimated costs to finance utility plant construction.
In accordance with regulatory accounting, AFUDC is included as a cost of utility plant and a reduction of current interest charges. Although AFUDC is not a current source of cash income, the costs are recovered from customers over the service life
of the related plant in the form of increased revenues collected as a result of higher depreciation expense. Average AFUDC rates in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were 172%, 160% and 226%, respectively, and represented only the costs of short-term debt.
NSTAR capitalizes interest costs on long-term construction projects related to
its unregulated businesses. Interest costs of $37 million during 2003 were capitalized for the construction of new combustion turbines at AES MATEP facility. No interest costs were capitalized during 2004.  9. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash  Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are comprised of liquid securities with
maturities of 90 days or less when purchased. Restricted cash primarily represents the remainder of the net proceeds from the sale of Canals generation assets that are required to be used to reduce the transition costs that otherwise would be
billed to customers, funds held by a trustee in connection with Advanced Energy Systems 6924% Note Agreement, and funds held in reserve for a trust on behalf of Boston Edison to pay the principal and interest on the transition property
securitization.  NSTARs banking arrangements provide for daily cash
transfers to our disbursement accounts as vendor checks are presented for payment. The balances of the disbursement accounts amount to $26,165 and $14,243 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and are included in accounts payable on the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the balances of the disbursement accounts are reflected in financing activities in the accompanying Statement of Cash Flows.  10. Equity Method of Accounting  NSTAR uses the equity method of accounting for investments in corporate joint ventures in which it does not have a controlling interest.
Under this method, it records as income or loss the proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of the joint ventures with a corresponding increase or decrease in the carrying value of the investment. The investment is reduced as cash
dividends are received. NSTAR participates in several corporate joint ventures in which it has investments, principally its 145% equity investment in two companies that own and operate transmission facilities to import electricity from the
Hydro-Quebec System in Canada, and its equity investments ranging from 4% to 14% in three regional nuclear facilities that are currently being decommissioned. 
11. Goodwill and Costs to Achieve  The merger that created NSTAR was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The premium Goodwill associated with the acquisition was approximately $490
million, while the original estimate of transaction and integration costs to achieve the merger was $111 million. The merger premium is reflected on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as Goodwill. In accordance with the MDTEs order,
this premium is being amortized over 40 years at an annual rate of $122 million, while the costs to achieve CTA are being amortized over 10 years. CTA are the costs incurred to execute the merger including the costs of a voluntary severance
program, costs of financial advisors, legal costs, and other transaction and systems integration costs. CTA was being amortized at an annual rate of $111 million through the rate freeze period based on the original rate plan, as approved by the
MDTE. Effective upon completion of the four-year rate freeze on August 25, 2003, the amortization expense was increased to reflect the actual CTA expenditures incurred. As a result, the total CTA amortization expense for 2004 and 2003 was
approximately $164 million and $129 million, respectively. In 2003, NSTAR, as mandated by the MDTE, filed a Revised Savings Report which detailed the actual realized savings as a result of the merger that created NSTAR. The filing included an
update on the actual CTA costs 
51 Table of Contents
incurred. This report included a final accounting of the deductibility for income tax purposes of each component of CTA. In 2004, the MDTE determined that no
further action was required on the Revised Savings Report. The total CTA is approximately $143 million. This increase from the original estimate is partially mitigated by the fact that the portion of CTA that is not deductible for income tax
purposes is approximately $20 million lower than the original estimate. NSTAR anticipates that these incremental costs are probable of recovery in future rates. The CTA and Goodwill amounts were filed and approved as part of the rate plan.
12. Stock Option Plan  NSTARs 1997 Share Incentive Plan is a stock-based employee compensation plan and is
described more fully in the accompanying Note J to Consolidated Financial Statements. NSTAR applies the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB
25 and related Interpretations in accounting for this plan. Currently, no stock-based employee compensation expense for option grants is reflected in net income, as all options granted under this plan had an exercise price equal to the market value
of the underlying common shares on the date of grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per common share if NSTAR had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based

New Accounting Standards  In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R,
Share-Based Payment. This Standard addresses the accounting for transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the company or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the
companys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. This Standard eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Standard is effective for periods beginning after June 15, 2005. NSTAR is currently assessing the
valuation options allowed in this Standard but, preliminarily, expects this Standard to impact annual earnings by approximately $15 million pre-tax, or $002 per share.  15. Purchases and Sales Transactions with Independent System Operator - New England ISO-NE  As part of NSTAR Electrics normal business operations in order to meet its energy
obligation to its standard offer customers, NSTAR Electric entered into hourly transactions to purchase or sell energy supply to its ISO-NE. The NSTAR Electric transactions with the ISO-NE have been treated as the ISO-NE servicing the incremental
needs of NSTAR Electric, that is, transactions with ISO-NE associated with the difference between NSTAR Electrics resource needs compared to NSTAR Electrics resource availability. NSTAR Electric records the net effect of transactions
with the ISO-NE as an adjustment to purchased power expense.  During 2004 and
2003, NSTAR Electric entered into an agreement whereby all of its energy supply resource entitlements are transferred to an independent energy supplier, following which NSTAR Electric repurchases its energy resource needs from this independent
energy supplier for NSTAR Electrics ultimate sale to its standard offer customers. This transaction has been and will continue to be recorded as a net purchase of electricity.  Note B. Earnings Per Common Share  Basic earnings per common share EPS is calculated by dividing net income, after deductions for preferred dividends, by the weighted average common shares outstanding
during the year. SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share, requires the disclosure of diluted EPS. Diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the weighted average common shares are increased to include the number of
potential dilutive common shares. Diluted EPS reflects the impact on shares outstanding of the deferred nonvested shares and stock options granted under the NSTAR Share Incentive Plan.

Obligations  On January 1, 2003, NSTAR adopted SFAS No. 143,
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143. SFAS 143 establishes accounting and reporting standards for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. It
applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or the normal operation of a long-lived asset, except for certain obligations under lease arrangements.
SFAS 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount
of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the
obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement.  NSTAR has identified certain immaterial long-lived assets, including obligations under lease and easement arrangements, and has determined that it is legally responsible to remove such property.  For its regulated utility businesses, NSTAR has identified legal retirement obligations that
are currently not material to its financial statements. The recognition of a potential asset retirement obligation will have no impact on its earnings. In accordance with SFAS 71, for NSTARs rate-regulated utilities, NSTAR would establish
regulatory assets or liabilities to defer any differences between the liabilities established for ratemaking purposes and those recorded as required under SFAS 143.  For NSTARs regulated utility businesses, the ultimate cost to remove utility plant from service cost of removal is recognized as a
component of depreciation expense in accordance with approved regulatory treatment. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the estimated amount of the cost of removal included in regulatory liabilities was approximately $259 million and $223 million,
respectively, based on the estimated cost of removal component in current depreciation rates.  NSTAR has identified several long-lived assets, in which it has legal obligations to remove such property, for its non-regulated businesses. As a result, in 2003, NSTAR recorded an increase in non-utility plant of
approximately $06 million, an asset retirement liability of approximately $1 million and a cumulative effect of adoption after tax, reducing net income by $04 million in 2003. The cumulative effect adjustment was recorded as part of 2003
Depreciation and amortization expense on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  During 2004, the FASB issued an exposure draft, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. The interpretation clarifies when an entity would be
required to recognize a liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation that is conditional on a future event if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. Uncertainty surrounding the timing and method of settlement
that may be conditional on events occurring in the future would be factored into the measurement of the liability 
54 Table of Contents
rather than the recognition of the liability. The interpretation would be effective for NSTAR no later than the end of fiscal year 2005. NSTAR is currently
assessing the impact that the interpretation will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operation and cash flows.  Note D. Regulatory Assets  Regulatory assets represent costs incurred that are expected to be collected from customers through future rates in accordance with agreements with regulators. These
costs are expensed when the corresponding revenues are received in order to appropriately match revenues and expenses.  Regulatory assets consisted of the following:  December 31 in thousands

requirements model, electric and gas rates are based on the cost of providing energy delivery service. Under this model, NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas are subject to certain accounting standards that are not applicable to other businesses and
industries in general. The application of SFAS 71 requires companies to defer the recognition of certain costs when incurred if future rate recovery of these costs is expected. This is applicable to NSTARs electric and gas distribution and
transmission operations.  Power contracts  The unamortized balance of the estimated costs to decommission the Connecticut Yankee CY,
Yankee Atomic YA and Maine Yankee MY nuclear power plants was $1166 million at December 31, 2004. NSTARs liability for CY decommissioning and its recovery ends in 2010, for YA in 2010 and for MY in 2010. However, should the actual costs
exceed current estimates and anticipated decommissioning dates, NSTAR could have an obligation beyond these periods that would be fully recoverable. These costs are recovered through NSTAR Electrics transition charge. Refer to Note Q,
Commitments and Contingencies, for more discussion.  In
addition, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, $4723 million and $6658 million, respectively, represents the recognition of four purchase power contracts at December 31, 2004 and six purchase power contracts at December 31, 2003 as derivatives and their
above-market value and future recovery through NSTAR Electrics transition charges. Refer to Note F, Derivative Instruments - Power Contracts for further details.  The remaining balance at December 31, 2004 of $8521 million represents the recognition of eight purchase power contract buy-out agreements
that NSTAR Electric executed in 2004 and their future recovery through NSTAR Electrics transition charges. Refer to Note O, Contracts for the Purchase of Energy for further details.  Retiree benefit costs  The retiree benefit regulatory asset of $346 million is comprised of $174 million of
carrying charges related to a 2003 MDTE order, which will be recovered from customers in 2005, and, $128 million of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations other than pension PBOP costs deferred under the MDTE order in 2003 and
55 Table of Contents
2004. Deferred pension and PBOP costs are amortized and collected from customers over three years. The remaining balance of $44 million relates to other
pension and PBOP costs deferred in accordance with MDTE directives. These costs are being amortized over periods ranging from two to nine years. Refer to Note I of these Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the MDTE
order.  In 2003, the retiree benefit regulatory asset also included
approximately $2993 million, which represented the additional minimum pension liability charge required under SFAS 87. As of December 31, 2004, NSTARs Pension Plan did not incur an additional minimum pension liability. As a result, the
liability was reversed. Refer to Note H, Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits for further details.  Generation-related plant  Plant and other regulatory assets related to the divestiture of NSTARs generation business are recovered with a return through the transition charge. This recovery
occurs through 2019 for Boston Edison and through 2023 for ComElectric. This schedule is subject to adjustment by the MDTE.  As of December 31, 2004, $3572 million of these generation-related regulatory assets are collateralized with the Transition Property Securitization Certificates held by
Boston Edisons subsidiary, BEC Funding LLC. The certificates are non-recourse to Boston Edison.  Merger costs to achieve  An integral part of the merger was the MDTE-approved rate plan of the retail utility subsidiaries of NSTAR. Significant elements of the rate plan include a four-year
distribution rate freeze, recovery of the acquisition premium goodwill over 40 years and recovery of transaction and integration costs costs to achieve over 10 years. Costs to achieve were the costs incurred to execute the merger including costs
for a voluntary severance program, costs of financial advisors, legal costs and other transaction and systems integration costs. These costs are collected from all NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas distribution customers and exclude a return component.
The amortization of these costs have been adjusted since the original recovery began to reflect the actual costs incurred. Refer to Note A to these Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on merger costs to achieve. 
Income taxes, net  The principal holder of this regulatory asset is Boston Edison. Approximately $29 million of
this regulatory asset balance reflects deferred tax reserve deficiencies that are being recovered from customers over a 17-year period. In addition, approximately $37 million in additional Boston Edison deferred tax reserve deficiencies have been
recorded in accordance with an MDTE-approved settlement agreement. Offsetting these amounts is approximately $16 million of a regulatory liability associated with unamortized investment tax credits relating to NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas.
Purchased power costs  The purchased power costs relate to deferred standard offer service and deferred default
service costs. Customers have the option of continuing to buy power from the retail electric distribution businesses at standard offer prices through February 2005. Since 1998, NSTAR has been allowed to defer the difference between the standard
offer and default service revenues and the cost to supply the power, plus carrying costs. Default service is the electricity that is supplied by the local distribution company when a customer is not receiving power from standard offer service and
has not chosen to receive service from a competitive supplier. The market price for standard offer and default service may fluctuate based on the average market price for power. Amounts collected through standard offer and default service are
recovered on a fully reconciling basis.  Redemption premiums
These amounts reflect the unamortized balance of redemption premiums on
Boston Edison Debentures that are amortized and recovered over the life of the respective debentures pursuant to MDTE approval. There is no return recognized on this balance. 
56 Table of Contents
Other  These amounts primarily consist of deferred transmission costs that are set to be recovered over a subsequent twelve-month period. The deferred costs represent the
difference between the level of billed transmission revenues and the current period costs incurred to provide transmission-related services.  Also, included are environmental costs and response costs that represent the recovery of costs to clean up former gas manufacturing sites over a 7-year period without a
return.  Note E. Derivative Instruments - Power Contracts  NSTAR accounts for its power contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133 and DIG interpretations. NSTAR, at December 31, 2004, recorded four contracts at fair value on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2003, NSTAR recorded six purchase power
contracts at fair value. Two of the six contracts were divested in 2004 through regulatory-approved buy-out agreements. Refer to Note O of these Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail on the purchase power contract
buy-outs/restructurings. As a result, the recognition of a liability for the fair value of the above-market portion of the remaining four contracts at December 31, 2004 and for the fair value of the above-market portion of the six contracts at
December 31, 2003 is approximately $472 million and $666 million and is a component of Deferred credits - Power contracts on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. NSTAR has recorded a corresponding regulatory asset to reflect the future
recovery of the above-market component of these contracts through its electric distribution companies transition charge. Therefore, as a result of this regulatory treatment, the recording of these contracts on the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets does not result in an earnings impact.  During the first quarter
of 2005, NSTAR expects to close on a securitization financing that will affect these four contracts that are classified as derivative instruments. NSTAR Electric has entered into buy-out agreements for all four contracts and expects to finance the
buy-out payments through a securitization financing. When this occurs, the fair value of these four contracts will be removed as a derivative instrument from the balance sheet and the securitization debt obligation will be recorded along with an
offsetting regulatory asset.  NSTAR has other purchase power contracts in which
the contract value is significantly above-market. However, these contracts have met the criteria for the normal purchases and sales exception pursuant to SFAS 133 and DIG interpretations and have not been recorded on the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets. The above-market portion of these contracts is currently being recovered through the electric distribution companies transition charge. Therefore, NSTAR does not account for these types of capacity and energy contracts, gas
supply contracts, or purchase orders for numerous supply arrangements as derivatives.  Note F. Variable Interest Entities  In January 2003, the FASB
issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, as revised in December 2003 FIN 46R, which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities VIE by business enterprises that are the primary
beneficiaries. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling
financial interest. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the enterprise with the majority of the risks or rewards associated with the VIE. This interpretation had two effective dates: December 31, 2003 and March 31, 2004.  NSTAR has a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary, BEC Funding LLC, established to
undertake the sale of $725 million in notes to a special purpose trust created by two Massachusetts state agencies. NSTAR consolidates this entity. As part of NSTARs assessment of FIN 46R and, for compliance at December 31, 2003, NSTAR
reviewed the substance of this entity to determine if it is still proper to consolidate this entity. Based on its review, NSTAR has concluded that BEC Funding LLC is a VIE and should continue to be consolidated by NSTAR. 
57 Table of Contents
For the March 31, 2004 effective date of FIN 46R, NSTAR evaluated other entities with which it conducts significant
transactions, including companies that supply power to NSTAR Electric through its purchase power agreements. NSTAR determined that it is possible that five of these companies may be considered VIEs. These companies have power plants that have daily
capacity output ranging from 20 megawatts MW to 330 MW. Through December 31, 2004 and 2003, NSTAR Electric purchased a total of approximately 4,001 megawatt-hours MWH and 4,487 MWH, respectively, under these agreements. These purchases
approximate 17% of the total MWH purchased by NSTAR Electric for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 and amounted to approximately $381 million and $386 million, respectively. In order to determine if these counterparties are VIEs and if
NSTAR Electric is the primary beneficiary of these counterparties, NSTAR Electric concluded that it needed more information from the entities. NSTAR Electric attempted to obtain the information required and requested, in writing, these entities
provide the Company with the necessary information. However, each of the entities has indicated that they will not provide the requested information as they are not contractually obligated to provide such confidential information. Since NSTAR
Electric was unable to obtain the necessary information and, as allowed under a scope exception in FIN 46R, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements do not reflect the consolidation of any entities with which NSTAR Electric has a purchase
power agreement.  Additionally, during 2004, NSTAR Electric executed purchase
power buy-out/restructuring agreements with a majority of the entities from which NSTAR Electric attempted to obtain additional information in order to determine if these entities are VIEs. These buy-out/restructurings agreements received regulatory
approval in January 2005. Refer to Note O for more detail on the purchase power agreements. As a result, NSTAR will no longer pursue obtaining the necessary information to determine whether it has a variable interest in these entities.
Note G. Income Taxes  Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes SFAS 109. SFAS 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. In accordance with SFAS 71
and SFAS 109, net regulatory assets of $503 million and $502 million and corresponding net increases in accumulated deferred income taxes were recorded as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The regulatory assets represent the additional
future revenues to be collected from customers for deferred income taxes.  Accumulated deferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax credits consisted of the following:  December 31 in thousands

a. RCN Abandonment Tax Treatment  As a result of the RCN share abandonment, the Company claimed an ordinary loss on its 2003
tax return for this item. The ordinary loss tax treatment resulted in the Company realizing the benefits represented by the tax asset recorded on its books that resulted from the previous write-down of this asset for financial reporting purposes.
The requirement for a tax valuation allowance, therefore, is no longer applicable. Accordingly, the Company reversed this reserve as of December 31, 2003.  The Company believes it is more likely than not that it is entitled to this ordinary loss deduction. The Company expects the Internal Revenue Service IRS to review this
transaction and it is possible that the IRS will disagree. In accordance with the Companys tax policy as it relates to uncertain tax positions, the Company has established a loss contingency of approximately $44 million at December 31, 2003.
This amount represents the tax impact to the Company should the ordinary loss ultimately be recharacterized to a capital loss. This contingent liability is recorded as part of Deferred credits - Other on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
If the Companys position is not upheld, the Company may be required to
make future cash expenditures to the IRS that may impact NSTARs cash requirements in future periods. 
59 Table of Contents
b. Tax Valuation Allowance  SFAS 109 prohibits the recognition of all or a portion of deferred income tax benefits if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax
asset will not be realized. NSTAR had determined that it was more likely than not that a current or future income tax benefit would not be realized relating to the write-downs of its RCN investment that were recorded in the second and fourth
quarters of 2002 and previously in the first quarter of 2001. These write-downs resulted from the significant declines in the market value of the telecommunications sector, including RCN. As a result of this uncertainty, NSTAR recorded a $776
million tax valuation allowance on the entire tax benefit associated with these write-downs during 2001 and 2002. During 2003 and 2002, as a result of previously unanticipated capital gain transactions, NSTAR recognized $85 million and $39
million, respectively, of this tax benefit.  Additionally, based on the IRS
review of NSTARs 1999 and 2000 federal income tax returns, NSTAR recognized the tax benefits relating to the incremental operating losses from the joint venture that were allocated to NSTAR. These tax returns are currently at the Office of IRS
Appeals on other matters. The tax valuation allowance included reserves related to the tax treatment of these losses through June 19, 2002, the final date of joint venture loss allocation to NSTAR. Each of the tax returns filed for 1999 through 2001
claimed operating losses. The tax return filed for 2002 claimed the remaining portion of these operating losses. Based on the IRS examining agents review, no adjustment for the years under audit was proposed. This determination was arrived at
in the fourth quarter of 2002 and, as a result, NSTAR applied the treatment of these operating losses for all years on a consistent basis, allowing a reduction to its valuation allowance of approximately $197 million as a reduction to income tax
expense included as a component of the write-down of the RCN investment.  On
December 24, 2003, NSTAR exited from its investment in RCN and formally abandoned the 116 million shares of RCN common stock. As mentioned above, a tax valuation allowance had been established in a previous year to offset the potential future tax
benefits resulting from write-downs of NSTARs investment in RCN. As a result of the abandonment, the Company claimed an ordinary loss on its 2003 tax return. This treatment results in the Company realizing the benefits represented by the tax
asset recorded on its books that resulted from the previous write-downs of this investment for financial reporting purposes. The requirement for a tax valuation allowance, therefore, no longer exists. As a result, the Company reduced the remaining
valuation allowance from approximately $53 million at December 31, 2002 to zero at December 31, 2003. See a further discussion on this matter in Note Q, Commitments and Contingencies.  c. Tax Gain on Generating Assets  The cost of transitioning to retail open access was mitigated, in part, by the sale of
Commonwealth Energy Systems COM/Energy now a wholly owned subsidiary of NSTAR non-nuclear generating assets. COM/Energy completed the sale of substantially all of its non-nuclear generating assets in 1998. Proceeds from the sale of these
assets amounted to approximately $4539 million, or 61 times their book value of approximately $742 million. The proceeds from the sale, net of book value, transaction costs and certain other adjustments amounted to $3586 million and are required
to be used for the benefit of COM/Energy customers under MDTE rate setting policies. In this instance, the amount was used to reduce transition costs of Cambridge Electric and ComElectric related to electric industry restructuring. COM/Energy
determined that this transaction was not a taxable event because it did not provide an economic benefit to its shareholders.  In order to complete its audit of COM/Energys tax returns for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999, the IRS needed to determine whether this transaction was taxable. The
local IRS examining agent filed a Request for Technical Advice with its National Office on June 5, 2003.  On August 28, 2003, NSTAR received a response from the IRS National Office to a Request for Technical Advice, requesting advice as to whether the gain on the sale of the COM/Energy non-nuclear generating assets in
1998 was a taxable transaction. The Technical Advice Memorandum upheld COM/Energys position. This ruling now completes the audits by the IRS of COM/Energys 1997, 1998 and 1999 federal income tax returns. This decision did not require the
Company to make tax and interest payments to the IRS of approximately $140 million.

Note H. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  1. Pension  NSTAR sponsors a defined benefit retirement plan, the NSTAR Pension Plan the Plan, that covers substantially all employees. NSTAR also maintains nonqualified retirement
plans for certain management employees.  The Plan uses December 31st for the measurement date to determine its projected benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and net periodic benefit
costs for the following year.  The changes in benefit obligation and Plan
assets were as follows:  December 31 in thousands

The accumulated benefit obligation for the qualified retirement plan as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $870,730,000
and $843,609,000, respectively.  The projected benefit obligation, accumulated
benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the nonqualified retirement plan were $36,415,000, $31,297,000 and $0, respectively, as of December 31, 2004 and $34,317,000, $32,176,000 and $0, respectively, as of December 31, 2003.

The primary investment goal of the Plan is to achieve a total annualized return of 9% before expenses over the
long-term and to minimize unsystematic risk so that no single security or class of securities will have a disproportionate impact on the Plan. Risk is regularly evaluated, compared and benchmarked to plans with a similar investment strategy. NSTAR
currently uses 18 asset managers to manage its plan assets. Assets are diversified by both asset class i.e., equities, bonds and within these classes i.e., economic sector, industry, such that, for each asset manager:  No more than 6% of an asset managers equity portfolio market value may be invested in one company  Each portfolio should be invested in at least 20 different companies in different industries, and  No more than 50% of each portfolios market value may be invested in one industry sector.  Each asset manager may invest in domestic and international fixed income investments and may include government obligations, corporate
bonds, preferred stock, and asset-backed securities. In addition, no one asset manager may invest in more than 5% of any one security of an issuer, except the U.S. Government and its agencies.  Funded Status  At December 31, 2003, the accumulated benefit obligation of NSTARs qualified Plan
exceeded Plan assets. Therefore, NSTAR was required to recognize an additional minimum liability adjustment as prescribed by SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions SFAS 87 and SFAS No. 132, Employers
Disclosures about Pensions and Postretirement Benefits.  As a result of
the additional minimum pension liability adjustment, the prepaid pension balance is removed from the balance sheet and a liability is recorded for the difference between the ABO and the plan assets. The net effect of this entry would ordinarily be
recorded, net of taxes, as a non-cash charge to Other Comprehensive Income OCI on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and would not affect the results of operations.  On October 31, 2003, the MDTE approved NSTARs request for a reconciliation rate
adjustment mechanism related to pension and PBOP costs. As part of this ruling, NSTAR is allowed to record a regulatory asset in lieu of taking a charge to OCI for the additional minimum liability adjustment. As of December 31, 2003, NSTAR recorded
a regulatory asset of $299 million as the additional minimum liability adjustment. The regulatory asset is shown as part of Deferred debits in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of Plan assets and the ABO are measured at
each year-end balance sheet date. The minimum liability is adjusted each year to reflect this measurement. When Plan assets exceed the ABO, the minimum liability is reversed. In 2004, due to positive Plan investment performance and Company
contributions over the last two years of approximately $120 million, the fair value of the Plans assets exceeded the Plans ABO at December 31, 2004. As a result, the minimum liability and regulatory asset have been removed and the
prepaid pension balance has been restored to the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet  NSTAR anticipates contributing approximately $35 million to the Plan in 2005.  The estimated benefit payments for the years after 2004 are as follows:  in thousands 2005 60,574

2. Other Postretirement Benefits  NSTAR also provides health care and other benefits to retired employees who meet certain age
and years of service eligibility requirements. These benefits include health and life insurance coverage and until April 1, 2003 included reimbursement of certain Medicare premiums for certain retirees. Under certain circumstances, eligible retirees
are required to make contributions for postretirement benefits.  In December
2003, the FASB issued Staff Position FSP 106-1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act. The Act provides for prescription drug benefits for
retirees over the age of 65 under a new Medicare Part D program. For employers like NSTAR, who currently provide retiree medical programs for former employees over the age of 65, there are subsidies available that are inherent in the Act. The Act
potentially entitles these employers to a direct tax-exempt federal subsidy. Pursuant to FSP 106-1, NSTAR elected to defer recognition of the provisions of this Act until further accounting guidance became effective.  In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP 106-2 effective July 2004 retroactive to January 1, 2004
to provide guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Act. The guidance requires that, when an employer initially accounts for the effects of the Act, the impact on the accumulated postretirement benefits obligation APBO should be accounted
for as an actuarial gain assuming, no plan amendments are made. In accordance with this provision, NSTARs APBO was reduced approximately $51 million. In addition, since the subsidy affects the employers share of its plans costs,
the subsidy is included in measuring the costs of benefits attributable to current service. Therefore, the subsidy reduces service cost when it is recognized as a component of net periodic postretirement benefits cost. NSTARs adoption of FSP
106-2 resulted in a reduction to the 2004 net periodic postretirement benefit cost of approximately $7 million. However, due to the Companys pension and other postretirement benefits rate reconciliation adjustment mechanism that went into

Plan are held in voluntary employees beneficiary association trusts.  The
plans primary investment goal is to outperform the return of the composite benchmark. The portfolio also seeks a level of volatility, which approximates that of the composite benchmark returns.  3. Savings Plan  NSTAR also provides a defined contribution 401k plan for substantially all employees.
Matching contributions which are equal to 50% of the employees deferral up to 8% of eligible compensation included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income amounted to $8 million in 2004 and $9 million in 2003 and 2002.
Effective January 1, 2002, consistent with the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, the plan was amended to allow for increased maximum annual pre-tax contributions and additional catch-up pre-tax contributions for
participants age 50 or older, acceptance of other types of roll-over pre-tax funds from other plans and the option of reinvesting dividends paid on the NSTAR Common Share Fund or receiving such dividends in cash. The election to reinvest
dividends paid on the NSTAR Common Share Fund or receive the dividends in cash is subject to a freeze period beginning seven days prior to the date any dividend is paid. During this period, participants cannot change their election. Dividends are
paid to this plan four times a year on February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1.  Note I. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions PBOP Adjustment Mechanism Tariff Filing  On October 31, 2003, NSTAR received an order from the MDTE regarding NSTARs request filed on April 16, 2003 for the approval of a reconciliation rate adjustment
mechanism PAM for recovery of costs associated with the Companys obligation to provide its employees qualified pension and PBOP benefits. Prior to the PAM order, the Company had accounted for these obligations in accordance with an
Accounting Order received from the MDTE in December 2002.  The PAM order
authorizes NSTAR to recover its qualified pension and PBOP expenses through a reconciling rate mechanism. This mechanism removes the volatility in earnings that may have resulted from requirements of existing accounting standards and provides for an
annual filing and rate adjustment with the MDTE. This order effectuates the 
66 Table of Contents
Accounting Order, which allowed NSTAR to record a regulatory asset in lieu of taking a charge to OCI at December 31, 2002 for the additional minimum
liability in accordance with SFAS 87. In addition, the order revised the effective date included in the Accounting Order on which the Company could begin to defer the difference between the level of qualified pension and PBOP expense included in
rates and the amounts that are required to be recorded under the pension and PBOP accounting rules to September 1, 2003. This date coincides to the expiration of NSTARs utility subsidiaries four-year distribution rate freeze. As a
result, NSTAR recognized $180 million of expenses in the third quarter of 2003 that had been deferred earlier in the year. In accordance with the PAM order, the Company recognized in 2003 $163 million of revenue related to carrying charges on the
net prepaid balance. This carrying charge was collected from customers during 2004. In 2004, the Company recognized $174 million of revenue related to carrying charges on the net prepaid balance. This carrying charge will be collected from
customers during 2005.  On November 20, 2003, both NSTAR and the Massachusetts
Attorney General filed motions with the MDTE for reconsideration of its PAM order. On November 19, 2004, the MDTE denied the request for reconsideration for both NSTAR and the Massachusetts Attorney General.  Note J. Stock-Based Compensation  NSTARs Share Incentive Plan the Plan permits a variety of stock and stock-based
awards, including stock options and deferred non-vested stock to be granted to key employees. The Plan limits the terms of awards to ten years. Subject to adjustment for stock-splits and similar events, the aggregate number of common shares that
may be awarded under the Plan is four million as a result of an amendment to the Plan approved by shareholders in 2002 that increased the number of shares available for issuance from two million to four million, including shares issued in lieu of or
upon reinvestment of dividends arising from awards. The weighted average grant date fair value of the deferred stock issued during 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $4841, $4320 and $4524, respectively. During 2004, 108,350 deferred shares and 316,000
ten-year non-qualified stock options were granted under the Plan. During 2003, 109,900 deferred shares and 324,000 ten-year non-qualified stock options were granted under the Plan. During 2002, 95,300 deferred shares and 265,000 ten-year
non-qualified stock options were granted. The options were granted at the full market price of the common shares on the date of the grant. All the awards vest ratably over a three-year period.  Stock option activity of the Plan was as follows:  2004Activity WeightedAverageExercisePrice

Boston Edison issued $300 million of ten-year fixed rate 4875% Debentures. The net proceeds were used to repay outstanding short-term debt balances incurred, in part, to pay the redemption price of the 780% Debentures. The premium paid to redeem
the 780% Debentures will be amortized over ten years, the term of the new 4875% Debentures.

Sewage facility revenue bonds are tax-exempt, subject to annual mandatory sinking fund redemption requirements and mature
through 2015. Scheduled redemptions of $165 million were made in 2004 and 2003. The interest rate of the bonds was 7375% for both 2004 and 2003.  The 575% tax-exempt unsecured MIFA bonds due 2014 were redeemable beginning in February 2004 at a redemption price of 102%. The redemption price decreases to 101% in
February 2005 and to par in February 2006.  The aggregate principal amounts of
NSTAR long-term debt including securitization certificates and sinking fund requirements due in the five years subsequent to 2004 are approximately $149 million in 2005, $248 million in 2006, $83 million in 2007, $86 million in 2008 and $76
million in 2009.  2. Financial Covenant
Requirements  NSTAR and Boston Edison have no financial covenant requirements
under their respective long-term debt arrangements. ComElectric, Cambridge Electric and NSTAR Gas have financial covenant requirements under their long-term debt arrangements and were in compliance at December 31, 2004 and 2003. NSTARs
long-term debt other than the Mortgage Bonds/Notes of NSTAR Gas and Medical Area Total Energy Plant, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of AES, is unsecured.  The Transition Property Securitization Certificates held by Boston Edisons subsidiary, BEC Funding LLC, are collaterized with a securitized regulatory asset with a
balance of $3572 million and $4254 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Boston Edison, as servicing agent for BEC Funding LLC, collected $960 million in 2004. These Certificates are non-recourse to Boston Edison.  In November 2004, NSTAR restructured its three-year, $175 million revolving credit agreement
that was set to expire on November 14, 2005 into a five-year, $175 million revolving credit agreement that expires in November 2009. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, there were no amounts outstanding under the current and previous revolving credit
agreement. This credit facility serves as a backup to NSTARs $175 million commercial paper program that, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, had $5 million and $15 million outstanding, respectively. Under the terms of the current credit agreement,
NSTAR is required to maintain a maximum total consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than 65% at all times, excluding Transition Property Securitization Certificates, and excluding Accumulated other comprehensive income
loss from Common equity. The previous arrangement also required NSTAR to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest and taxes to consolidated total interest expense of not less than 2 to 1 for each period of four consecutive fiscal
quarters. Commitment fees must be paid on the total agreement amount. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, NSTAR was in full compliance with all of the aforementioned covenants.  In December 2003, Boston Edison filed a shelf registration with the SEC to allow Boston Edison to issue up to $500 million in debt
securities. The registration became effective on January 9, 2004. On April 1, 2004, the MDTE approved the issuance by Boston Edison of up to $500 million of debt securities from time to time on or before December 31, 2005. On April 16, 2004, Boston
Edison sold $300 million of ten-year fixed rate 4875% Debentures under this shelf registration. The net proceeds were primarily used to repay outstanding short-term debt balances.  As of September 28, 2004, Boston Edison has approval from the FERC to issue short-term debt securities from time to time on or before
December 31, 2006, with maturity dates no later than December 31, 2007, in amounts such that the aggregate principal does not exceed $450 million at any one time. In addition, in November 2004, Boston Edison restructured its $350 million revolving
credit agreement that expired in November 2004 into a five-year, $350 million revolving credit agreement that expires in November 2009. However, unless Boston Edison receives necessary approvals from the MDTE, the credit agreement will expire 364
days from the date of the first draw under the agreement. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, there were no amounts outstanding under 
70 Table of Contents
the current and previous revolving credit agreement. This credit facility serves as backup to Boston Edisons $350 million commercial paper program that
had a $465 million and $1825 million balance at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Under the terms of the current agreement, Boston Edison is required to maintain a consolidated maximum total debt to capitalization ratio of not greater than
65% at all times, excluding Transition Property Securitization Certificates, and excluding Accumulated other comprehensive income loss from Common equity. The previous agreement required a total debt to capitalization ratio of not greater than
60%. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Boston Edison was in full compliance with all of its covenants in connection with its short-term credit facilities.  In addition, as of December 31, 2004, ComElectric, Cambridge Electric and NSTAR Gas, collectively, have $145 million available under several lines of credit and had
$1099 million and $551 million outstanding under these lines of credit at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As of September 28, 2004, ComElectric and Cambridge Electric have FERC authorization to issue short-term debt securities from
time-to-time on or before November 30, 2006 and June 27, 2006, with maturity dates no later than November 30, 2007 and June 27, 2007, respectively, in amounts such that the aggregate principal does not exceed $125 million and $60 million,
respectively, at any one time. NSTAR Gas is not required to seek approval from FERC to issue short-term debt.  Interest rates on the outstanding borrowings generally are money market rates and averaged 138% and 128% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In aggregate, short-term borrowings totaled $1614 million and $2391 million
at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Note M. Fair Value of
Financial Instruments  The following methods and assumptions were used to
estimate the fair value of each class of securities for which it is practicable to estimate the value:  1. Cash and Cash Equivalents  The carrying amounts of $125 million and $165 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively, approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these securities.
2. Indebtedness Excluding Notes Payable
The fair values of long-term indebtedness are based upon the quoted market
prices of similar issues. Carrying amounts and fair values as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 were as follows:  2004

Note N. Segment and Related
Information  For the purpose of providing segment information,
NSTARs principal operating segments, or its traditional core businesses, are the electric and natural gas utilities that provide energy delivery services in 107 cities and towns in Massachusetts.  The unregulated operating segment engages in business activities that include district energy
operations, telecommunications and liquefied natural gas service. Amounts shown on the following table for 2004, 2003 and 2002 include the allocation of NSTARs parent company results of operations and assets, net of inter-company
transactions, and primarily consist of interest charges and investment assets, respectively, to these business segments. The allocation of parent company charges is based on an indirect allocation of the parent companys investment relating to
these various business segments. 
71 Table of Contents
The unregulated net income for 2004 as compared to 2003 reflects the absence of operations in 2004 at Blackstone Station
due to its sale in 2003 and the resulting impact of decreased income on NSTAR Steam Corporation, offset by a higher gross margin at Advanced Energy Systems Inc. resulting from increased steam sales and higher demand revenues. The unregulated net
income for 2003 reflects an increase in NSTARs wholesale telecommunications business and the sale of Blackstone Station that generated a $26 million gain. Offsetting these increases in unregulated income were decreases at Advanced Energy
Systems primarily due to fuel price increases. On December 24, 2003, NSTAR abandoned the 116 million shares of RCN common stock and recorded a pre-tax charge of $68 million including expenses. Offsetting the 2003 RCN abandonment loss is the
recognition of $68 million of tax benefits resulting from unanticipated capital gain transactions.  In addition, the unregulated net loss for 2002 reflects reductions in the carrying value of NSTARs investment and its ultimate discontinuance of its Northwind chilled water operations in the amount of $1
million. Effective September 30, 2002, certain chilled water operations were terminated in accordance with its contractual obligations. The net loss for 2002 for the unregulated operations segment also includes the impact of non-cash, after-tax
charges of $177 million or $033 per share, related to the write-down of NSTARs investment in RCN.  Excluding the impact of transactions related to NSTARs investment in RCN, NSTARs chilled water operations and the negative effect of the allocation of parent company losses, the unregulated operations
segment would otherwise reflect a minimal level of net income for 2002.  The
unregulated net expenditures for property decreased as compared to 2003 primarily due to the absence in 2004 of expenditures for MATEPs expansion project that was placed into service in late 2003.

Note O. Contracts for the Purchase of Energy  1. NSTAR Electric Purchase Power Agreements  In accordance with the 1997 Massachusetts Electric Restructuring Act the Act, NSTAR divested of its generation facilities and replaced
that load requirement through purchase power contracts, both with existing contracts and with newly executed contracts. As a result, NSTAR has been required to enter into purchase power contracts of varying lengths to satisfy its electric load
requirements. NSTAR has limitations, as mandated by the MDTE, as to the length of these contracts. As Massachusetts distribution companies, NSTAR Electric is required to obtain and resell power to retail customers through either default or standard
offer service for those who choose not to buy energy from a competitive energy supplier. Default service is provided to customers who have entered NSTARs service territory after the effective date of the Act and whose rate is intended to
reflect current market conditions. Standard offer service is provided to customers who were customers at the time of the Act and whose rate is determined by the MDTE to guarantee overall rate reductions. Standard offer service will expire on
February 28, 2005. NSTAR has entered into agreements ranging in length from three to twelve months for its default service power supply. For its standard offer service power supply, NSTAR assigned its existing long-term contracts to meet this load
requirement.  To a certain extent, NSTAR supplements its load requirements
through existing long-term contracts. NSTAR Electric, during 2003 and 2004, initiated a process to auction off certain purchase power agreements under which it had entitlements to under long-term contracts. One contract in which NSTAR Electric had
entitlements to approximately 300 MW of the 1,100 MW of capacity, originally included in the auction, expired on December 31, 2004. Also in 2004, NSTAR Electric executed agreements to buy-out or restructure twelve of its purchase power agreements.
These buy-out/restructuring agreements provide no economic benefit to NSTAR Electric and, therefore, the agreements contract termination costs will be recorded on the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. These agreements constitute
approximately 685 MW of the 1,100 MW of capacity, originally included in the auction, and reduce the amount of above-market costs that NSTAR Electric will collect from its customers through its transition charges. As of December 31, 2004, four of
these agreements have received MDTE approval and were recognized. Two of the four agreements require NSTAR Electric to make monthly payments through December 2008 totaling approximately $80 million. The other two agreements require NSTAR Electric to
make monthly payments through September 2011 totaling approximately $125 million.  On January 7, 2005, NSTAR Electric received approval from the MDTE for an additional four agreements that are anticipated to be completed by February 2005. These four agreements were binding as of December 31, 2004 but were contingent upon
regulatory approval. Since the contingency was removed during February 2005, NSTAR recorded the contract termination cost as of December 31, 2004. One of the four agreements requires NSTAR Electric to make net monthly payments through September 2011
totaling approximately $416 million. The other three agreements require NSTAR Electric to make net monthly payments through September 2016 totaling approximately $490 million. NSTAR Electric anticipates making these cash payments from funds
generated from operations and will be fully recovered through NSTAR Electrics transition charge.  The total amount currently recognized for obligations relating to eight of the twelve contracts is approximately $852 million in present day dollars; approximately $171 million as a component of current liabilities
- - power contracts and $681 million as a component of Deferred credits - power contracts on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. NSTAR Electric has recorded a corresponding regulatory asset to reflect the full future recovery of these
payments through its transition charge. This recognition represents a non-cash increase to assets and liabilities.  Also in January 2005, the MDTE approved the remaining four contracts with two suppliers that reduced the overall amount of transition costs to be paid for above-market
contracts. These contracts are buy-out arrangements whereby NSTAR Electric has committed to pay amounts for the full release of its obligation under previous purchase power agreements. On August 31, 2004, NSTAR Electric filed with the MDTE a
proposed 
74 Table of Contents
financing plan that seeks approval for full recovery of these buy-out costs and the issuance of $6745 million of transition property securitization bonds to
provide the funds for these buy-out agreements. The MDTE approved the financing plan in January 2005. On February 15, 2005, the bonds were priced at a weighted average yield of 415%. NSTAR expects the securitization financing to close in March
2005.  Capacity Costs  Capacity costs of long-term contracts reflect NSTAR Electrics proportionate share of
capital and fixed operating costs of certain generating units. In 2004, these costs were attributed to 5297 MW of capacity purchased. Energy costs are paid to generators based on a price per kWh actually received into NSTAR Electrics
distribution system and are included in the total cost. Total capacity purchased in 2004 was 1,2014 MW.  Information related to long-term power contracts during 2004 was as follows:   thousands

Years thereafter 23,164 60,546  As of December 31, 2004, NSTAR
Electric had executed agreements to divest a number of its purchase power agreements and expects additional divestitures to be executed in 2005. The remaining long-term purchase power agreements are primarily energy only, however, some agreements
have minor capacity cost obligations.  2.
NSTAR Gas Firm Transportation and Storage Agreements  NSTAR Gas purchases
transportation, storage and balancing services from Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company and Algonquin Gas Transmission Company, as well as other upstream pipelines that bring gas from major producing regions in the U.S., Gulf of Mexico and Canada to the
final delivery points in the NSTAR Gas service area. NSTAR Gas also utilizes contracts for underground storage facilities to meet its winter peaking demands. 
75 Table of Contents
The underground storage contracts are a combination of existing and new agreements that are the result of FERC Order 636 service unbundling. During the
summer injection season, excess pipeline capacity is used to deliver and store gas in market area storage facilities, located in the New York and Pennsylvania region. Stored gas is withdrawn during the winter season to supplement pipeline supplies
in order to meet firm heating demand. NSTAR Gas has firm storage capacity entitlements of nearly 80 billion cubic feet.  NSTAR Gas has various contractual agreements covering the transportation of natural gas and underground natural gas storage facilities, which are recoverable from
customers under the MDTE-approved Cost of Gas Adjustment Clause. These contracts expire at various times from 2006 to 2014. NSTAR Gas firm contract demand charges associated with firm pipeline transportation and storage capacity contracts in
2004, 2003 and 2002 were approximately $484 million, $505 million and $518 million and, respectively. NSTAR Gas firm contract demand charges at current rates under these contracts for the years after 2004 are as follows:  in thousands

Sale of Property  On April 7, 2004, Boston Edison completed the sale of a parcel of land in the City of
Newton, Massachusetts for $151 million; the net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce Boston Edisons transition charge. The sale and the regulatory treatment of the proceeds were approved by the MDTE.  Service Quality Indicators  Service quality indicators are established performance benchmarks for certain identified
measures of service quality relating to customer service and billing performance, customer satisfaction, and reliability and safety performance for all Massachusetts utilities. NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas are required to report annually to the MDTE
concerning their performance as to each measure and are subject to maximum penalties of up to two percent of transmission and distribution revenues should performance fail to meet the applicable benchmarks.  On March 1, 2004, NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas filed their 2003 Service Quality Reports with
the MDTE that demonstrated the Companies achieved levels of reliability and performance; the reports indicate that no penalty was assessable for 2003. The MDTE concurred with NSTARs determination in an order issued in October 2004. NSTAR
monitors its service quality continuously to determine its contingent liability, and if its probable that a liability has been incurred and is estimable, and liability would be accrued. Annually, each NSTAR utility subsidiary makes a service
quality performance filing with the MDTE. Any settlement or rate order that would result in a different liability level from what has been accrued would be adjusted in the period that the MDTE issues an order determining the amount of any such
liability. Recently, the MDTE voted to initiate an investigation into potentially modifying the service quality indicators for all Massachusetts utilities. Until any such order is issued, the current service quality indicators will remain in place.
As of December 31, 2004, NSTAR Electrics and NSTAR Gas 2004
performance has exceeded the applicable established benchmarks and, as such, that no liability has been accrued for 2004.

Generating Assets Divestiture  On April 8, 2003, Cambridge Electric completed the sale of Blackstone Station to Harvard University Harvard for $146 million. The net
proceeds $104 million from the sale were used to reduce Cambridge Electrics transition charge. The sale by Cambridge Electric was approved by the MDTE on March 14, 2003. Also on April8, 2003, NSTAR Steam Corporation completed the sale
of its Blackstone Station steam assets to Harvard for $3 million. The net impact of these transactions resulted in a pretax gain of $13 million. Under terms of an operating agreement, NSTAR Steam continued to manage the day-to-day operations of the
steam plant on this site until April 8, 2004.  Note Q. Commitments and
Contingencies  1. Contractual Commitments
NSTAR also has leases for facilities and equipment. The estimated minimum
rental commitments under non-cancellable capital and operating leases for the years after 2004 are as follows:  in thousands 2005 20,471
2006 14,331
2007 12,457
2008 10,753
2009 9,461
Years thereafter 38,609 106,082  The total expense for both lease and
transmission agreements was $965 million in 2004, $882 million in 2003 and $866 million in 2002, net of capitalized expenses of $15 million in 2004, $19 million in 2003 and $23 million in 2002.  Total rent expense for all operating leases, except those with terms of a month or less,
amounted to $163 million in 2004, $199 million in 2003 and $91 million in 2002.  NSTAR Electric has entered into a short-term power purchase agreement to meet its entire default service supply obligation, other than to large customers, for the period January 1, 2005 through June 30, 2005 and for 50% of its obligation,
other than to large customers, for the second-half of 2005. NSTAR Electric has entered into a short-term power purchase agreement to meet its entire default service supply obligation for large customers through March 2005. A Request for Proposals
will be issued quarterly in 2005 for the remainder of the obligation for large customers and semi-annually for non-large customers in accordance with MDTE requirements. NSTAR Electric entered into agreements ranging in length from three to
twelve-months effective January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2004 with suppliers to provide full default service energy and ancillary service requirements at contract rates approved by the MDTE. NSTAR Electric is currently recovering payments it is
making to suppliers from its customers and has financial and performance assurances and financial guarantees in place with those suppliers to protect NSTAR Electric from risk in the unlikely event any of its suppliers encounter financial
difficulties or fail to maintain an investment grade credit rating. In connection with certain of these agreements, should, in the unlikely event, an individual NSTAR Electric distribution company receive a credit rating below investment grade, that
company potentially could be required to obtain certain financial commitments, including but not limited to, letters of credit. Refer to Note O, Contracts for the Purchase of Energy for a further discussion.  In the first quarter of 2005, NSTAR expects to begin construction on a 345kV transmission
line that would connect Stoughton, Massachusetts, a southern suburb of Boston, to South Boston. This transmission line is expected to assure continued reliability of electric service and improve power import capacity in the Northeast 
77 Table of Contents
Massachusetts area. This project is expected to be placed in service during the summer of 2006. The cost of the project is expected to be shared by all of
New England and will be recovered by NSTAR through wholesale and retail transmission rates. As of December 31, 2004, NSTAR has contractual commitments of approximately $6 million related to this project.  2. Electric Equity Investments and Joint Ownership Interest
NSTAR has an equity investment of approximately 145% in two companies that
own and operate transmission facilities to import electricity from the Hydro-Quebec system in Canada. As an equity participant, NSTAR is required to guarantee, in addition to each companies own share, the obligations of those participants who
do not meet certain credit criteria. At December 31, 2004, NSTARs portion of these guarantees amounted to $95 million. New England Hydro-Transmission Electric Company, Inc. NEH and New England Hydro-Transmission Corporation NHH have
agreed to use their best efforts to limit their equity investment to 40% of their total capital during the time NEH and NHH have outstanding debt in their capital structure. In order to meet their best efforts obligations pursuant to the Equity
Funding Agreement dated June 1, 1985, as amended, for NEH and NHH, in 2004, NEH repurchased a total of 275,000 of its outstanding shares from all equity holders and NHH repurchased a total of 1,500 outstanding shares from all equity holders. Through
December 31, 2004, NSTAR Electrics reduction of its equity ownership resulting from NEH buy-back of 39,785 shares and NHH buy-back of 217 shares was approximately $1,017,000.  NSTAR Electric collectively has an equity ownership of 14% in Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company CYAPC, 14% in Yankee Atomic Electric
Company YAEC, and 4% in Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company, collectively, the Yankee Companies. Periodically, NSTAR obtains estimates from the management of the Yankee Companies on the cost of decommissioning the Connecticut Yankee
nuclear unit CY, the Yankee Atomic nuclear unit YA, and the Maine Yankee nuclear unit MY. These nuclear units are completely shut down and are currently conducting decommissioning activities.  Based on estimates from the Yankee Companies management as of December 31, 2004, the
total remaining cost for decommissioning each nuclear unit is approximately as follows: $630 million for CY, $119 million for YA and $292 million for MY. Of these amounts, NSTAR Electric is obligated to pay $882 million towards the decommissioning
of CY, $167 million toward YA, and $117 million toward MY. These estimates are recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as Power contract liabilities with a corresponding regulatory asset and do not impact the current results of
operations and cash flows. These estimates may be revised from time to time based on information available to the Yankee Companies regarding future costs. The Yankee Companies have received approval from FERC for recovery of these costs and NSTAR
expects any additional increases to these costs to be included in future rate applications with the FERC, with any resulting adjustments being charged to their respective sponsors, including NSTAR Electric. NSTAR Electric would recover its share of
any allowed increases from customers through the transition charge.  The
various decommissioning trusts for which NSTAR or it subsidiaries are responsible through their equity ownership are established pursuant to Federal regulations. The investment of decommissioning funds that have been established, are managed in
accordance with these federal guidelines, state jurisdictions and with the applicable Internal Revenue Service requirements. Some of the requirements state that these investments be managed independently by a prudent fund manager and that funds are
to be invested in conservative, minimum risk investment securities. Any gains or losses are anticipated to be refunded to or collected from customers, respectively.  CYs estimated decommissioning costs increased significantly in 2003 and the increase reflects the fact that CY is now self-performing
all work to complete the decommissioning of the plant due to the termination of the decommissioning contract with Bechtel Power Corporation Bechtel. In July 2004, CY filed with FERC for recovery of these increased costs. In August 2004, FERC
issued an order accepting the new rates, beginning in February 2005, subject to refund. 
78 Table of Contents
CY is currently in litigation with Bechtel over the termination of its decommissioning contract. Additionally, Bechtel
filed a complaint against CY asserting several claims as well as wrongful termination. Bechtel sought to garnish the decommissioning trust and related payments. In October 2004, Bechtel and CY entered into a stipulation under which Bechtel
relinquished its right to seek garnishment of the decommissioning trust and related payments in return for the potential attachment of CYs real property in Connecticut with a book value of $79 million and the escrowing of portions of the
sponsors periodic payments, up to a total of $417 million, all of which the sponsors, which include NSTAR Electric, are scheduled to pay to CY through June 30, 2007. This stipulation is subject to approval of the Court and would not be
implemented until the Court found that such assets were subject to attachment. CY intends to contest the ability of Bechtel to attach these assets. Discovery is underway and a trial has been scheduled for May 2006.  3. Financial and Performance Guarantees  On a limited basis, NSTAR and certain of its subsidiaries may enter into agreements
providing financial assurance to third parties. Such agreements include letters of credit, surety bonds, and other guarantees.  At December 31, 2004, outstanding guarantees totaled $303 million as follows:  in thousands Letters of Credit 5,560
Surety Bonds 15,281
Other Guarantees 9,500 Total Guarantees 30,341  The $56 million letter of credit is
for the benefit of a third party, as trustee in connection with the 6924% Notes of one of NSTARs subsidiaries. The letter of credit is available if the subsidiary has insufficient funds to pay the debt service requirements. As of December 31,
2004, there have been no amounts drawn under this letter of credit.  As of
December 31, 2004, certain of NSTARs subsidiaries have purchased a total of $06 million of performance surety bonds for the purpose of obtaining licenses, permits and rights-of-way in various municipalities. In addition, NSTAR and certain of
its subsidiaries have purchased approximately $147 million in workers compensation self-insurer bonds. These bonds support the guarantee by NSTAR and certain of its subsidiaries to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts required as part of the
Companys workers compensation self-insurance program.  NSTAR and
its subsidiaries have also issued $95 million of residual value guarantees related to its equity interest in the Hydro-Quebec transmission companies.  Management believes the likelihood NSTAR would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote.
4. Environmental Matters  As of December 31, 2004, NSTARs subsidiaries are involved in four state regulated
properties Massachusetts Contingency Plan, or MCP sites where oil or other hazardous materials were previously spilled or released. The NSTAR subsidiaries are required to clean up or otherwise remediate these properties in
accordance with specific state regulations. There are sometimes uncertainties associated with total remediation costs due to the final selection of the specific cleanup technology and the particular characteristics of the different sites. Estimates
of approximately $05 million and $07 million are included as liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 
79 Table of Contents
In addition to the MCP sites, NSTAR subsidiaries also face possible liability as a result of involvement in 15
multi-party disposal sites or third party claims associated with contamination remediation. NSTAR generally expects to have only a small percentage of the total potential liability for these sites. Estimates of approximately $34 million are
included as liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2004 and 2003.  The MCP and multi-party disposal site amounts have not been reduced by any potential rate recovery treatment of these costs or any potential recovery from NSTARs insurance carriers. Prospectively, should NSTAR
be allowed to collect these specific costs from customers, it would record an offsetting regulatory asset and record a credit to operating expenses equal to previously expensed costs.  NSTAR Gas is participating in the assessment or remediation of five former manufactured gas plant MGP sites and alleged MGP waste disposal
locations to determine if and to what extent such sites have been contaminated and whether NSTAR Gas may be responsible for remedial action. The MDTE has approved recovery of costs associated with MGP sites over a 7-year period, without carrying
costs. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, NSTAR has recorded a liability of approximately $38 million and $44 million, respectively, as an estimate for site cleanup costs for several MGP sites for which NSTAR Gas was previously cited as a
potentially responsible party. A corresponding regulatory asset has been recorded that reflects the future rate recovery for these costs.  Estimates related to environmental remediation costs are reviewed and adjusted periodically as further investigation and assignment of responsibility occurs and as either
additional sites are identified or NSTARs responsibilities for such sites evolve or are resolved. NSTARs ultimate liability for future environmental remediation costs may vary from these estimates. Based on NSTARs current
assessment of its environmental responsibilities, existing legal requirements and regulatory policies, NSTAR does not believe that these environmental remediation costs will have a material adverse effect on NSTARs consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows for a reporting period.  5. Income Tax Matters  As a result of the RCN
share abandonment in 2003, the Company claimed an ordinary loss on its 2003 tax return for this item. The ordinary loss tax treatment results in the Company realizing the benefits represented by the tax asset recorded on its books that resulted from
the previous write-down of this asset for financial reporting purposes. The requirement for a tax valuation allowance, therefore, no longer exists. The Company has reversed this reserve as of December 31, 2003.  The Company believes it more likely than not that it is entitled to an ordinary loss
deduction. The Company expects the IRS to review this transaction and it is reasonably possible that the IRS will disagree. In accordance with the Companys tax policy as it relates to uncertain tax positions, the Company has established a loss
contingency reserve of approximately $44 million at December 31, 2003. This amount represents the tax impact to the Company should the ordinary loss ultimately be recharacterized to a capital loss. This reserve is recorded as part of Deferred
credits - other on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  If the
Companys position is not upheld, the Company may be required to make future cash expenditures that may impact NSTARs consolidated results of operations and cash flows in a future period.  6. Regulatory and Legal Proceedings  a. Regulatory proceedings  On December 21, 2004, the FERC issued an order approving Boston Edisons October 2004
request for Boston Edison to modify its Open Access Transmission Tariff. Effective January 1, 2005, Boston Edison is allowed to include 50 percent of construction work in progress in its rate base for transmission projects by including this 
80 Table of Contents
amount in its local network service transmission rate formula, rather than capitalizing Allowance for Funds Used During Construction AFUDC charges on the
entire construction expense balance. The order is subject to Boston Edison filing annual reports of its long-term transmission plan.  In December 2004, NSTAR Electric filed proposed transition rate adjustments for 2005, including a preliminary reconciliation of transition, transmission, standard offer
and default service costs and revenues through 2004. The MDTE subsequently approved tariffs for each retail electric subsidiary effective January 1, 2005. The filings are to be updated in February 2005 to reflect final 2004 costs and revenues which
are subject to final reconciliation.  On February 1, 2005, ISO-NE began
operating as an RTO. As a result, NSTAR has given notice to the RTO and other interested parties of its intent to file for proposed changes to its OATT. This change is expected to provide for consistent application of the OATT among all NSTAR
Electric companies. The 2004 OATT and the related revenue have been based on this proposed change. If successful, NSTAR Electric expects to include the impact in its 2005 billing rates.  Effective January 1, 2005, NSTAR Electrics Standard Offer Service Fuel Adjustment SOSFA rates for each of Boston Edison, ComElectric
and Cambridge were modified to a level of 1564 cents per kilowatt-hour with the approval of the MDTE.  Effective October 1, 2004, Boston Edisons SOSFA rate was modified to 1223 cents per kilowatt-hour from zero upon approval by the MDTE. The MDTE has allowed companies to adjust prices to reduce deferred cost
balances that arise due to rapidly changing market costs for the oil and natural gas used to generate electricity and the SOSFA is designed to collect the costs of fuel that companies incur for purchasing electricity from their suppliers to serve
their standard offer service customers. Effective September 1, 2003, the Boston Edison SOSFA was reduced to zero while the ComElectric and Cambridge Electric SOSFAs were increased to 1424 cents per kilowatt-hour until January 1, 2004 when they were
reduced to 1223 cents per kilowatt-hour. These changes followed an increase in this rate adjustment from zero to 0902 cents per kilowatt-hour that was effective May 1, 2003 for all three NSTAR Electric companies. The SOSFA was at zero from April
1, 2002 through April 30, 2003 for all three NSTAR Electric companies. The MDTE has ruled that these fuel index adjustments are excluded from the 15% rate reduction requirement under the Restructuring Act.  In December 2003, NSTAR Electric filed proposed transition rate adjustments for 2004,
including a preliminary reconciliation of transition, transmission, standard offer and default service costs and revenues through 2003. The MDTE subsequently approved tariffs for each retail electric subsidiary effective January 1, 2004. The filings
were updated in February 2004 to include final costs and revenues for 2003.  On
December 1, 2003, NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas filed their annual reconciliation report on their pension and PBOP rate adjustment mechanism. Hearings were held during 2004. NSTAR anticipates an order to the first quarter of 2005. NSTAR cannot
predict the overall timing and result of this order on its financial position or results of operations.  b. Other Legal Matters  In the normal course of its business, NSTAR and its subsidiaries are involved in certain legal matters, including civil litigations. Management is unable to fully
determine a range of reasonably possible court-ordered damages, settlement amounts, and related litigation costs legal liabilities that would be in excess of amounts accrued and amounts covered by insurance. Based on the information
currently available, NSTAR does not believe that it is probable that any such legal liabilities will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position. However, it is reasonably possible that additional legal liabilities that may result
from changes in circumstances could have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for a reporting period.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  To Shareholders and Trustees of NSTAR:  We have completed an integrated audit of NSTARs 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004
and audits of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.  Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under
a1 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of NSTAR and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under a2 present fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Companys management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  Internal control
over financial reporting  Also, in our opinion, managements
assessment, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion,
the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on managements
assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit
of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  /s/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 18,
