Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data. Independent Auditors Report
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Datalink Corporation We have audited the
accompanying balance sheet of Datalink Corporation as of December 31, 2002, and
the related statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for
the year then ended. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audit. The financial statements
of Datalink Corporation as of December 31, 2001, and for the year then ended
were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. Those auditors
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements in their report
dated February 8, 2002. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the 2002 financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Datalink
Corporation. as of December 31, 2002, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. As discussed above, the 2001 financial statements of Datalink
Corporation as listed in the accompanying index were audited by other auditors
who have ceased operations. As described in note 2, these financial statements
have been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets, which was adopted by the Company as of
January 1, 2002. In our opinion, the disclosures for 2001 in note 2 are
appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any
procedures to the 2001 financial statements of Datalink Corporation, other than
with respect to such disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion
or any other form of assurance on the 2001 financial statements taken as a
whole.

This is a copy of an accountants
report previously issued by Arthur Andersen LLP Andersen. This report has not been reissued by
Andersen. After a reasonable effort, we
have been unable to obtain the consent of Andersen for the incorporation by
reference of the report dated February 8, 2002 included in our Annual Report on
Form10-K for the year ended December31, 2002. The financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2001 has been revised to include the
transistional disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which was adopted by
the Company as of January 1, 2002.
Under these circumstances Rule 437a under the Securities Act of 1933
permits us to file a Registration Statement without a written consent from
Andersen. We are not able to obtain the
written consent of Andersen to incorporate by reference this report into our
previously filed registration statements on Form S-8, File number 333-93229 and
Form S-3, File number 333-96901. In
addition, we will not be able to obtain the written consent of Andersen for any
future registration statement we may file as required by Section 7 of the
Securities Act. Accordingly, investors
will not be able to sue Andersen pursuant to Section 11 of the Securities Act
relating to those registration statements and therefore may have their recovery
limited as a result of the lack of consent.
The ability of investors to recover from Andersen may also be limited as
a result of their financial condition or other matters relating to the various
civil and criminal lawsuits relating to them. 23 Report of Independent Public Accountants To

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Description of Business Datalink Corporation the
Company is an independent architect of enterprise-class information storage
infrastructures. The Company derives its revenues principally from designing
and installing data storage systems. The Companys solutions can include
hardware products, such as disk arrays, tape systems and interconnection
components, and storage management software products. The Company is frequently
engaged to provide assistance in the installation of solutions and to provide
support services subsequent to the installation. Occasionally, the Company is
engaged for consulting services. The Company views its operations
and manages its business as one segment, the design and installation of
enterprise-class information storage solutions. Factors used to identify the
Companys single operating segment include the organizational structure of the
Company and the financial information available for evaluation by the chief
operating decision maker in making decisions about how to allocate resources
and assess performance. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, net sales to one customer
totaled 5%, 9% and 15% of total net sales, respectively. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist
principally of money market funds with original maturities of three months or
less, are readily convertible to cash and are stated at cost, which
approximates fair value. Accounts Receivable, net Accounts receivable are recorded
net of the reserve for doubtful accounts of $197,000 and $164,000 at December
31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Inventories Inventories, including
inventories shipped but not installed, principally consist of data storage
products and components, that are valued at the lower of cost or market with
cost determined on a first-in, first-out FIFO method. Property and Equipment Property and equipment, including
purchased software, are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are
provided by charges to operations using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 2 to 10 years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their
estimated useful lives or the underlying lease term. The costs and related
accumulated depreciation and amortization on asset disposals are removed from
the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations. Major renewals and
betterments are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged to
current operations when incurred.

During 2000, the Company began
the implementation of a new customer relationship management CRM application
suite. The Company capitalized costs of the implementation of $801,000 in 2002 10 million in 2001 and $624,000 in 2000. 29 Amounts
are being amortized over a period of 3 years from the date they are available
for use. Amortization of software costs
was $922,000 in 2002, $139,000 in 2001 and $0 in 2000. Goodwill On January 1, 2002, new
accounting rules for business combinations and accounting for goodwill and
other intangibles SFAS 141 and 142 became effective for the Company. The Company adopted SFAS 142 on January 1,
2002 and accordingly evaluated its existing intangible assets and goodwill that
were acquired in prior business combinations and determined there was no
impairment upon adoption. Goodwill is no longer being amortized against
earnings and goodwill balances are subject to an impairment review on an annual
basis or sooner if indicators of potential impairment exist. In addition, the new rules further defined
the classes of intangible assets which caused the Company to reclassify the
$652,000 unamortized balance of an intangible asset represented by the
estimated value of assembled workforce to goodwill as of January 1, 2002. The value of assembled workforce at December
31, 2001 was also reclassified in these financial statements for comparative
purposes. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income loss and
income loss per share adjusted for the exclusion of goodwill, net of tax

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically at
least annually analyzes its long-lived assets for potential impairment,
assessing the appropriateness of lives and recoverability of unamortized
balances through measurement of undiscounted operating cash flows on a basis consistent
with generally accepted accounting principles. Income Taxes The Company calculates income
taxes in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes, which requires the use of the liability method of accounting for income
taxes. Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are recorded to
reflect the tax consequences in future years of temporary differences between
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts
using enacted tax rates for the years in which these items are expected to
affect taxable income. The Company establishes valuation allowances when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Company expects are
more likely than not to realize. Income tax expense is the tax payable for the
period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition In December 1999,
the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No101, Revenue
Recognition, which clarified the SEC staffs views regarding the recognition
and reporting of revenues in certain transactions. In consideration of the
views expressed in SAB No101 and effective as of January1, 2000,
the Company modified its revenue recognition policy related to products when
the Company provides any installation or configuration services in connection
with the sale. The Company now recognizes revenue from hardware and software
product sales when it completes its installation and configuration services
that are essential to the functionality of the delivered hardware and software
products or after the customer has accepted products under evaluation. For any
remaining installation that is not essential to the functionality of delivered
product, the Company accounts for the remaining installation as a separate unit
of accounting and defers revenue based on objective fair value for such
services. Under the transition provisions outlined in SAB No101, the
Company accounted for this change in accounting policy prospectively as of
January1, 2000 and recorded a charge to earnings on that date of $753,000
representing the cumulative effect, net of income taxes, of the change in
accounting policy. Prior to January1, 2000, the Company recognized
product revenue when the hardware and software was shipped to its customers or
after they accepted products under evaluation. The Company
recognizes installation and consulting service revenue as it renders these
services. The Company also sells service contracts to most of its customers.
These contracts are support service agreements. The Company has an
internal support desk to provide integrated customer support services.
The Company fulfills on-site assistance by purchasing support service
agreements for customers from the hardware and software vendors or their
designated third-party service providers and by arranging on-site support
assistance with the appropriate vendor when necessary. Revenues and direct
costs resulting from these contracts are deferred and amortized into operations
over the term of the contracts, which are generally twelve months. The
Company is contractually obligated to provide or arrange to provide these
underlying support services to its customers in the unlikely event that the
hardware or software vendor, or its designee, fails to perform according to the
terms of its contract. 31 Offering Costs On March 7, 2000, the
Company filed a registration statement with the SEC for a second public
offering of 2,500,000 shares of its common stock. On May 15, 2000, the Company
withdrew this registration statement due to market conditions. As required, the
Company expensed the previously deferred costs of $381,000 related to the
offering. Net Income Loss Per Share Basic net income loss per share
is computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted
net income per share includes the effect of common stock equivalents, if any,
for each period. The number of additional shares is calculated by assuming that
outstanding stock options were exercised and that the proceeds from such
exercise were used to acquire shares of common stock at the average market
price during the reporting period. The
impact of stock options have been included in the computation of diluted income
per share, increasing the weighted average number of shares outstanding by
371,880 shares in 2000. Due to the net loss in 2001 and 2002, common stock
equivalents of 62,564 and 62,536, respectively would have been anti-dilutive to
losses and as a result were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per
share. Comprehensive Income The Companys comprehensive
income is equal to its net income for all periods presented. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued SFAS No. 146 Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities. SFAS No. 146 supersedes EITF No. 94-3. The principle difference
between SFAS No. 146 and EITF No. 94-3 relates to when an entity can recognize
a liability related to exit or disposal activities. SFAS No. 146 requires a
liability be recognized for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity
when the liability is incurred. EITF No. 94-3 allowed a liability, related to
an exit or disposal activity, to be recognized at the date an entity commits to
an exit plan. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 are effective on January 1, 2003.
Accordingly, the Company will apply this standard to all exit or disposal
activities initiated after December 31, 2002. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Stock
Compensation. SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a
voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements
of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim
financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company
does not plan to change its method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. The Company will make the required interim disclosures effective
with the quarter ending March 31, 2003. In December 2002, the EITF issued EITF 00 21, Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. This Issue addresses certain aspects
of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform
multiple revenue-generating activities.
In some arrangements, the different revenue-generating activities
deliverables are sufficiently separable, and there exists sufficient evidence
of their fair values to separately account for some or all of the deliverables
that is, there are separate units of accounting. In other arrangements, some or all of the deliverables are not
independently functional, or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair
values to account for them separately. This Issue addresses when and, if so,
how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into
separate units of accounting. This
Issue does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria. This
Issue is applicable for the Company for fiscal 2004 and could have an impact on
revenue recognition of future sales transactions. Reclassifications Certain 2001 amounts have been
reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 32 3. Borrowing Arrangements Effective June 30, 2002, the Company entered into a revolving credit
agreement the Credit Agreement with a bank. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company may borrow
up to $8 million to be used for financing working capital needs. The term of the agreement ends June 30,
2003. Borrowings under the Credit
Agreement are collateralized by the accounts receivable and inventory of the
Company. The Credit Agreement includes various covenants, including
requirements to maintain a maximum level of debt-cash flow ratio and a minimum
amount of working capital, tangible net worth and debt-net worth ratio. At December 31, 2002, the Company was in
compliance with the covenants in the Credit Agreement. The Company had no outstanding borrowings
under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2002. Effective February28, 1999,
the Company redeemed 1,095,720 shares of common stock held by a former
stockholder. The Company issued a $3
million note payable to this former stockholder. The note provided for interest
on the outstanding balance at the prime rate beginning August28, 1999. A
principal payment of $906,000 was made on August 28, 1999. Two principal payments of $705,000 each were
made on February 28, 2000 and 2001 with the remaining principal balance of
$704,000 was paid on February28, 2002. As of December31, 2002 and
2001, the Company was the owner and beneficiary of a term life insurance policy
with a face value of $0 million and $704,000, respectively insuring the life of
this stockholder. 4. Income Taxes The provision for benefit from

The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2002 and 2001
was $1,609 and $0, respectively. The
net change in the total valuation allowance for the years ended December 31,
2002 and 2001 was an increase of $1,609 and $0, respectively. In assessing the recoverability
of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The
ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon carry back to
prior periods and upon the generation of future taxable income during the
periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management
considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, carry back
potential and projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in
making this assessment. Based upon the
level of taxable losses in recent years and uncertainty of future taxable
income, management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company
will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences at December 31,
2002. At December 31, 2002, the Company
had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $5,037 which are
available to offset future state taxable income. If not used, these net operating loss carryforwards will expire
between 2012 and 2021. Subsequently recognized tax benefits relating to the $1,609 valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2002 would be reported in
the statement of operations as an income tax benefit of $1,609. 5. Lease Commitments The Company has 21 office
locations throughout the United States.
Some of these locations are leased facilities under non-cancelable
operating lease agreements. In August 2000, the Company
purchased the land adjacent to its new corporate headquarters for
$384,000. At December 31, 2000, the
construction in progress of $20 million represents payments made by the
developer for the construction of the Companys new corporate
headquarters. A corresponding
obligation for construction in progress of $20 million was recorded as a
liability as of December 31, 2000. Upon
completion of the building and commencement of the lease term in June 2001, the
asset and related obligation were removed from the Companys balance sheet in
accordance with accounting for the building as an operating lease. The building functions as the Companys
corporate headquarters including the principal technical operations and the
integration, assembly and support service operations. It is located in a 104,000 square foot office and warehouse
facility in Chanhassen, Minnesota. The Companys remaining 20
locations including sales and technical staff are small to medium sized
offices. Regional hubs are located
within each of the Companys regions in the Northeast, Southeast, Central and
West. 34 As
of December31, 2002, future minimum lease payments due under non-cancelable
operating leases are as follows

6. Employee Benefit Plan The Company has a defined
contribution retirement plan for eligible employees. Employees may contribute
up to 15% of their pretax compensation to the 401k portion of the plan. The
Company is required to match 50% of an employees contribution up to the first
6% of an employees eligible compensation. The cost of the Companys
contributions to the 401k portion of the plan for 2002, 2001 and 2000,
was $356,000, $428,000 and $349,000,
respectively. 7. Stockholders Equity Private Placement In May 2002, the Company sold an aggregate of
1,180,000 shares of Common Stock, plus five-year warrants to purchase an
additional 200,000 shares at an exercise price of $450 per share, to five
institutional investors for $53 million.
The Company allocated
an amount to the value of the warrants utilizing a fair value estimate derived
from the Black Scholes option pricing model assuming a volatility of 102%, the
warrant life of 5 years and a risk-free interest rate of 476%. Based on this
fair value estimate, the Company allocated approximately $863,000 to the
warrants and $4,437,000 to the Common Stock. Based upon representations made by
the purchasers to the Company, the Company relied on Section 42 of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for an exemption from registration of the
issuance of these securities. Stock Compensation Plans Effective May 8, 2001, the
Company reserved an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance
pursuant to the Companys Incentive Compensation Plan the Incentive Plan,
1,230,697 of which were available for grant as of December 31, 2002. The terms
of the plan allow for a variety of awards including incentive stock options,
nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards, phantom shares and
other share-based awards as determined by the Companys Compensation
Committee the Committee. The Company has also reserved
250,000 shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to the Companys Employee
Stock Purchase Plan. Under terms of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, eligible
employees may designate up to 15% of their compensation to be withheld through
payroll deductions and will be granted an option to purchase a designated
number of shares of common stock at a purchase price determined by the
Committee, but at no less than 85% of the lower of the market price on the
first or last day of the purchase period. In August 2000, the Board of
Directors adopted the 2000 Director Stock Option Plan the Director Plan. The Company amended the Director Plan in May
and October 2002. The terms of the
Director Plan allow for stock option grants to 35 non-employee
members of the Board of Directors. The
Company has reserved 300,000 shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to
the Director Plan. Stock Options The following table summarizes

In accordance with SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company accounts for stock-based
compensation to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employee, and related interpretations. Accordingly, compensation cost for
stock options granted to employees is measured as the excess, if any, of the
fair value of the Companys common stock at the date of the grant over the
amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. During 2000 and 1999, the Company
issued 135,850 options with an exercise price below the fair market value of
common stock at the date of grant. The
intrinsic value of the options is being recorded to compensation expense over
the vesting period, generally four years.
During 2002 and 2001, $118,000 and $119,000, respectively, of
compensation expense was recorded related to these options. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, there was
$128,000 and $246,000, respectively, of compensation expense related to these
options that will be recognized in future periods. During 2002 and 2001, the
Company issued 47,250 and 49,750 options, respectively, to directors below the
fair market value of common stock at the date of grant. The compensation expense recorded was
$90,000 and $27,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Because the options vest immediately, all compensation expense
was recorded in the period of the grant. Pro forma net income loss and
earnings loss per share have been determined as if the Company had used the
fair value method of accounting for its stock option grants and employee stock
purchase plan share elections consistent with the method of SFAS No. 123. Under this method, compensation expense is
recognized over the applicable vesting periods and is based on the shares under
option and their related fair values on the grant date.

8. OpenSystems.com, Inc. Acquisition On November 10, 2000, the Company acquired certain
assets of the data storage and service business of OpenSystems.com, Inc., a
Walpole, Massachusetts-based firm engaged in the resale and installation of
data storage solutions. Under the terms
of the sale agreement, the Company agreed to pay $7 million in cash and issue
79,177 shares of its common stock for these assets. Additionally, the Company
would have been required to pay $25 million of cash consideration to the
seller if certain revenue targets were met in 2001. Since the revenue targets were not met in 2001, no payment was
made.
The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. The following
unaudited pro forma condensed results of operations have been prepared to give
