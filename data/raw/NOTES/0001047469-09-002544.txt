MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING    
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined
in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of the Company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
The
Company management assessed the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008. In making this assessment, management used
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework. Based on management assessment using the COSO criteria, management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2008. 
The
effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopersLLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein. s/ STEPHANIE G. DIMARCO  Stephanie G. DiMarco

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    
To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Advent Software,Inc.: In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under a1 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Advent
Software,Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2008 and December31, 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
index appearing under a23 presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Company
management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company internal control over financial reporting
based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions. 
As
discussed in Note14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted new fair value measurement and disclosure accounting principles during the year ended
December31, 2008. In addition, as discussed in Note1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for uncertainty in income taxes in
2007. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s/

ADVENT SOFTWARE,INC.      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
Note1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Business description:Advent Software,Inc. Advent or the Company provides stand-alone and client/server software products,
data and
data interfaces and related maintenance and services that automate, integrate and support certain mission-critical functions of the front, middle and back offices of investment management
organizations. Advent clients vary significantly in size and assets under management and include investment advisors, brokerage firms, banks, hedge funds, corporations, public funds, foundations,
universities and non-profit organizations. 
Basis of presentation:The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Advent and its wholly-owned subsidiaries after
elimination of
all intercompany transactions and amounts. We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. 
Year End:Advent fiscal year ends on December31st. 
Foreign currency translation:The functional currencies of the Company foreign subsidiaries are their local currencies. All assets
and liabilities
denominated in foreign functional currencies are translated into US dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues, costs and expenses in foreign functional currencies are translated
at the average rate of exchange during the period. 
Foreign currency measurement:Asset and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional
currencies are re-measured into the functional currency with gains or losses recorded in interest income and other, net on the consolidated statement of operations. 
Use of estimates:The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Advent believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial
statements: Business Combinations; Goodwill; Revenue Recognition; Income Taxes; Restructuring Charges and Related Accruals; Impairment of Long-Lived Assets; Legal Contingencies; Sales
Returns and Accounts Receivable Allowances; and Stock-Based Compensation. Cash and cash equivalents:Cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity
of
90days or less at the date of purchase. 
Marketable securities:All of Advent marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair
value. The unrealized gains and losses, net of any related tax effect, are reported in accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders' equity in the accompanying consolidated financial statements,
with the exception of Advent broker/dealer subsidiary, which reports unrealized gains and losses in interest income and other, net on the consolidated statement of operations. Realized gains and
losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are also included in interest income and other, net. 
Investments:Investments are recorded at cost and reviewed for impairment. Investments are included in other assets on the
consolidated balance
sheets and consist of non-marketable 
77 
Table of Contents ADVENT SOFTWARE,INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued investments
in privately held companies, most of which can be considered in the start-up or development stages. It is Advent policy to review investments in privately held companies on a
regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these companies. This policy
includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each of the companies cash position, financing needs, earnings/revenue outlook, operational performance, management/ownership changes and competition. The
evaluation process is based on information that Advent requests from these privately held companies. This information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as US publicly traded companies,
and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies. 
The
Company investments in privately held companies are assessed for impairment when a review of the investee operations indicate that there exists a decline in value of the
investment and the decline is other than temporary. Such indicators include, but are not limited to, limited capital resources, limited prospects of receiving additional financing, and prospects for
liquidity of the related securities. Impaired investments in privately held companies are written down to estimated fair value. The Company estimates fair value using a variety of valuation
methodologies. Such methodologies include comparing the private company with publicly traded companies in similar lines of business, applying revenue multiples to estimated future operating results
for the private company and estimating discounted cash flows for that company. 
Product development:Product development expenses consist primarily of salary, benefits and stock-based compensation for the Company
development
and technical support staff, contractors' fees and other costs associated with the enhancements of existing products and services and development of new products and services. Costs incurred for
software development prior to technological feasibility are expensed as product development costs in the period incurred. Once the point of technological feasibility is reached, which is generally the
completion of a working prototype that has no critical bugs and is a release candidate, development costs are capitalized until the product is ready for general release and are classified other
intangibles, net on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company amortizes capitalized software development costs using the greater of the ratio of the products' current gross revenues to the total
of current expected gross revenues or on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the related product, which is typically three years. 
Capitalization of internal use software:Certain costs related to computer software developed or obtained for internal use are
capitalized in
accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position No98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal
Use. The Company amortizes internal use software costs over their estimated useful lives, which typically range from two to five years. 
Property and equipment:Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Advent calculates
depreciation and
amortization using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the
shorter of the estimated useful life of the assets or the remaining lease term. The cost and related accumulated depreciation applicable to property and equipment sold or no

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued longer
in service are eliminated from the accounts and any gains or losses are generally included in operating expenses. Useful lives by principal classifications are as follows: Computer equipment and software
3 to 5years Leasehold improvements
End of lease term Furniture and fixtures
3 to 5years Telephone system
3 to 5years Repairs
and maintenance expenditures, which are not considered improvements and do not extend the useful life of the property and equipment, are expensed as incurred. 
Goodwill:Advent reviews goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year as of November1 and more
frequently
if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss has occurred. Advent is required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Advent has determined that its operations
were organized into three reporting units as of November1, 2008. The test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process: The
first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its respective carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying
amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired, thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. 
The
second step, used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of each reporting unit goodwill with the respective carrying amount of that goodwill. If
the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The
process for evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires judgment at many points during the test including future revenue forecasts, discount rates and
various reporting unit allocations. During the fourth quarter of 2008, Advent completed the first step of its annual impairment test which did not indicate impairment. Therefore, the second step of
the impairment test was not necessary to perform. 
Accounting for long-lived assets:Advent also reviews its other long-lived assets including property and equipment and other
intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability
is measured by a comparison of the assets' carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. 
Other
intangible assets mainly represent completed technology, distributor licenses, customer lists, trademark/tradenames and non-compete agreements acquired in business
combinations. Acquired identifiable intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Purchased technology
4 to 5years Customer relationships
4 to 8years Other intangibles
2 to 7years Revenue recognition:Advent recognizes revenue from term license, maintenance, other recurring; perpetual license fees; and
professional services and
other. Advent offers a wide variety of products and 
79 
Table of Contents ADVENT SOFTWARE,INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued services
to a large number of financially sophisticated customers. While many of the Company lower-priced license transactions, maintenance contracts, subscription-based transactions and
professional services projects conform to a standard structure, many of Advent larger transactions are complex and may require significant review and judgment in Advent application of generally
accepted accounting principles. 
Software license fees.Advent recognizes revenue from the licensing of software when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the
product has
been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Advent generally uses a signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement. Revenue is
recognized once shipment to the distributor customer has taken place and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Delivery occurs when a product is delivered to a common carrier
F.O.B shipping point, or upon confirmation that product delivered F.O.B shipping destination has been received, or upon notification that software is available for electronic download through the
Company fulfillment vendor. Some of Advent arrangements include acceptance provisions, and if such acceptance provisions are present, delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance. Advent assesses
whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. The Company assesses whether the collectability of the resulting receivable is probable based on a
number of factors, including the credit worthiness of the customer determined through review of credit reports, Advent transaction history with the customer, other available information and
pertinent country risk if the customer is located outside the United States. Advent standard payment terms are due at 180days or less but payment terms may vary based on the country in which
the agreement is executed. Software licenses are sold with maintenance and, frequently, professional services. Advent
typically licenses its products on a per server, per user basis with the price per customer varying based on the selection of the products licensed, the assets under
administration, the number of site installations and the number of authorized users. Advent has continued its transition from selling mostly perpetual licenses to selling a mix of term and perpetual
licenses, and the Company expects
term license revenue to increase as a proportion of total recurring revenues which Advent defines as term license, maintenance and other recurring revenues in the future. Term license revenue
comprised approximately 32%, 22%, and 14% of total recurring revenues in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Revenue recognition for software licensed under term and perpetual license models differs
depending on which type of contract a customer signs: Term licenses Term
license contracts include both the software license and maintenance services. Advent offers multi-year term licenses by which a customer makes a binding commitment that typically
spans three years. For multi-year term licenses, Advent has not established vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value for the software license and maintenance components
and, as a result, in situations where the Company is also performing related professional services, it defers all revenue and directly related expenses under the arrangement until the implementation
services are complete and the remaining services are substantially complete. At the point professional services are substantially completed, Advent recognizes a pro-rata amount of the term
license revenue, professional services fees earned and related expenses, based on the elapsed time from the start of the term license to the substantial completion of professional services. The
Company determines whether services are substantially complete by consulting with the professional services group and applying management judgment. Term license revenue for the remaining contract
years and the remaining deferred professional services revenue and related expenses are recognized 80 
Table of Contents ADVENT SOFTWARE,INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued ratably
over the remaining contract length. When multi-year term licenses are sold and do not include related professional services, Advent recognizes the entire term license revenue
ratably over the period of the contract term from the effective date of the license agreement assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Revenues from term licenses are included in
Term license, maintenance and other recurring revenues on the consolidated statement of operations.  Perpetual licenses Advent
allocates revenue to delivered components, normally the license component of the arrangement, using the residual method, based on VSOE of fair value of the undelivered elements generally the
maintenance and professional services components, which is specific to the Company. Advent determines the fair value of the undelivered elements based on the historical evidence of the Company
stand-alone sales of these elements to third parties and/or renewal rates. If VSOE of fair value does not exist for any undelivered elements, then the entire arrangement fee is deferred until
delivery of that element has occurred, unless the only undelivered element is maintenance in which case the entire arrangement fee would be recognized ratably over the maintenance period. Revenues
from perpetual licenses are included in Perpetual license fees revenue on the consolidated statement of operations. Certain
of Advent perpetual and term license contracts include asset-based fee structures that provide additional revenues based on the assets that the client manages using the
Company software Assets Under Administration or AUA. Contracts containing an AUA fee structure have a defined measurement period which requires the client to self-report actual AUA
in arrears of the specified period. AUA fees above the stated minimum fee for the same period are considered incremental fees. Because incremental fees are not determinable until the conclusion of the
measurement period, they are both earned and recognized upon completion of the measurement period, on a quarterly or annual basis. Incremental fees from perpetual AUA contracts are included in
Perpetual license fees on the consolidated statement of operations. Incremental fees from term AUA contracts are included in Term license, maintenance and other recurring revenue on the
consolidated statement of operations. 
For
contracts signed prior to 2006, the Company recognizes both the minimum and incremental value of the AUA fees upon receipt of the customer AUA report. In 2006, the Company
concluded that it gained sufficient experience in working with these types of arrangements to conclude that the minimum fees are fixed and determinable at inception of the contract instead of upon
conclusion of the measurement period. Therefore, for contracts signed since 2006, the Company recognizes AUA contract minimum fees over the period of service and continues to recognize incremental
fees in arrears once clients contractually report the AUA to the company, because the incremental fees are not determinable until reported. 
If
a customer purchased Advent software and chose to enter into a soft dollar arrangement through the Company in-house broker/dealer subsidiary, Second Street Securities,
the soft dollar arrangement did not change or modify the original fixed or determinable fee in the written contract. The customer is required to pay the original fee for the Company software within
one year. If insufficient trading volume is generated to pay the entire original fee within one year, the customer is still required to render payment within one year. In 2006, Advent completed the
wind down of its soft dollar business. However, customers may continue to enter into a soft dollar arrangement through a third-party broker/dealer to purchase Advent software. The original payment
terms apply, regardless of the arrangement with the third-party broker/dealer. The option to soft dollar a transaction does not alter the underlying revenue recognition for the transaction; all the
revenue recognition criteria listed in

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued the
Software licenses section above must be assessed in determining how the revenue will be recognized. 
Maintenance and other recurring revenues.Advent offers annual maintenance programs on perpetual licenses that provide for technical
support and
updates to the Company software products. Maintenance fees are bundled with perpetual license fees in the initial licensing year and charged separately for renewals of annual maintenance in
subsequent years. Fair value for maintenance is based upon either renewal rates stated in the contracts or separate sales of renewals to customers. Generally, Advent recognizes maintenance revenue
ratably over the contract term. 
Advent
offers other recurring revenue services that are either subscription-based or transaction-based, and primarily include the provision of software interfaces to, and the capability
to download securities information from, third party data providers. The Company recognizes revenue from recurring revenue transactions either ratably over the subscription period or as the
transactions occur based on the terms of the arrangement. 
Professional services and other revenues.Advent offers a variety of professional services that include project management,
implementation, data
conversion, integration, custom report writing and training. Fair value for professional services is based upon separate sales of these services by the Company to customers. Advent professional
services are generally billed based on hourly rates together with reimbursement for travel and accommodation expenses. Advent generally recognizes revenue as these professional services are performed,
except when sold with multi-year term license contracts which are described in the term licenses section above. Certain professional services arrangements involve acceptance criteria. In
these cases, revenue and related expenses are recognized upon acceptance. Advent professional services and other revenue also include revenue from the Company annual user conferences. 
Commission
revenues received from soft dollar transactions for products and services not related to the Company products and services are recorded as other revenues on a net basis as
Advent is not the primary obligor in these transactions. Revenues from these soft dollar transactions are recognized on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur. 
Directly related expenses.When Advent defers service revenues, it also defers the direct costs incurred in the delivery of those
services to the
extent those costs are recoverable through the future revenues on non-cancellable contracts as prepaid contract expense. Advent recognizes those deferred costs as costs of professional
services revenues proportionally and over the same period that the deferred revenue is recognized as service revenue. When Advent defers license revenue, the Company defers the direct incremental
costs incurred as a result of selling the contract i.e.sales commissions earned by the sales force as a part of their overall compensation because those costs would not have been incurred
but for the acquisition of that contract. Advent recognizes those costs as sales and marketing expense proportionally and over the same period as the license revenues. Allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns:Advent analyzes specific accounts receivable, historical bad debts, customer
concentrations,
customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Advent has recorded a provision for
bad debt of $06million, $01million and $10million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
Advent
also analyzes customer demand and acceptance of product and historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns, which are not generally provided to 
82 
Table of Contents ADVENT SOFTWARE,INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued customers.
Allowances for sales returns are accounted for as deductions to net revenues and increases to reserves within deferred revenues. Advent standard practice is to enforce its contract terms
and not allow its customers to return software. The Company has, however, allowed customers to return software on a limited case-by-case basis. There are two situations where
it provides a contractual limited right of return to end-user customers only: in shrink-wrap license agreements for Advent products, and certain MicroEdge products. The
shrink-wrap license agreement for Advent products provides for a right of return within seven days of delivery of the software. Certain MicroEdge software license agreements allow for
either a thirty-day money back guarantee or a seven-day right of return. 
Advent
has the ability to estimate returns based on a long history of experience with relatively homogenous transactions and the fact that the return period is short. The Company has
recorded sales returns provisions as offsets to revenue in the period the sales return becomes probable, in accordance with FASB Statement No48, Revenue Recognition when Right of Return
Exists. The estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns and other related factors. Advent has a methodology for calculating the value of reserves that takes
the previous 12months of experience into account. Advent has recorded a sales returns provision benefit to decrease increase revenue for these situations based on the Company historical
experience of $02million, $01 million and $08 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
Advertising costs:The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred and classifies these costs under sales and marketing expense.
Total advertising
expenses were $09million, $09million, and $07million for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Stock-based compensation:Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the
fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. 
Advent
uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, stock appreciation rights SAR and employee stock purchase plan shares. The fair value
of the Company restricted stock units is calculated based on the fair market value of Advent stock on the date of grant. The determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the
date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by Advent stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include Advent expected
stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. 
As
the stock-based compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, such amount
has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on the Company historical experience over the last ten years. Previously, under SFAS123, the Company recorded forfeitures as they
occurred. 
Advent
makes quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the Company tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies which require recognition in the Company consolidated
statements of operations. 
Restructuring charges and related accruals:Advent has developed and implemented formalized plans for restructuring the business to
better align its
resources to market conditions and recorded significant charges in its Advent Investment Management and MicroEdge operating segments. In connection with these plans, Advent has recorded estimated
expenses for severance and benefits, lease 
83 
Table of Contents ADVENT SOFTWARE,INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued cancellations,
asset write-offs and other restructuring costs. Given the significance of, and the timing of the execution of such activities, this process is complex and involves periodic
reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made, including evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy periods and sub-lease rental income.
Advent continually evaluates the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under its restructuring initiatives. Although the Company believes that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of its
restructuring plans, actual results may differ, thereby requiring Advent to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions. Income taxes:Advent accounts for worldwide income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the expected future tax
consequences of
temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities be recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax assets
to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. 
The
Company has elected to use the with and without approach as described in EITF Topic No.D-32 in determining the order in which tax attributes are utilized. As a
result, the Company will only recognize a tax benefit from stock-based awards in additional paid-in capital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes
currently available to the Company have been utilized. In addition, the Company has elected to account for the impact of stock-based awards on other tax attributes, such as the research tax credit,
through the consolidated statement of operations. 
During
the fourth quarter of 2006, Advent determined that there was sufficient positive evidence to support a significant decrease in the Company valuation allowance. As a result of
this release of a majority of its valuation allowance and recognition of deferred tax assets, Advent financial statements for fiscal 2006 reflect an increase in assets on its balance sheet, a
decrease in goodwill relating to the recognition of acquired deferred tax assets that were offset by a valuation allowance in purchase accounting and a tax benefit to the Company statement of
operations in the amount of the reversal. 
Net income per share:Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for
that period. Diluted net income per share is computed giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential shares consist of incremental
common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and stock appreciation rights, vesting of restricted stock units and conversion of preferred stock none outstanding for all periods, except in
situations where inclusion is anti-dilutive. 
Comprehensive income:Comprehensive income consists of net income, net unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments and net
unrealized gains
or losses on available-for-sale marketable securities and is presented in the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity and comprehensive income. 
Segment information:The Company has determined that it has the following two reportable segments: 1Advent Investment Management,
and
2MicroEdge. Advent Investment Management derives revenues from the development, marketing and sale of software products, data interfaces and related maintenance and services that automate,
integrate and support certain mission-critical functions of
investment management organizations. MicroEdge derives revenues from the sale of software and services for grant management, matching gifts and volunteer tracking for the grantmaking community. 
International
sales, which are based on the location to which the product is shipped or services are delivered, represented 14%, 12%, and 12% of the Company net revenues for fiscal
2008, 2007 and

Table of Contents ADVENT SOFTWARE,INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 2006,
respectively. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues for fiscal 2008, 2007 or 2006. Certain risks and concentrations:Product revenues are concentrated in the investment management software industry, which is highly
competitive and
rapidly changing. Significant technological changes in the industry or customer requirements, or the emergence of competitive products with new capabilities or technologies could adversely affect
operating results. Additionally, Advent derives a significant portion of its revenues from its Axys, Geneva and Advent Portfolio Exchange applications and ancillary products and services, and
therefore their market acceptance is essential to the Company success. 
Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risks comprise, principally, cash, cash equivalents, and trade accounts receivable. Advent invests
excess cash through banks, mutual funds, and brokerage houses primarily in highly liquid securities and has investment policies and procedures that attempt to minimize credit risk. Advent marketable
securities consist of diversified investment grade securities traded in the United States of America. The Company believes no significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to these
securities. 
With
respect to accounts receivable, Advent performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains reserves for potential
credit losses on customer accounts when deemed necessary. At December31, 2008 and 2007, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable. Common Stock Repurchases:Advent accounts for common stock repurchases by allocating the cash paid in excess of par value to additional
paid-in capital and accumulated deficit. The Company calculates the average additional paid-in capital per outstanding share at the beginning of each monthly period in which
stock was repurchased and records the difference between the repurchase price per share and the sum of the par value and average paid-in capital per share as an increase to accumulated
deficit. 
Reclassifications:Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. These reclassifications do
not affect
total net revenues, net income or stockholders' equity. When Advent adopted FIN48 on January1, 2007, the Company presented its reserve for uncertain tax positions balance as a
component of other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. In 2008, the Company reclassified the portion of this balance relating to tax credits that had not been
utilized on a tax return as reductions to the associated deferred tax assets. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation as follows: December31, 2007 As Previously

Fiscal 2008 Acquisition 
On October1, 2008, Advent completed the acquisition of Tamale Software,Inc. Tamale. Tamale provides software
solutions designed specifically to help investment professionals manage their investment ideas more effectively and easily access all of the firm research. The total preliminary purchase price of
approximately $68million includes cash of $28million and 906,000 shares of common stock valued at approximately $40million. The value of the equity consideration was calculated
using the average closing stock price on the two days before and after, as well as the date of, the announcement date of the acquisition. The per share value was calculated to be $4406. 
Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation 
In accordance with SFAS No141, the total purchase price was allocated to net tangible and intangible assets based on their
estimated fair values as of October1, 2008. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable assets was recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price
is preliminary because Tamale final tax filings are not yet complete. A final determination of required purchase accounting adjustments will be made during 2009. The allocation of the preliminary
purchase price and the estimated useful lives associated with certain assets is as follows: Estimated

purchase price of $68million was paid during the fourth quarter of 2008. Of the issuable shares, 226,098 shares of the Company common stock were held in escrow and are
expected to be released in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
Tangible assets and current liabilities 
Tamale tangible assets and liabilities as of October1, 2008 were reviewed and adjusted to their fair value as necessary.
Current assets include accounts receivable, inventory and other current assets. Non-current assets are primarily comprised of facility deposits and fixed assets. Current liabilities were
fair valued and include accrued liabilities, direct costs associated with the acquisition and deferred revenues. In connection with the acquisition of Tamale, Advent assumed Tamale contractual
obligations related to its deferred revenue. Tamale deferred revenue was derived primarily from subscription services. As a result, Advent recorded an adjustment to reduce the carrying value of
deferred revenue to represent the Company estimate of the fair value of the contractual obligations assumed. 
Identifiable intangible assets 
Existing technology relates to Tamale Research Management Solution RMS product modules that have reached technological feasibility.
Core technology represents a combination of Tamale processes, technology and trade secrets that are the building blocks for current and planned new versions of existing products. Advent is
amortizing the fair value of these assets to cost of revenues in the consolidated statement of operations on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives of 5years.

Non-competition
agreements represent agreements which allow Advent to operate without competition from specified Tamale employees. Advent is amortizing the fair value of this
asset to operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations on a straight-line basis over an estimated life of 2years. 
Goodwill 
Approximately $497million of the purchase price has been allocated to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase
price over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets. The goodwill was attributed to the premium paid for the opportunity to better leverage Tamale technology utilizing
Advent broader market reach in order to achieve greater long-term growth opportunities. 
In
accordance with SFAS No142, goodwill will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if certain indicators are present as
part of the Advent Investment Management segment. In the event that management determines that the fair value of goodwill has become impaired, the Company would incur an accounting charge for the
amount of impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  In-process research and development IPRD 
During fiscal 2008, Advent wrote-off acquired IPRD of $400,000 in connection with its acquisition of Tamale. The IPRD was
written off because the acquired technologies had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses. Technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to completion of a working
prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development. At the time of the acquisition, Tamale was developing a new module, Tamale Central, which qualified as IPRD. At the time of
acquisition, it was estimated that these IPRD efforts would be completed over the following 3months at an estimated total cost of $109,000. The
value assigned to IPRD was determined by estimating costs to develop the purchased IPRD into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flow from the projects
when completed, and discounting the net cash flows to their present value. The revenue estimates used in the cash flow forecasts were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors,
expected trends in technology, and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by Tamale and its competitors. 
The
rate utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value was based on Tamale weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital was adjusted to
reflect the difficulties and uncertainties in completing each project and thereby achieving technological feasibility, the percentage of completion of each project, anticipated market acceptance and
penetration, market growth rates, and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets. Based on these factors, a discount rate of 21% was deemed appropriate for valuing the
IPRD. 
The
estimates used in valuing IPRD were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or
inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur.

assumed Vivid Orange contractual obligations related to its deferred revenue. Vivid Orange deferred revenue was derived from hosting, subscription, and consulting services. As a result, Advent
recorded an adjustment to reduce the carrying value of deferred revenue by $41,000 to $120,000, which represents the Company estimate of the fair value of the contractual obligations assumed.

During fiscal 2007, Advent wrote-off acquired IPRD of $150,000 in connection with its acquisition of Vivid Orange. The
IPRD was written off because the acquired technologies had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses. Technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to completion of
a working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development. At the time of the acquisition, Vivid Orange was developing a new module, SmartWorld, which qualified as IPRD. At
the time of acquisition, it was estimated that these IPRD efforts would be completed over the following 6months at an estimated total cost of $64,000. 
The

in order to reduce its operating costs and focus resources on key strategic priorities impacting a total of 13 full time positions mainly in the United States. In connection with this
restructuring plan, Advent recorded restructuring charges totaling $04million related to termination benefits for the elimination of these 13 positions. As of December31, 2008 01million was paid. The remaining accrual associated with these termination benefits is expected to be paid during the first quarter of 2009. The Company also recorded additional
restructuring charges which related to a partial lease surrender fee of $02million to exit the data center portion of our facility space located at 303 2ndStreet in San
Francisco, California. These restructuring charges were partially offset by adjustments to other facility exit assumptions. During
2007, Advent recorded aggregate restructuring charges of $10million which primarily related to the modification of certain sub-lease assumptions for its prior
San Francisco headquarters facility located at 301 Brannan Street, which the Company exited in October 2006. 
For
fiscal 2006, Advent recorded total restructuring charges of $37million which primarily related to facility and exit costs associated with the relocation of its corporate
headquarters facility in San Francisco during the fourth quarter of 2006. Restructuring charges in 2006 also included costs associated with exiting a portion of the Company facility in New Rochelle,
New York, and an entire facility in Summit, New Jersey, and adjustments to original estimates for facilities in San Francisco, California and New York, New York.

Note7Debt 
On February14, 2007, Advent and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a senior secured credit facility agreement the
Credit Facility with Wells Fargo Foothill,Inc. the Lender for a term of three years. Under the Credit Facility, the Lender will provide the Company with a revolving line of credit up to
an aggregate amount of $750million to fund the repurchase of outstanding common stock, capital expenditures and general corporate requirements. The Company has the option of selecting an
interest rate for any drawdown under the Credit Facility equal to either: athe Base Rate Wells Fargo prime rate; or bthe then applicable LIBOR Rate plus 150% per annum. The loan
is secured by the Company property and assets and is subject to a financial covenant. The financial covenant in the Credit Facility is limited to a maximum ratio of senior debt to earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA, adjusted for cost capitalizations, extraordinary gains losses and non-cash stock-based employee compensation. Covenant testing
will commence upon either the occurrence of an event of default or when excess availability, defined as the Credit Facility line of $750million less amounts drawn, plus qualified cash and
cash equivalents is less than $500million. 
In
June 2007, the Company drew down $250million against this Facility which bore interest at an aggregate rate of 686%, consisting of a three month LIBOR contract rate of 536%
and an applicable margin of 15%. In September 2007, the LIBOR contract expired and the Company paid down the credit facility by $50million. Advent re-entered into another LIBOR
rate contract on the remaining $200million which bore a three-month LIBOR contract rate of 558% and an applicable margin of 15% for an aggregate rate of 708%. In December 2007, the LIBOR
contract expired and the Company paid down the Credit Facility by $200million resulting in a zero balance as of December31, 2007. As of December31, 2007, Advent was in
compliance with all associated covenants. 
In
November 2008, the Company drew down another $250million against its Credit Facility which bore interest at the Wells Fargo prime rate of 40%. As of December31,
2008, the outstanding debt balance was $250million and Advent was in compliance with all associated covenants.  Note8Income Taxes

by recurring revenue streams. Therefore, the valuation allowance was decreased by $836million in the fourth quarter of 2006. As
of December31, 2008, Advent made no provision for a cumulative total of $54million of undistributed earnings for certain non-US subsidiaries, which are
deemed to be permanently reinvested.

Company maintains a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets relating to capital losses and investment reserves of $62million and certain state net operating
losses of $687,000 as it believes that based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized. The capital loss carryforwards expire between 2009 and
2011. If it is determined in the future that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized, the valuation allowance will be further reduced. 
At
December31, 2008, Advent had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $117million, which includes stock-based compensation deductions of
$62million. Utilization of these loss carryforwards, including losses obtained from acquisitions, is subject to certain limitations under the federal income tax laws. These net operating loss
carryforwards expire between 2021 and 2027. Also at December31, 2008, Advent had state net operating loss carryforwards in various states in which it files tax returns. 
Advent
had federal research credits of $173million which expire between 2012 and 2028. Advent also had California research credits of $137million and California

recognized, the portion of unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2008 that would decrease Advent tax provision and increase net income is $58million. The impact
on net income reflects the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits net of the federal tax benefit of state income tax items. Advent recognizes interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax
benefits as well as interest received from favorable settlements within Provision for benefit from income taxes on the consolidated statement of operations. As of December31, 2008, Advent
has not accrued any interest or penalties as part of its FIN48 reserve as any reversal of uncertain tax positions would not result in the assessment of penalties or interest due to the
Company surplus of deferred tax assets that would offset any additional tax. 
Advent
is subject to taxation in the US and various states and foreign jurisdictions. Advent is not under examination in any income tax jurisdiction at the present time and does not
anticipate the total amount of its unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change over the next 12months. The material jurisdictions that are subject to examination by tax authorities
include California for tax years after 2003 and the US and New York for tax years after 2004.

2006, Advent entered into a lease agreement for the Company facilities located at 600 Townsend in San Francisco, California, and in October 2006, Advent extended its lease agreement for its
facilities located at 619 West 54thStreet in New York, New York. During 2007, the Company executed several amendments to the lease agreement for its 600 Townsend facility whereby
the Company will lease additional facility space of 50,000 square feet.

Indemnifications 
As permitted or required under Delaware law and to the maximum extent allowable under that law, Advent has certain obligations to
indemnify its current and former officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at Advent request in such capacity. These indemnification
obligations are valid as long as the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The maximum potential amount of future
payments Advent could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited; however, Advent has a director and officer insurance policy that mitigates Advent exposure and enables
Advent to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal.  Legal Contingencies 
On March8, 2005, certain of the former shareholders of Kinexus and the shareholders' representative filed suit against Advent
in the Delaware Chancery Court. The complaint alleges that Advent breached the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of December31, 2001 pursuant to which Advent acquired all of the
outstanding shares of Kinexus due principally to the fact that no amount was paid by Advent on an earn-out of up to $115million. The earn-out, which was payable in cash
or stock at the election of Advent, was based upon Kinexus meeting certain revenue targets in both 2002 and 2003. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, an accounting and restitution
for unjust enrichment. Advent advised the shareholders' representative in January 2003 that the earn-out terms had not been met in 2002 and accordingly no earn-out was payable
for 2002 and would not be payable for 2003. Discovery is continuing between the parties. Advent disputes the plaintiffs' claims and believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously
defend this action. Management believes that any potential loss associated with this litigation is neither probable nor reasonably estimable at this time and accordingly has not accrued any amounts
for any potential loss. 
From
time to time, Advent is involved in claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Based on currently available information, management does not believe
that the 
103 
Table of Contents ADVENT SOFTWARE,INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued ultimate
outcome of these unresolved matters, individually and in the aggregate, is likely to have a material adverse effect on Advent financial position or results of operations. However,
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and Advent view of these matters may change in the future. Were an unfavorable outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse
impact on Advent financial position and results of operations for the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs, and potentially in future periods.

Prior
to the adoption of SFAS123R, the Company used historical volatility in deriving its expected volatility assumption. The expected stock price volatility for fiscal 2008,
2007 and 2006 was determined based on an equally weighted average of historical and implied volatility of the Company common stock. Advent determined that a blend of implied volatility and
historical volatility is more reflective of the market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility. The expected life for fiscal 2008, 2007 and
2006 was determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee
behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on the US Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option or SAR. The
dividend yield assumption is based on the Company history of not paying dividends and the resultant future expectation of zero dividend payouts. The
fair value of RSUs on the date of grant is the Advent closing share price.

Non-statutory Stock Option Plan the Non-statutory Plan and the 1995 Director Option Plan the Director Plan. 
The Plan.On May7, 2008 the Company stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of Advent 2002 Stock Plan, originally
approved by
the Board of Directors the Board and stockholders in February and May, respectively, of 2002. Under the Plan, the Company may grant options to purchase common stock to employees, consultants and
directors. Options granted may be incentive stock options or non-statutory stock options and shall be granted at a price not less than fair market value on the date of grant. Fair market
value as defined in the Plan and the vesting of these options shall be determined by the Board. The options generally vest over 5years and expire no later than 10years from the date
of grant. The Company settles employee stock option exercises with newly issued common shares. The Plan permits the award of restricted stock, RSUs, SARs, performance shares, and performance units
under the Plan. 
During
2008, 2007 and 2006, Advent granted RSUs and stock-settled SARs. The RSUs are awards of restricted stock units that generally vest over four years in two equal installments on the
second and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant. Upon vesting, the RSUs will convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The value of the RSUs is based on the closing market
price of the Company common stock on the date of grant and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the four-year requisite service period. A SAR is the right to receive
the appreciation in fair market value of common stock between the exercise date and the date of grant and generally vests over 5years. Upon exercise, SARs will be settled in shares of Advent
common stock. Unvested RSUs and SARs are canceled on termination of employment and returned to the Plan.

Non-Statutory Plan.In November 1998, the Board approved the 1998 Non-statutory Stock Option Plan and reserved 300,000 shares
of common stock for issuance thereunder. Under the Company 1998 Non-statutory Plan, Advent may grant options to purchase common stock to employees and consultants, excluding persons who
are executive
officers and directors. Options granted are non-statutory stock options and shall be granted at a price not less than fair market value on the date of grant. Fair market value as defined
in the Non-statutory Plan and the vesting of these options shall be determined by the Board. The options generally vest over 5years and expire no later than 10years from
the date of grant. Unvested options on termination of employment are canceled and returned to the Non-statutory Plan. On February26, 2007, the Board terminated the
Non-statutory Plan. 
Director Plan.Advent Director Plan, which expired on November16, 2005, provided for the grant of non-statutory stock options
to the Company non-employee directors outside directors. As noted above, effective April1, 2005, option grants to outside directors are issued under the 2002 Stock Plan.

Note13Segment, Significant Customer and Geographical Information  Description of Segments  Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated
regularly by the chief operating decision maker CODM, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Advent CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. 
Advent
organizational structure is based on a number of factors that the CODM uses to evaluate, view and run its business operations which include, but are not limited to, customer
base, homogeneity of products and technology. Advent operating segments are based on this organizational structure and information reviewed by Advent CODM to evaluate the operating segment
results. Advent has determined that its operations are organized into two reportable segments: 1Advent Investment Management; and 2MicroEdge. Future changes to this organizational
structure may result in changes to the business segments disclosed. 
Advent
Investment Management is the Company core business and derives revenues from the development, marketing and sale of software products, data interfaces and related maintenance
and services that automate, integrate and support certain mission-critical functions of investment management organizations. MicroEdge derives revenues from the sale of software and services for grant
management, matching gifts and volunteer tracking for the grant-making community.  Segment Data  The results of the operating segments are derived directly from Advent internal management reporting system. The accounting policies
used to derive operating segment results are substantially the same as those used by the consolidated company. Management measures the performance of each operating segment based on several metrics,
including income loss from operations. These results are used, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and to assign resources to, each of the operating segments. Certain operating expenses,
including stock-based compensation and amortization and impairment of developed technology and other intangibles, which Advent manages separately at the

Effective January1, 2008, Advent implemented SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurement, for the Company financial assets
and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value
at least annually. In accordance with the provisions of FSP No. FAS157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No157, the Company has elected to defer implementation of
FAS157 as it relates to non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring
basis until January1, 2009. Advent is evaluating the impact, if any; this will have on the Company non-financial assets and liabilities. The
adoption of SFAS157 to Advent financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value at least
annually did not have an impact on the Company financial results. 
SFAS
No157 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a
basis for considering such assumptions, SFAS No157 establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: Level Input 
Input Definition LevelI
Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date. LevelII
Inputs other than quoted prices included in LevelI that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with market data at the measurement date. LevelIII
Unobservable inputs that reflect management best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. This
hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining inputs and determining fair value. The
Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis and the fair 
114 
Table of Contents ADVENT SOFTWARE,INC.

of these certain financial assets was determined using the following inputs as of December31, 2008 in thousands: Fair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using Total

Money
market funds consist of cash equivalents with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and are composed primarily of US government and treasury
obligation money market mutual funds. The fair value of these securities is determined through market, observable and corroborated sources. SFAS
No159, The Fair Value of Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities SFAS159 became effective on January1, 2008. SFAS159 provides
companies with an option to irrevocably elect to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis with the
resulting changes in fair value recorded in earnings. The objective of SFAS159 is to reduce both the complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by
using different measurement attributes for financial assets or financial liabilities. As of January1, 2008 and for the year ended December31, 2008, the Company has elected not to apply
the fair value option to any of its financial assets or liabilities on-hand, which were not already measured at fair value, because the Company does not believe the application of
SFAS159 fair value option is appropriate, given the nature of its business operations. 
The
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value based on the short-term maturities of
these instruments. In accordance with SFAS No107, Disclosures About Fair Value Instruments at December31, 2008, the fair value of the Company debt was estimated at
$24million, using quoted market prices and yields for the same or similar type of borrowings, taking into account the underlying terms of the debt instruments. At December31, 2008, the
carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value of the debt by $1million. 
Non-marketable
investments, which totaled $05million at December31, 2008, represent the Company investments in a privately held company.
Non-marketable investments are priced at the lower of cost and reviewed for impairment due to an absence of market activity and market data, and are not reported in the above table of
assets measured at fair value as of December31, 2008.  Note15Subsequent Events

the repurchase program that was approved by the Board of Directors on October30, 2008, at an average price of $2151.
