48            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Amkor Technology, Inc.   In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of another auditor, the
consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Amkor Technology,
Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the
financial statements of Amkor Technology Philippines, Inc. formerly Amkor
Technology Philippines P1/P2, Inc. and Amkor Technology Philippines P3/P4,
Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary, referred to herein as ATP, which combined
financial statements reflect total assets of 14% and operating expenses of 14%
of the related consolidated totals as of and for the year ended December 31,
2002. The combined financial statements of ATP for 2002 were audited by another
auditor whose report thereon has been furnished to us, and our opinion expressed
herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for ATP, is based solely
on the report of the other auditor. The financial statements of ATP as of
December 31, 2001, and for each of the two years in the period ended December
31, 2001 were audited by other independent accountants who have ceased
operations. Those independent accountants expressed an unqualified opinion on
those financial statements in their report dated March 19, 2002. In addition, in
our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein
when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and the report of the other auditor provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 2 and Note 3, the Company adopted Statements of

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amkor
Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements
reflect  the elimination  of all  significant intercompany  accounts and
transactions. The investments in and the operating results of 20% to 50% owned
companies are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity
method of accounting.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain
previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current
presentation.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of the majority of our
subsidiaries in Korea and the Philippines, and the foreign currency asset and
liability amounts at these subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars at
end-of-period exchange rates, except for nonmonetary items which are remeasured
at historical rates. Foreign currency income and expenses are remeasured at
average exchange rates in effect during the year, except for expenses related to
balance sheet amounts remeasured at historical exchange rates. Exchange gains
and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary
assets and liabilities are included in other income expense in the period in
which they occur.
The local currency is the functional currency of our subsidiaries in Japan,
Taiwan and China, and the asset and liability amounts of these subsidiaries are
translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. The resulting
translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive loss in the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheets.
Assets and liabilities denominated in currency other than the local currency are
remeasured into the local currency prior to translation into U.S. dollars, and
the resultant exchange gains or losses are included in other income expense in
the period in which they occur. Income and expenses are translated into U.S.
dollars at average exchange rates in effect during the period.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments, for which we are subject to credit risk, consist
principally of accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and marketable securities. With respect to accounts receivable, we
mitigate our credit risk by selling primarily to well established companies,
performing ongoing credit evaluations  and making frequent contact  with
customers. We have historically mitigated our credit risk with respect to cash
and cash equivalents, as well as short-term investments, through diversification
of our holdings into various money market accounts, U.S. treasury bonds, federal
mortgage backed securities, high grade municipal bonds, commercial paper and
preferred stocks.
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Our  future results of  operations involve a  number of risks and
uncertainties. Factors that could affect future operating results and cause
actual results to vary materially from historical results include, but are not
limited to, dependence on the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor
industry, the continuing negative impacts of the unprecedented industry downturn
beginning in 2001, our high leverage and the restrictive covenants contained in
the agreements governing our indebtedness, uncertainty as to the demand from our
customers over both the long- and short-term, competitive pricing and declines
in average selling prices we experience, the timing and volume of orders
relative to our production capacity, the absence of significant backlog in our
business, fluctuations in manufacturing yields, the availability of financing,
our competition, our
54
AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
dependence on international operations and sales, our dependence on raw material
and equipment suppliers, exchange rate fluctuations, our dependence on key
personnel,  difficulties  integrating  acquisitions,  the  enforcement  of
intellectual property rights by or against us, our need to comply with existing
and future environmental regulations, the results of Anam Semiconductor, Inc.
ASI as it impacts our financial results and political and economic
uncertainty resulting from terrorist activities.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months
or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
principally by using a moving average method. In general we order raw materials
based on the customers forecasted demand and we do not maintain any finished
goods inventory. If our customers change their forecasted requirements and we
are unable to cancel our raw materials order or if our vendor requires that we
order a minimum quantity that exceeds the current forecasted demand, we will
experience a build-up in raw material inventory. We will either seek to recover
the cost of the materials from our customers or utilize the inventory in
production. However, we may not be successful in recovering the cost from our
customers or being able to use the inventory in production, which we would
consider as part of our reserve estimate. Our reserve for excess and obsolete
inventory is based on forecasted demand we receive from our customers. When a
determination is made that the inventory will not be utilized in production it
is written-off and disposed.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property,  plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is
calculated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
depreciable assets. Accelerated methods are used for tax purposes. Depreciable
lives follow                              
Buildings and  10 to 30 years
Machinery and   3 to 7 years
Furniture, fixtures and other   3 to 10 years   Effective with the fourth quarter of 2002, we changed the estimated useful
lives of certain of our packaging equipment from four years to seven years for
depreciation purposes, which is in line with our historical usage. This change
decreased our net loss by approximately $167 million, or $010 per share. There
was no offsetting impact to our tax provision related to the change in useful
lives because of our consolidated net losses for 2002 and our recognition of a
valuation allowance against the associated net operating loss carryforwards see
Note 17.
Cost and accumulated depreciation for property retired or disposed of are
removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in
earnings. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred. Depreciation expense was $3176 million, $3567 million and $2620
million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES
Goodwill is recorded when the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair
market value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. On
January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
see Note 4. The new standard requires that goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible  assets no  longer be  amortized. In  addition, goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually.
These tests are performed more frequently if warranted. Impairment losses are
recorded when
55
AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Such impairment
losses are recorded as a part of income from continuing operations.
Definite-lived intangible assets include acquired patents and technology
rights and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives, generally for periods ranging from 5 to 10 years. We continually evaluate
the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets. The unamortized balances
recorded for acquired intangibles are evaluated periodically for potential
impairment. An impairment loss, if any, would be measured as the excess of the
carrying value over the fair value. Such impairment losses are recorded as a
part of income from continuing operations.
OTHER NONCURRENT ASSETS
Other noncurrent assets consist principally of a note receivable which is
related to our sale of ASI stock to Dongbu see Note 7, deferred debt issuance
costs, security deposits, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies,
deferred income taxes and tax credits. As discussed in Note 17, significant tax
valuation allowances related to our deferred tax assets were recorded during
2002.
DUE FROM AND TO AFFILIATES
Due from affiliates primarily relates to advances made to a Philippine
realty corporation in which we own 40%. Such investment is accounted for under
the equity method of accounting. Given the foreign ownership restrictions in the
Philippines, the affiliated entity owns the land on which our Philippine
factories are located. The affiliated entity has no long-term obligations other
than their obligations to us and we have not extended guarantees or other
commitments to the entity. Due to affiliates primarily relates to  our
transactions with Anam Semiconductor, Inc. see Note 7.
OTHER NONCURRENT LIABILITIES
Other noncurrent liabilities consist primarily of Korean severance plan
obligations, Philippine and Taiwanese pension obligations and noncurrent income
taxes payable.
RECEIVABLE FROM STOCKHOLDER
Amkor Electronics, Inc. AEI, which was merged into our company just
prior to the initial public offering of our company in May 1998, elected to be
taxed as an S Corporation under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 and comparable state tax provisions. As a result, AEI did not recognize
U.S. federal corporate income taxes. Instead, the stockholders of AEI were taxed
on their proportionate share of AEI taxable income. Accordingly, no provision
for U.S. federal income taxes was recorded for AEI. Just prior to the initial
public offering, AEI terminated its S Corporation status at which point the
profits of AEI became subject to federal and state income taxes at the corporate
level. We consummated a tax  indemnification agreement between us,  our
predecessor and James Kim and his family collectively, the Kim Family. James
Kim, is our founder and significant stockholder, and currently serves as our
Chairman and CEO. Under the terms of the tax indemnification agreement, Amkor
indemnified the former owners of AEI for the settlement of AEI S Corporation
federal and state tax returns and any adjustments to the reported taxable
income.
At the time AEI was converted to a C Corporation, AEI and the Kim Family
identified certain federal and state tax overpayments associated with the
results of AEI during S Corporation status years, and AEI, in May 1998, paid
such amounts to the Kim Family. These amounts, which principally related to the
finalization of AEI federal tax return, are reflected as a receivable from
stockholder in the stockholders' equity section of our balance sheets. As the
refunds are paid by the associated taxing authorities and received by the Kim
Family, the Kim Family, in turn, remits the funds to Amkor. During 2002, $04
million of tax refunds were

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
received by the Kim Family and used to pay down the stockholder loan. The loan
balance will be further reduced as AEI tax returns are finalized and refunds
remitted by the associated taxing authorities.
REVENUE RECOGNITION AND RISK OF LOSS
Our company does not take ownership of customer-supplied semiconductor
wafers. Title and risk of loss remains with the customer for these materials at
all times. Accordingly, the cost of the customer-supplied materials is not
included in the consolidated financial statements. Revenues from packaging
semiconductors and performing test services are recognized upon shipment or
completion of the services. We record wafer fabrication services revenues upon
shipment of completed wafers. Such policies are consistent with provisions in
the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.
STOCK COMPENSATION
We apply Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations, to our stock option
plans. These stock option plans are discussed more fully in Note 19, Stock
Compensation Plans. No compensation expense has been recognized for our
employee stock options that have been granted. If compensation costs for our
stock option plans had been determined using the fair value method of accounting
as set forth in SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, our
reported net income loss and earnings loss per share would have been
reduced.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income loss and
earnings loss per share as if the fair value based method had been applied to
all outstanding and unvested awards in each period.                              FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Research and development expenses include costs directly attributable to
the conduct of research and development programs primarily related to the
development of new package designs and improving the efficiency and capabilities
of our existing production process. Such costs include salaries, payroll taxes,
employee benefit costs, materials, supplies, depreciation on and maintenance of
research equipment, fees under licensing agreements, services provided by
outside contractors, and the allocable portions of facility costs such as rent,
utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, depreciation and general support
services. All costs associated with research and development are expensed as
incurred.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB
Interpretation FIN  No. 45,  Guarantor Accounting  and  Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN No. 45 apply
on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002.
As required, we have adopted the disclosure requirements of this interpretation
as of December 31, 2002 see Note 21. We will apply the initial recognition and
measurement provisions on a prospective basis effective January 1, 2003. This
interpretation modifies existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees and
requires that at the time a company issues a guarantee, the company must
recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes
under that guarantee. We are in the process of evaluating the recognition and
measurement provisions of the Interpretation and absent any unforeseen events,
we do not expect that the adoption of these provisions will have a significant
impact on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities. The primary objective of FIN No. 46 is to provide guidance
on the identification of, and financial reporting for, entities over which
control is achieved through means other than voting rights; such entities are
known as variable interest entities. FIN No. 46 requires variable interest
entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the variable interest
entities and expands disclosure requirements for both variable interest entities
that are consolidated as well as those within which an enterprise holds a
significant variable interest. FIN No. 46 is effective immediately for all
variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and is effective no
later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period
beginning after June 15, 2003 for all variable interest entities created prior
to February 1, 2003.
We have variable interests in certain Philippine realty corporations in
which we have a 40% ownership and from whom we lease land and buildings in the
Philippines. The assets and liabilities of these Philippine realty corporations
are not currently consolidated within our financial statements. As of December
31, 2002, the combined book value of the assets and liabilities associated with
these Philippine realty corporations were $217 million and $239 million. Our
maximum exposure related to these variable interest entities is limited by our
investments and loans to these entities of $212 million at December 31, 2002.
In addition to our interests in the Philippine realty corporations, we are
currently reviewing our interests in other entities to determine whether any of
these entities would be variable interest entities. The maximum exposure to loss
as a result of our involvement with any additional variable interest entities
identified is not expected to be an amount materially in excess of interests
currently reflected in our consolidated balance sheet.
In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities
and supercedes Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition
for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity
including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. SFAS No. 146 requires
that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity shall
be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which
the liability is
58
AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
incurred rather than when a company commits to such an activity. We will adopt
this standard beginning with exit or disposal activities that are initiated
after December 31, 2002.
In January 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued Issue No. 00-21
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Issue No. 00-21 primarily
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under
which it will perform multiple revenue-generating activities. Specifically, it
addresses  how to  determine whether  an arrangement  involving multiple
deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting. In applying Issue No.
00-21, separate contracts with the same entity or related parties that are
entered into at or near the same time are presumed to have been negotiated as a
package and should, therefore, be evaluated as a single arrangement in
considering whether there are one or more units of accounting. That presumption
may be overcome if there is sufficient evidence to the contrary. Issue No. 00-21
also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to
the separate units of accounting in the arrangement. The provisions of Issue No.
00-21 are effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods
beginning after June 15, 2003. We are currently evaluating the impact this
statement will have on our financial position or results of operations.

3. SFAS NO. 144, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which supersedes SFAS No. 121. This standard
provides a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by
sale and establishes additional criteria that would have to be met to classify
an asset as held for sale. The carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not
recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to
result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group.
Estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long-lived
asset or asset group must incorporate the entity own assumptions about its use
of the asset or asset group and must factor in all available evidence. SFAS No.
144 requires that long-lived assets be tested for recoverability whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be
recoverable. Such events include significant under-performance relative to the
expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes
in the manner of use of the assets; significant negative industry or economic
trends and significant changes in market capitalization.
Although significant recovery was noted in our company core packaging
services during the second quarter of 2002, our test services assets and several
non-core packaging services assets remained at low utilization rates relative to
our projections, and are no longer expected to reach previously anticipated
utilization levels. In addition, during the second quarter of 2002, we
experienced a significant decline in our market capitalization. These events
triggered an impairment review in accordance with SFAS No. 144. This review
included a company-wide evaluation of underutilized assets that could be sold
and a detailed update of our operating and cash flow projections. As a result of
this analysis, we identified $198 million of test and packaging fixed assets
that we expect to dispose by June 30, 2003. We recognized an $187 million
impairment
59
AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
charge to reduce the carrying value of the test and packaging fixed assets to be
disposed to their fair value less cost to sell. Fair value of the assets to be
disposed was determined with the assistance of an appraisal firm and available
information on the resale value of the equipment. Additionally, we tested for
impairment our long-lived test assets that are held and used, including
intangible assets that we are amortizing, and certain non-core packaging fixed
assets that are held and used. For the test and packaging assets that are held
and used, we recognized a $1716 million impairment charge to reduce the
carrying value of those assets to fair value, including $48 million for the
impairment of test services patents and technology rights. An appraisal firm was
engaged to assist in the determination of the fair value of the assets held for
use. The determination of fair value was based on projected cash flows using a
discount rate commensurate with the risk involved.
4. SFAS NO. 141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND SFAS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, which
prohibits  the  pooling-of-interests  method of  accounting  for business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and addresses the accounting for
purchase method business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. Also in
June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
For existing acquisitions, the provisions of SFAS No. 142 were effective as of
January 1, 2002 and are generally effective for business combinations initiated
after  June 30, 2001.  SFAS No. 142  includes provisions regarding the
reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as  goodwill,
reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles, the
cessation of amortization related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles,
and the testing for impairment of goodwill and other intangibles annually or
more frequently if circumstances warrant. Additionally, SFAS No. 142 requires
that within six months of adoption of SFAS No. 142, goodwill be tested for
impairment at the reporting unit level as of the date of adoption.
We adopted SFAS No. 142 as of January 1, 2002 and we reclassified $300
million of intangible assets previously identified as an assembled workforce
intangible to goodwill. Additionally at adoption of SFAS No. 142, we stopped
amortizing goodwill of $6591 million, as well as goodwill of $1186 million
associated with our investment in ASI accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. The as adjusted financial information below assumes that the
cessation of amortization occurred as of January 1, 2001.

As of the adoption date of the standard, we reassessed the useful lives of
our identified intangibles and they continue to be appropriate. Goodwill and
other intangible assets are attributable to two reporting units, packaging and
test services. We completed the initial impairment test during the second
quarter of 2002. Based on the comparison of the fair value of the reporting
units with their respective carrying values each as of January 1, 2002, we
concluded that goodwill associated with our packaging and test services
reporting units was not impaired as of adoption. An appraisal firm was engaged
to assist in the determination of the fair value of our reporting units. The
determination of fair value was based on projected cash flows using a discount
rate commensurate with the risk involved.
SFAS No. 142 provides that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for
impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances
including a significant adverse change in the business climate and testing for
recoverability of long-lived assets. Our test services assets and several
non-core packaging services assets remained at low utilization rates during the
second quarter of 2002 and were no longer expected to reach previously
anticipated  utilization levels. As discussed in Note 3, we tested the
recoverability of such assets as of June 30, 2002 and concluded that a portion
of those assets was impaired. Accordingly, we retested goodwill for impairment
as of June 30, 2002, and concluded that the carrying value of the assets and
liabilities associated with the test services reporting unit exceeded its fair
value. As of June 30, 2002, we recognized a $731 million goodwill impairment
charge. Such impairment charge was measured by comparing the implied fair value
of the goodwill associated with the test services reporting unit to its carrying
value. An appraisal firm was engaged to assist in the determination of the fair
value of our reporting units. The determination of fair value was based on
projected cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk involved.

5. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
During  2002, we recorded $286 million of charges related to the
consolidation of our worldwide facilities to increase operational efficiency and
reduce costs. The charges were comprised of $208 million to write-off leasehold
improvements and other long-lived assets and $78 million for lease termination
and other exit costs. Our consolidation efforts included   - Transferring the packaging operations at our K2 site in Bucheon, South
Korea into our K4 factory in Kwangju, South Korea and closing the K2
facility   - Merging our factory operations in Taiwan into a single location; and
- Consolidating select U.S. office locations and closing our San Jose test
facility.
The charges associated with the consolidation initiatives in Korea, Taiwan
and the U.S. were $100 million, $138 million and $48 million, respectively.
We expect to complete the closing of the K2 facility during the second quarter
of 2003 and the other activities were substantially completed during 2002. Of
the total $286 million restructuring charges recorded in 2002, $61 million
remains outstanding as of December 31, 2002. The outstanding liability is
principally future lease payments of which $43 million is expected to be paid
during 2003. The remaining lease payments are expected to be paid through 2007
unless the leases can be terminated earlier.
6. ACQUISITIONS IN JAPAN AND TAIWAN
In April 2002, we acquired the semiconductor packaging business of Citizen
Watch Co., Ltd. located in the Iwate prefecture in Japan. The business acquired
includes a manufacturing facility, over 80 employees and intellectual property.
The purchase price included a $78 million cash payment at closing. We are
required to make additional payments one year from closing for the amount of the
deferred purchase price as well as contingent payments. Based on the resolution
of the contingency as of January 2003, the total amount of additional payments
due in April 2003 is 17 billion Japanese yen $143 million based on the spot
exchange rate at December 31, 2002. We recorded $196 million of intangible
assets for patent rights that are amortizable over 7 years. The fair value of
the other assets acquired and liabilities assumed was approximately $25 million
for fixed assets, $01 million for inventory and other assets and $142 million
for the deferred purchase price payment and minimum amount of the contingent
payments. Such net assets principally relate to our packaging services reporting
unit.
In October 2002, we terminated negotiations with Fujitsu Limited to acquire
Fujitsu packaging and test operation in Kagoshima, Japan pursuant to the April
2002 memorandum of understanding between our company and Fujitsu.
In January 2002, we acquired Agilent Technologies, Inc. packaging
business related to semiconductor packages utilized in printers for $28 million
in  cash.  The  acquired  tangible  assets  were  integrated  into  our
62
AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
existing manufacturing facilities. The purchase price was principally allocated
to the tangible assets of our packaging services reporting unit. Our results of
operations were not significantly impacted by this acquisition.
In July 2001, we acquired, in separate transactions, 69% of Taiwan
Semiconductor Technology Corporation TSTC and 98% of Sampo Semiconductor
Corporation SSC in Taiwan. Including our prior ownership interest in TSTC,
our ownership increased to 94% of the outstanding shares of TSTC. The combined
purchase price was paid with the issuance of 49 million shares of our common
stock valued at $879 million based on our closing share price two days prior to
each acquisition, the assumption of $348 million of debt and $37 million of
cash consideration, net of acquired cash. The carrying value of our prior
investment in TSTC was $178 million. We recorded intangible assets, principally
goodwill, of $238 million as of the acquisition date that is nonamortizable. In
connection with earn-out provisions that provided for additional purchase price
based in part on the results of the acquisitions, we issued an additional 18
million shares in January 2002 and recorded an additional $352 million in
goodwill. The combined fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
was approximately $953 million for fixed assets, $395 million for accounts
receivable, inventory and other assets, $348 million of assumed debt and $101
million for other assumed liabilities. The minority interest as of the
acquisition date was $43 million. The results of TSTC and Sampo have been
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since the
acquisition dates.
In January 2001, Amkor Iwate Corporation commenced operations and acquired
from Toshiba a packaging and test facility located in the Iwate prefecture in
Japan. The total purchase price of $771 million was financed by a short-term
note payable to Toshiba of $211 million, $470 million in other financing from
a Toshiba financing affiliate and cash on hand. We currently own 60% of Amkor
Iwate and Toshiba owns the balance of the outstanding shares. By January 2004 we
are required to purchase the remaining 40% of the outstanding shares of Amkor
Iwate from Toshiba. The share purchase price will be determined based on the
performance of the joint venture during the three-year period but cannot be less
than 1 billion Japanese yen and cannot exceed 4 billion Japanese yen $84
million to $337 million based on the spot exchange rate at December 31, 2002.
The results of Amkor Iwate have been included in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements since the date of acquisition. Acquired intangibles as of
the acquisition date, based on estimates of fair value, were $214 million and
are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 5 to 10 years. Acquired
intangibles include the value of acquired technology. The combined fair value of
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was approximately $424 million for
fixed assets, $140 million for inventory and other assets, and $07 million for
assumed  liabilities. Amkor  Iwate provides packaging  and test services
principally to Toshiba Iwate factory under a long-term supply agreement that
provides for services to be performed on a cost plus basis during the term of
the joint venture and subsequently at market based rates. The supply agreement
with Toshiba Iwate factory terminates two years subsequent to our acquisition
of Toshiba ownership interest in Amkor Iwate.
7. ACQUISITIONS FROM ANAM SEMICONDUCTOR, INC. ASI AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH
ASI
ACQUISITIONS FROM AND INVESTMENT IN ANAM SEMICONDUCTOR, INC.
Historically we performed packaging and test services at our factories in
the Philippines and subcontracted for additional services with ASI, which
operated four packaging and test facilities in Korea. In the fourth quarter of
1998 ASI business had been severely affected by the economic crisis in Korea.
ASI was part of the Korean financial restructuring program known as the
Workout program beginning in October 1998. The Workout program was the result
of an accord among Korean financial institutions to assist in the restructuring
of Korean business enterprises. The process involved negotiation between ASI
banks and ASI, and did not involve the judicial system. The Workout process
restructured the terms of ASI significant bank debt. Although ASI operations
continued uninterrupted during the process, it caused concern among our
customers that we could potentially lose access to ASI services. As a result,
we decided to acquire ASI packaging and test operations to ensure continued
access to the manufacturing services previously provided by
63
AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
ASI. During the course of negotiations for the purchase of the packaging and
test operations, both ASI management and the ASI bank group presented a
counter-proposal whereby, in addition to the purchase of the packaging and test
operations, we would also make an equity investment in ASI. The bank group and
ASI management proposed this structure because they believed the equity
investment would reflect a level of commitment from us to continue our ongoing
business relationship with ASI after the sale of its packaging and test
operations to Amkor.
In May 1999, we acquired K4, one of ASI packaging and test facilities,
and in May 2000 we acquired ASI remaining packaging and test facilities, K1,
K2 and K3. With the completion of our acquisition of K1, K2 and K3, we no longer
depend upon ASI for packaging or test services. In May 2000 we committed to a
$4590 million equity investment in ASI, and fulfilled this commitment in
installments taking place over the course of 2000. In connection with the May
2000 transactions with ASI, we obtained independent appraisals to support the
value and purchase price of each the packaging and test operations and the
equity investment. We invested a total of $5006 million in ASI including an
equity investment of $416 million made in October 1999.
The acquisition of K1, K2 and K3 was accounted for as a purchase.
Accordingly, the results of K1, K2 and K3 have been included in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. Goodwill and
acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date were $5558 million and prior to
the adoption of SFAS No. 142 see Note 3 were being amortized on a
straight-line basis over a 10 year period. Acquired intangibles at the time of
the acquisition included the value of acquired patent rights and of a
workforce-in-place. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed was approximately $394 million for fixed assets, $9 million for
inventory and other assets, and $9 million for assumed liabilities.
As part of our strategy to sell our investment in ASI and to divest our
wafer fabrication services business, we entered into a series of transactions
beginning in the second half of 2002   - In September 2002, we sold 20 million shares of ASI common stock to
Dongbu Group for $581 million in net cash proceeds and 42 billion Korean
Won approximately $354 million at a spot exchange rate as of December
31, 2002 of interest bearing notes from Dongbu Corporation payable in
two equal principal payments in September 2003 and February 2004. The
Dongbu Group comprises Dongbu Corporation, Dongbu Fire Insurance Co.,
Ltd. and Dongbu Life Insurance Co., Ltd., all of which are Korean
corporations and  are collectively  referred herein  as  Dongbu.
Additionally, we divested one million shares of ASI common stock in
connection with the payment of certain advisory fees related to this
transaction.
- As of February 28, 2003, we sold our wafer fabrication services business
to ASI for total consideration of $62 million.
- In separate transactions designed to facilitate a future merger between
ASI and Dongbu, i we acquired a 10% interest in Acqutek from ASI for
$19 million; ii we acquired the Precision Machine Division PMD of
Anam Instruments, a related party to Amkor, for $8 million; and iii
Anam Instruments, which had been partially owned by ASI, utilized the
proceeds from the sale of PMD to us to buy back all of the Anam
Instruments shares owned by ASI. Acqutek supplies materials to the
semiconductor industry and is publicly traded in Korea. An entity
controlled by the family of James Kim, our Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, held a 25% ownership interest in Acqutek at the time of our
acquisition of our interest in Acqutek. We have historically purchased
and  continue to  purchase leadframes from  Acqutek. PMD supplies
sophisticated die mold systems and tooling to the semiconductor industry
and historically over 90% of its sales were to Amkor. At the time of our
acquisition of PMD, Anam Instruments was owned 20% by ASI and 20% by a
family member of James Kim.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Each of the transactions with Dongbu, ASI and Anam Instruments are
interrelated and it is possible that if each of the transactions were viewed on
a stand-alone basis without regard to the other transactions, we could have had
different conclusions as to fair value.
As of February 28, 2003, we sold our wafer fabrication services business to
ASI. Additionally, we obtained a release from Texas Instruments regarding our
contractual obligations with respect to wafer fabrication services to be
performed subsequent to the transfer of the business to ASI. Beginning with the
first quarter of 2003, we will reflect our wafer fabrication services segment as
a discontinued operation and restate our historical results. In connection with
the disposition of our wafer fabrication business, we expect to incur an
estimated $1 million in severance and other exit costs to close our wafer
fabrication services operations in Boise, Idaho and Lyon, France. We estimate
that in the first quarter of 2003 we will recognize a pre-tax net gain on the
disposition of our wafer fabrication services business approximately $58
million. The carrying value of the disposed net assets associated with the
business as of February 28, 2003 was $3 million. In addition, pursuant to the
definitive agreements, 1 Amkor and Dongbu agreed to use reasonable best
efforts to cause Dongbu Electronics and ASI to be merged together as soon as
practicable, 2 Amkor and Dongbu agreed to cause ASI to use the proceeds ASI
received from its sale of stock to Dongbu to purchase shares in Dongbu
Electronics and 3 Amkor and Dongbu agreed to use their best efforts to provide
releases and indemnifications to the chairman, directors and officers of ASI,
either past or incumbent, from any and all liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties at ASI between January 1, 1995 and December 31,
2001. The last provision would provide a release and indemnification for James
Kim, our CEO and Chairman, and members of his family. We are not aware of any
claims or other liabilities which these individuals would be released from or
for which they would receive indemnification.
OUR INVESTMENT IN ASI
We evaluate our investments for impairment due to declines in market value
that are considered other than temporary. In the event of a determination that a
decline in market value is other than temporary, a charge to earnings is
recorded for the unrealized loss, and a new cost basis in the investment is
established. The stock prices of semiconductor companies' stocks, including ASI
and its competitors, have experienced significant volatility during the past
several years. The weakness in the semiconductor industry has affected the
demand for the wafer output from ASI foundry and the market value of ASI
stock as traded on the Korea Stock Exchange. During 2002, we recorded impairment
charges totaling $1725 million to reduce the carrying value of our investment
in ASI to ASI market value. Additionally during 2002, we recorded a loss of
$18 million on the disposition of a portion of our interest in ASI to Dongbu.
At January 1, 2002 Amkor owned 477 million shares or 42% of ASI voting stock.
During 2002, we divested 21 million shares of ASI stock and at December 31, 2002
Amkor owned 267 million shares of ASI or 21%. The carrying value of our
remaining investment in ASI at December 31, 2002 was $775 million, or $290 per
share.
On March 24, 2003, we sold an additional 7 million shares of ASI common
stock to an investment bank for 244 billion Korean won $195 million based on
the spot exchange rate as of the transaction date which approximates the
carrying value of those shares. As part of that sale, we purchased a
nondeliverable call option for $67 million that expires December 2003 and is
indexed to ASI share price with a strike price of $197 per share. The net
proceeds from the exercise of the option could be less than the current carrying
value and could expire unexercised losing our entire investment in the option.
As of March 24, 2003, we owned 197 million shares of ASI, or 16% of ASI
voting stock. Beginning March 24, 2003, we ceased accounting for our investment
in ASI under the equity method of accounting and commenced accounting for our
investment as a marketable security that is available for sale.

Total stockholders'   558,730  605,616  OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ASI
We have had a long-standing relationship with ASI. ASI was founded in 1956
by Mr. H. S. Kim, the father of Mr. James Kim, our Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer. Through our supply agreements with ASI, we historically have had a
first right to substantially all of the packaging and test services capacity of
ASI and the exclusive right to all of the wafer output of ASI wafer
fabrication facility. Beginning in May 2000 with our acquisition of K1, K2 and
K3, we no longer receive packaging and test services from ASI. Under the former
wafer fabrication services supply agreement which was consummated in January
1998, we had the exclusive right but not the requirement to purchase all of the
wafer output of ASI wafer fabrication facility on pricing terms negotiated
annually. Historically, we have had other relationships with ASI affiliated
companies for financial  services, construction  services, materials  and
equipment. We believe each of these transactions was conducted on an arms-length
basis in the ordinary course of business. In addition, ASI former construction
subsidiary is currently in reorganization and its affairs are managed by a
number of creditor banks; all transactions between Amkor and this entity are
subject to review and approval by these banks. Total purchases from ASI and its
affiliates included in cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001  and 2000 were $2126 million, $1616 million and $4998 million.
Additionally, financial services performed by ASI and its affiliates included in
interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $16 million.
Construction services and equipment purchases received from ASI and its
affiliates capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000
were $28 million, $147 million and $388 million, respectively.
8. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SALE AGREEMENT
Effective July 1997 we entered into an agreement to sell receivables with
certain banks. The transaction qualified as a sale under the provisions of SFAS
No. 125 Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities. Under the agreement, the participating banks
committed to purchase, with limited recourse, all right, title and interest in
selected accounts receivable, up to a maximum of $1000 million. Losses on
receivables sold under the agreement were approximately $11 million in 2000 and
are included in other expense, net. In March 2000, we terminated the agreement
and repurchased approximately $715 million of accounts receivable.
9. INVENTORIES
Inventories, net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory of $250
million and $202 million for 2002 and 2001, respectively, consist of raw
materials and purchased components that are used in the semiconductor packaging
process.

and is a publicly traded company in Korea. An entity controlled by the family of
James Kim, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, held a 25% ownership
interest in Acqutek at the time of our acquisition of our interest in Acqutek.
We have historically purchased and continue to purchase leadframes from Acqutek.
Total purchases from Acqutek included in cost of revenue for 2002, 2001 and 2000
were $160 million, $140 million and $292 million, respectively. We believe
these transactions with Acqutek were conducted on an arms-length basis in the

In June 2002 and September 2002 we amended our existing bank debt covenants
with the secured bank lenders to provide further flexibility with respect to
capital expenditures, investment restrictions and other financial covenants
measured in part by our liquidity and earnings. As part of the September 2002
amendment, lenders under our bank debt facility agreed to extend the existing
financial covenant framework through December 31, 2003.
In March 2001, June 2001 and September 2001, we amended the financial
covenants associated with the secured credit facilities. In connection with the
September 2001 amendment, the revolving line of credit was reduced from a $200
million commitment to $100 million, the interest rate on the Term B loans was
increased to LIBOR plus 4% and we prepaid $125 million of the Term B loans in
November 2001. We expensed, as interest expense, approximately $40 million of
deferred debt issuance costs as a result of the reduction of the revolving line
of credit commitment and the prepayment of the Term B loans.
In May 2001, we sold $2500 million principal amount of our 575%
convertible subordinated notes due 2006 in a private placement. The notes are
convertible into Amkor common stock at a conversion price of $3500 per share.
We used $1220 million of the $2430 million of the net proceeds of that
offering to repay amounts outstanding under the Term B loans of our secured
credit facility, and the balance of the net proceeds was available to be used
for general corporate and working capital purposes. In connection with the
repayment in May 2001 of the Term B loans, we expensed, as interest expense 23 million of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs.
In May 2001, we called for the redemption of all of the 575% convertible
subordinated  notes due  May 2003.  In anticipation  of the redemption,
substantially all of the holders of the convertible notes opted to convert their
notes into Amkor common stock and, accordingly, $502 million of the convertible
notes were converted to 37 million of our common stock. In connection with the
conversion of the 575% convertible subordinated notes due May 2003, $12
million of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs was charged to additional
paid-in capital.

In February 2001, we sold $5000 million principal amount of our 925%
senior notes due 2008 in a private placement. We used $3875 million of the
$4900 million of the net proceeds of that offering to repay amounts outstanding
under the Term A loans and revolving line of credit of our senior secured credit
facility, and the balance of the net proceeds was available to be used for
general corporate and working capital purposes. In connection with the repayment
in February 2001 of the Term A loans, we expensed, as interest expense, $71
million of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs.
Other debt as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 included our foreign debt
principally related to the financing of Amkor Iwate acquisition of a Toshiba
packaging and test facility and the debt assumed in connection with the
acquisition of Sampo Semiconductor Corporation in Taiwan. Our foreign debt
included fixed and variable debt maturing between 2003 and 2010, with the
substantial majority maturing by 2003. As of December 31, 2002 the foreign debt
had interest rates ranging from 10% to 66%. These debt instruments do not
include significant financial covenants.
In connection with our issuance of the 575% convertible subordinated notes
due 2006 in May 2001, we incurred debt issuance costs of $70 million. In
connection with our issuance of the 925% senior notes due 2008 and the
amendment to our secured bank facility in February 2001, we incurred debt
issuance costs of $110 million. The debt issuance costs have been deferred and
are being amortized over the life of the associated debt. Deferred debt issuance
costs are included, net of amortization, in other noncurrent assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related amortization expense is
included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.
During the fourth quarter of 1999 and continuing into 2000, we completed an
early conversion of the 575% convertible subordinated notes due May 2003.
During the year ended December 31, 2000, we exchanged approximately 248,000
shares of our common stock for $32 million of the convertible subordinated
notes. During the year ended December 31, 1999, we exchanged 121 million shares
of common stock for $1536 million of convertible subordinated notes. The fair
value of the shares of common stock issued in excess of the shares required for
conversion of the notes was $03 million and $174 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and such amounts were expensed and are
included in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.
Interest expense related to short-term borrowings and long-term debt is
presented net of interest income of $42 million, $103 million and $142
million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations. The principal payments required under short-term and
long-term debt borrowings at December 31, 2002 are as follows: 2003 -- $710
million, 2004 -- $564 million, 2005 -- $424 million, 2006 -- $6779 million,
2007 -- $2596 million and thereafter -- $7014 million.
15. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
In connection with a $4100 million private equity offering in May 2000, we
issued 205 million shares of our common stock and granted warrants that expire
four years from issuance to purchase 39 million additional shares of our common
stock at $2750 per share. The estimated fair value of the stock warrants of
$350 million is included in additional paid-in capital on our consolidated

KOREAN SEVERANCE PLAN
Our Korean subsidiary participates in an accrued severance plan that covers
employees and directors with one year or more of service. Eligible plan
participants are entitled to receive a lump-sum payment upon termination of
their employment, based on their length of service and rate of pay at the time
of termination. Accrued severance benefits are estimated assuming all eligible
employees were to terminate their employment at the balance sheet date. The
contributions to the national pension fund made under the National Pension Plan
of  the Republic of Korea are  deducted from accrued severance benefit
liabilities. Contributed amounts are                                 DECEMBER 31,

Net deferred tax  $ 37,197  $109,916
During 2002, we recorded a $1382 million charge to establish a valuation
allowance against our deferred tax assets consisting primarily of U.S. and
Taiwanese net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. In connection with
our divestiture in 2002 of 21 million shares of ASI common stock, we realized a
capital loss of approximately $1170 million and recognized a U.S. tax benefit
of $445 million for which we provided a full valuation allowance because we did
not have any offsetting capital gains. Generally accepted accounting principles
require companies to weigh both positive and negative evidence in determining
the need for a valuation allowance. In light of our three years of cumulative
losses, an unprecedented industry downturn and continued poor visibility of
customer demand, we have determined, during 2002, that a valuation allowance
representing substantially all of our deferred tax assets is appropriate. These
negative factors outweighed our forecasted future profitability and expectation
that we will be able to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards.
In connection with our 2001 acquisitions in Japan and Taiwan, we recorded
as of the acquisition date a net deferred tax assets of $133 million, which is
net of a $13 million valuation allowance.
As a result of certain capital investments, export commitments and
employment levels, income from operations in Korea, the Philippines and China is
subject to reduced tax rates, and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes. As
a result of our 1999 and 2000 acquisitions of K1, K2, K3 and K4 in Korea, we
benefit from a tax holiday extending through 2012 that provides for a 100% tax
holiday for seven years and then 50                     75
AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
tax holiday for an additional 3 years. In the Philippines, our operating
locations operate in economic zones and in exchange for tax holidays we have
committed to certain export and employment levels. One of our Philippine
locations benefits from a full tax holiday through 2003, followed by perpetual
reduced tax rate of 5%, while the other location benefits from a perpetual
reduced tax rate of 5%. As a result of our 2001 investment in China, we expect
to benefit from a 100% tax holiday for five years and then 50% tax holiday for
an additional two years. As a result of the net losses incurred by our foreign
subsidiaries subject to tax holidays during 2002 and 2001, there is a forgone
income tax benefit attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries of
approximately $633 million or $0385 per share and $338 million or $021 per
share, in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The income tax benefit in 2000
attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries was approximately $434
million or $028 per share.
The deferred tax asset and liability for foreign exchange gains and losses
relate to U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities for which
foreign exchange gains or losses were realized for book purposes and not for tax
purposes. During 2000 one of our Philippine subsidiaries realized net foreign
exchange gains and losses for book purposes which were deferred for tax and
established a valuation allowance for a portion of the related deferred tax
assets. Our ability to utilize these assets depends on the timing of the
settlement of the related assets or liabilities and the amount of taxable income
recognized within the Philippine statutory carryforward limit of three years.
During 2002 and 2001, such Philippine subsidiary realized the foreign exchange
gains and losses for tax causing a reduction to the valuation allowance
established in 2000.
In December 2002, we utilized $333 million of U.S. net operating losses by
carrying back such amounts to offset U.S. reported taxable income in prior
years. At December 31, 2002, our company has remaining U.S. net operating losses
available to be carried forward totaling $3755 million expiring between 2021
and 2022. Additionally, at December 31, 2002, our company had non-U.S. net
operating losses available to be carried forward totaling $612 million expiring
between 2003 and 2012. The tax returns for open years are subject to changes
upon final examination. Non-U.S. loss before taxes and minority interest was
$3953 million and 1807 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and non-U.S.
income before taxes and minority interest was $2010 million in 2000. At
December 31, 2002, net cumulative undistributed losses of non-U.S. subsidiaries
totaled approximately $614 million. No liabilities are recognized for our
cumulative earnings loss position and no U.S. income and foreign withholding
taxes would be due on the cumulative earnings loss. It is the company
intention to reinvest any undistributed earnings outside the U.S.
At December 31, 2002 and 2001 current deferred tax assets of $55 million
and $163 million, respectively, are included in other current assets and
noncurrent deferred tax  assets of  $363 million  and $1081  million,
respectively, are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.
The net deferred tax assets include amounts, which, in our opinion, are more
likely than not to be realizable through future taxable income. In addition, at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $46 million
and $145 million, respectively, are included in other noncurrent liabilities in
the consolidated balance sheet.
We operate in and file income tax returns in various U.S. and non-U.S.
jurisdictions which are subject to examination by tax authorities. Our tax
returns have been examined through 1998 in the Philippines and the U.S., through
1999 in Japan, through 2000 in Taiwan and through 2001 in China. The tax returns
for open years in all jurisdictions in which we do business are subject to
changes upon examination. We believe that we have estimated and provided
adequate accruals for the probable additional taxes and related interest expense
that may ultimately result from examinations related to our transfer pricing and
local  attribution  of  income  resulting  from  significant intercompany
transactions, including ownership and use of intellectual property, in various
U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. Our estimated tax liability is subject to
change as examinations of specific tax years are completed in the respective
jurisdictions. We believe that any additional taxes or related interest over the
amounts accrued will not have a material effect on our financial condition or
results of operations, nor do we expect that examinations to be completed in the
near term would have a material favorable impact. As of December 31, 2002 and
2001,  the  accrual  for  current  taxes  and  estimated  additional
76

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
taxes was $488 million and $534 million, respectively. In addition, changes in
the mix of income from our foreign subsidiaries, expiration of tax holidays and
changes in tax laws or regulations could result in increased effective tax rates
in the future.
18. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per
Share, requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share on
the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed using only the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the period, while diluted EPS is
computed assuming conversion of all dilutive securities, such as options,
convertible debt and warrants. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001,
we excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share potentially
dilutive securities which would have an antidilutive effect on EPS. As of
December  31, 2002, the total number of potentially dilutive securities
outstanding was 66 million, 117 million and 39 million for outstanding
options, convertible notes and warrants for common stock, respectively. As of
December 31, 2001, the total number of potentially dilutive  securities
outstanding was 124 million, 117 million and 39 million for outstanding
options, convertible notes and warrants for common stock, respectively. The
basic and diluted per share amounts are the same for the years 2002 and 2001,
due to net losses.
Year 2000 basic and diluted per share amounts are calculated as follows                                       WEIGHTED

19. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS
1998 Director Option Plan. A total of 300,000 shares of common stock have
been reserved for issuance under the Director Plan. The option grants under the
Director Plan are automatic and non-discretionary. As of January 1, 2003, the
Director Plan provides for an initial grant of options to purchase 20,000 shares
of common stock to each new non-employee director of the company when such
individual first becomes an outside director. In addition, each non-employee
director will automatically be granted subsequent options to purchase 10,000
shares of common stock on each date on which such director is re-elected by the
stockholders of the company, provided that as of such date such director has
served on the board of directors for at least six months. The exercise price of
the options is 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant
date. The term of each option is ten years and each option granted to an
non-employee director vests over a three year period. The Director Plan will
terminate in January 2008 unless sooner terminated by the board of directors.
1998 Stock Plan. The 1998 Stock Plan generally provides for the grant to
employees, directors and consultants of stock options and stock purchase rights.
Unless terminated sooner, the 1998 Plan will terminate automatically in January
2008. A total of 5,000,000 shares are reserved for issuance under the 1998 Stock
Plan, and there is a provision for an annual replenishment to bring the number
of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plan up to 5,000,000
as of each January 1.
Unless determined otherwise by the board of directors or a committee
appointed by the board of directors, options and stock purchase rights granted
under  the  1998  Plan  are  not  transferable  by  the  optionee.

AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Generally, the exercise price of all stock options granted under the 1998 Plan
must be at least equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of
grant. In general, the options granted will vest over a four year period and the
term of the options granted under the 1998 Plan may not exceed ten years.
1998 Stock Option Plan for French Employees.  The 1998 French Plan will
terminate in April 2003. Amkor intends to implement a new French Plan, subject
to shareholder approval, in 2003. The 1998 French Plan provides for the granting
of options to employees of our French subsidiaries. A total of 250,000 shares of
common stock are reserved for issuance under the 1998 French Plan, and there is
a provision for an annual replenishment to bring the number of shares of common
stock reserved for issuance under the plan up to 250,000 as of each January 1.
In general, stock options granted under the 1998 French Plan vest over a four
year period, the exercise price for each option granted under the 1998 French
Plan shall be 100% of the fair market value of the shares of common stock on the
date the option is granted and the maximum term of the option must not exceed
ten years. Shares subject to the options granted under the 1998 French Plan may
not be transferred, assigned or hypothecated in any manner other than by will or
the laws of descent or distribution before the date which is five years after
the date of grant.
On November 8, 2002, we initiated a voluntary stock option replacement
program such that employees and members of our board of directors could elect to
surrender their existing options and be granted new options no earlier than six
months and one day after the tendered options were cancelled. We will issue new
option grants equal to the same number of shares surrendered by the employees.
Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the offer to exchange, a total of 1,633
eligible employees participated and our company has accepted for cancellation
options to purchase an aggregate of 7,115,891 shares of our company common
stock under the 1998 Stock Plan, an aggregate of 35,000 shares of our company
common stock under the 1998 Director Option Plan and an aggregate of 248,200
shares of our company common stock under the 1998 French Plan. Subject to the
terms and conditions of the offer to exchange, our company intends to grant new
options to purchase up to 7,399,091 shares of our common stock no earlier than
June 12, 2003 in exchange for the options tendered by eligible employees and
members of our board of directors and accepted by our company. The exercise
price will equal the fair market value of common stock as of the new grant date.
The vesting term of the new options will be similar to the tendered options
except the new options contain an additional one year vesting period prior to
any options becoming exercisable.

In order to calculate the fair value of stock options at date of grant, we

stock are available for sale under the Stock Purchase Plan and an annual
increase is to be added as of each January 1 to restore the maximum aggregate
number of shares of common stock available for sale under the plan up to
1,000,000. Employees including officers and employee directors of the company
but excluding 5% or greater stockholders are eligible to participate if they
are customarily employed for at least 20 hours per week. The Stock Purchase Plan
permits eligible employees to purchase common stock through payroll deductions,
which may not exceed 15% of the compensation an employee receives on each
payday. Each participant will be granted an option on the first day of a two
year offering period, and shares of common stock will be purchased on four
purchase dates within the offering period. The purchase price of the common
stock under the Stock Purchase Plan will be equal to 85% of the lesser of the
fair market value per share of common stock on the start date of the offering
period or on the purchase date. Employees may end their participation in an
offering period at any time, and participation ends automatically on termination
of employment with the company. The Stock Purchase Plan will terminate in
January 2008, unless sooner terminated by the board of directors.
For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, employees purchased
common stock shares under the stock purchase plan of 996,617, 482,937 and
263,498, respectively. The average estimated fair values of the purchase rights
granted during the years ended December 31 2002, 2001 and 2000 based on the
Black-Scholes option pricing model were $316, $653 and $1217, respectively.

The estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined using
available  market  information  and  appropriate  methodologies;  however,
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the
estimates for fair value. Accordingly, these estimates are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange.
Certain of these financial instruments are with major financial institutions and
expose us to market and credit risks and may at times be concentrated with
certain counterparties or groups of counterparties. The creditworthiness of
counterparties is continually reviewed, and full performance is anticipated.
The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for  short-term
investments, due from affiliates, other accounts receivable, due to affiliates,
accrued expenses and  accrued income taxes  approximate fair value  due

AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
to the short-term nature of these instruments. The methods and assumptions used
to estimate the fair value of other significant classes of financial instruments
is set forth below   Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are due on demand or
carry a maturity date of less than three months when purchased. The carrying
amount of these financial instruments is a reasonable estimate of fair value.
Available for sale investments.  The fair value of these financial
instruments was estimated based on market quotes, recent offerings of similar
securities, current and projected financial performance of the company and net
asset positions.
Long-term debt.  The carrying amount of our total long-term debt as
December 31, 2002 was $1,7377 million and the fair value based on available
market quotes is estimated to be $1,3213 million.

2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. We lease office space in West Chester,
Pennsylvania from certain of our stockholders. The lease expires in 2006. We
have the option to extend the lease for an additional 10 years through 2016.
Amounts paid for this lease in each of 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $12 million.
Indemnifications and Guarantees
In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN No. 45, Guarantor Accounting and
Disclosure  requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others. We have adopted the disclosure requirements of the
Interpretation as of December 31, 2002. Disclosures about our indemnifications
and guarantees are provided below.
We have indemnified members of our board of directors and our corporate
officers collectively, the Indemnitees against any threatened, pending or
completed action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a director or
officer of the company. The Indemnitees are indemnified, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, against related expenses, judgments, fines and any amounts
paid in settlement. The maximum amount of future payments is generally
unlimited. There is no amount recorded for this indemnification at December 31,
2002. Due to the nature of

AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
this indemnification, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the
maximum potential loss or range of loss. No assets are held as collateral and no
specific recourse provisions exist related to this indemnification.
In connection with the termination of AEI status as an S Corporation see
Note 1, Receivable from Stockholder, in 1998 we indemnified and agreed to hold
harmless the Kim family against any U.S. federal or state income tax liability
resulting from the Kim family being required to include in income amounts in
excess of the income shown to be reportable on the original tax returns filed,
as they relate to the previously existing S Corporation. The carrying amount
recorded for this indemnification as of December 31, 2002 is $150 million. It
is reasonably possible that future payments may exceed amounts accrued. The
maximum potential loss related to this indemnification is $233 million. No
assets are held as collateral and no specific recourse provisions exist.
As of December 31, 2002, we have outstanding $10 million of standby
letters of credit. Such standby letters of credit are used in our ordinary
course of business and are collateralized by our cash balances.
22. SEGMENT INFORMATION
In accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, we had two reportable segments, packaging
and test services and wafer fabrication services. These segments were managed
separately because the services provided by each segment required different
technology and marketing strategies.
Packaging and Test Services.  Through our factories located in the
Philippines, Korea, Japan, Taiwan and China, we offer a complete and integrated
set of packaging and test services including integrated circuit IC packaging
design, leadframe and substrate design, IC package assembly, final testing,
burn-in, reliability testing and thermal and electrical characterization.
Wafer Fabrication Services.  Through our wafer fabrication services
division, we provided marketing, engineering and support services for ASI
wafer foundry, under a long-term supply agreement. As of February 28, 2003, we
sold our wafer fabrication services business to ASI. Beginning with the first
quarter of 2003, we will reflect our wafer fabrication services segment as a
discontinued operation and restate our historical results.
Prior to the sale of our wafer fabrication services business to ASI in
February 2003, we derived 928%, 794% and 807% of our wafer fabrication
revenues from Texas Instruments TI for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Effective as of February 28, 2003, we obtained a release from Texas Instruments
regarding our contractual obligations with respect to wafer fabrication services
to be performed subsequent to the transfer of the business to ASI. Total net
revenues derived from TI accounted for 139%, 102% and 141% of consolidated
net revenues in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. With the commencement of
operations of Amkor Iwate and the acquisition of a packaging and test facility
from Toshiba in 2001, total net revenues derived from Toshiba accounted for
126% and 143% of our consolidated  net revenues for 2002 and  2001,
respectively.
The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as those for our
consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our operating segments based on
operating income. Summarized  financial information concerning  reportable
segments is shown in the following table. The Other column includes the
