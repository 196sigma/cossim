Stockholders of PC Mall, Inc. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of PC Mall, Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company at December31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for
vendor consideration as of January1, 2003. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Los Angeles, California March24, 2006

PC MALL, INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Description of Company PC Mall, Inc., together
with its wholly-owned subsidiaries collectively referred to as we or us, founded in 1987, is a rapid response direct marketer of computer hardware, software, peripheral, electronics, and other consumer products and
services. We offer products and services to businesses, government and educational institutions, as well as individual consumers, through dedicated outbound and inbound telemarketing account executives, the Internet, direct marketing techniques,
direct response catalogs, a direct sales force and three retail showrooms. We offer a broad selection of products through our distinctive full-color catalogs under the PC Mall, MacMall, ClubMac and PC Mall Gov brands, our websites pcmall.com,
macmall.com, clubmac.com, pcmallgov.com and onsale.com, and other promotional materials. On April11, 2005, we completed the spin-off
of our 802% owned subsidiary, eCOST.com, Inc. eCOST.com when we distributed approximately 12071 shares of eCOST.com common stock as a special dividend on each outstanding share of our common stock to our stockholders of record on
March28, 2005. As a result of the spin-off, eCOST.com, which was a segment of our company, is presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented herein. See Note 3 below for more information on the discontinued operation of
eCOST.com. We operate in two reportable segments: 1a rapid response supplier of technology solutions for businesses, government
and educational institutions, as well as consumers, collectively referred to as Core business and 2an online retailer of computer and consumer electronic products under the OnSale.com brand. Beginning in the first quarter of
2003, we integrated our former eLinux segment into the Core business segment. Also, beginning in the third quarter of 2003, the OnSale.com segment, which was previously reported as part of the Core business, was established as a new segment. Prior
period segment amounts have been reclassified to reflect the new segment presentation. We allocate our resources to and evaluate the performance of our segments based on operating income. Corporate expenses are included in our measure of segment
operating income for management reporting purposes. 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The accompanying
financial statements included herein are presented on a consolidated basis and include our accounts and accounts of our subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. We allocate earnings and losses to minority interests
only to the extent of a minority investors investment in a subsidiary. Use of Estimates in the Preparation of the Consolidated Financial
Statements We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, which requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported herein. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications
have been made to the 2004 and 2003 financial statement amounts to conform to the 2005 presentation. 
51 Table of Contents
Revised Presentation of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005, we have revised the presentation of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for all periods presented to
separately disclose the operating, investing and financing portions of the cash flows attributable to the discontinued operation of eCOST.com, which we spun-off in April 2005. We had previously reported these amounts on a combined basis in our
quarterly financial statements in 2005. Revenue Recognition We adhere to the revised guidelines and principles of sales recognition described in Staff Accounting Bulletin No104, Revenue Recognition SAB 104, issued by the staff of the Securities
and Exchange Commission the SEC as a revision to Staff Accounting Bulletin No101, Revenue Recognition SAB 101. While the wording of SAB 104 has revised the original SAB 101, Revenue
Recognition, the revenue recognition principles of SAB 101 remain largely unchanged by the issuance of SAB 104. Under SAB 104, sales are recognized when the title and risk of loss are passed to the customer, there is persuasive evidence of an
arrangement for sale, delivery has occurred and/or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Under these guidelines, the majority of our sales, including revenue from product
sales and gross outbound shipping and handling charges, are recognized upon receipt of the product by the customer. In accordance with our revenue recognition policy, we perform an analysis to estimate the number of days products we have shipped are
in transit to our customers using data from our third party carriers and other factors. We record an adjustment to reverse the impact of the sale transactions based on the estimated value of products that have shipped, but have not yet been received
by our customers, and we adjust such amounts in the subsequent period when delivery has occurred. For all product sales shipped directly
from suppliers to customers, we take title to the products sold upon shipment, bear credit risk, and bear inventory risk for returned products that are not successfully returned to suppliers; therefore, these revenues are recognized at gross sales
amounts. Certain software products, extended warranties and certain other products and services that we sell for which we are not the
primary obligor are recognized on a net basis in accordance with SAB 101 and Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent. Accordingly, such revenues
are recognized in net sales either at the time of sale or over the contract period, based on the nature of the contract, at the net amount retained by us, with no cost of goods sold. Sales are reported net of estimated returns and allowances, discounts, mail-in rebate redemptions and credit card chargebacks. If actual sales returns,
allowances, discounts, mail-in rebate redemptions and/or credit card chargebacks are greater than estimated by management, additional expense may be incurred. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold includes product costs and outbound and inbound shipping costs, offset by
certain market development funds and other vendor consideration from vendors included in our catalogs, as described in Advertising Costs and Vendor Consideration below. Cash and Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three
months or less are considered cash equivalents. Our cash management programs result in utilizing available cash to pay down our line of credit. Checks issued but not presented for payment to the bank totaling $148 million and $105 million as of
December31, 2005 and 2004 were included in Accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
52 Table of Contents
Accounts Receivable We generate the majority of our accounts receivable through the sale of products to certain customers on account. In addition, we record vendor receivables at such time as all conditions have been met that would
entitle us to receive such vendor funding, and is thereby considered fully earned. The following table presents the gross amounts of trade
receivables for sales to customers on account and other receivables, which include all other types of receivables, mainly vendor receivables in thousands:  December31 2005 2004 Trade receivables 93,168 80,116 Other receivables 14,587 15,123 Total gross accounts receivable 107,755 95,239 Less: Allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 4,774 2,846 Accounts receivable, net 102,981 92,393 We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based upon estimates of future
collection. We extend credit to our customers based upon an evaluation of each customers financial condition and credit history, and generally do not require collateral. We regularly evaluate our customers financial condition and credit
history in determining the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts. We also maintain an allowance for uncollectible vendor receivables, which arise from vendor rebate programs, price protections and other promotions. We determine the
sufficiency of the vendor receivable allowance based upon various factors, including payment history. Amounts received from vendors may vary from amounts recorded because of potential non-compliance with certain elements of vendor programs. If
estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts or vendor receivables subsequently prove insufficient, additional allowances may be required. Concentration of Credit Risk Accounts receivable potentially subject us to credit risk. We extend credit to our
customers based upon an evaluation of each customers financial condition and credit history and generally do not require collateral. We have historically incurred credit losses within managements expectations. No customer accounted for
more than 10% of trade accounts receivable at December31, 2005 and 2004. Inventories Inventories consist primarily of finished goods, and are stated at cost determined under the first-in, first-out method or market, whichever is lower.
At December31, 2005 and 2004, we had reserves of $22 million and $20 million, reflecting lower of cost or market pricing and potential excess and obsolete inventory for demonstration purposes. As discussed under Revenue
Recognition above, we do not record revenue and related cost of goods sold until delivery has occurred. As such, inventories include goods-in-transit to customers at December31, 2005 and 2004. Advertising Costs and Vendor Consideration We
account for advertising costs in accordance with Statement of Position SOP No93-7, Reporting on Advertising Costs. We produce and circulate direct response catalogs at various dates throughout the year. The costs of
developing, producing and circulating each direct response catalog are deferred and amortized to advertising expense based on the life of the catalog, which is approximately eight weeks. Other non-catalog 
53 Table of Contents
advertising expenditures are expensed in the period incurred. Total net advertising expenditures, which are included in Selling, general and
administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, were $156 million in 2005, compared to $190 million in 2004 and $201 million in 2003. Deferred advertising costs, which are included in Prepaid expenses and other
current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $11million and $16 million at December31, 2005 and 2004. As we
circulate catalogs throughout the year, we receive market development funds and other vendor consideration from vendors included in each catalog. These funds are deferred and recognized based on sales generated over the life of the catalog. We also
receive other non-catalog related vendor consideration from our vendors in the form of cooperative marketing allowances, volume incentive rebate programs and other programs to support our marketing of their products. Most of our vendor consideration
is recorded as an offset to cost of sales in accordance with EITF 02-16, Accounting by a Customer Including a Reseller for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor EITF 02-16 since such funds are not a reimbursement
of specific, incremental, identifiable costs incurred by us in selling the vendors products. We adopted EITF 02-16 on January1, 2003, which requires, under certain circumstances, that vendor considerations received be recorded as a
reduction of cost of sales rather than as an offset to selling, general and administrative expenses. This resulted in a significant change in our reported net advertising expense and cost of goods sold for 2003, the year of adopting EITF 02-16
compared to prior years. The adoption of EITF 02-16 in 2003 resulted in approximately $200 million of vendor consideration being recorded against cost of sales, which was previously recorded as an offset to selling, general and administrative
expenses in prior years. Deferred vendor consideration is included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as noted below. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their useful lives or theremaining lease term. We also capitalize computer software costs that
meet both the definition of internal-use software and defined criteria for capitalization in accordance with SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.  Computers, software, machinery and equipment
35years
Leasehold improvements
110years
Furniture and fixtures
315years
Building and improvements
531years
We had $20 and $23 million of unamortized internally developed software at December31,
2005 and 2004. In December 2004, we recorded a charge of approximately $06 million to Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations relating to an impairment of previously capitalized
internally developed software. Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities
approximate their fair values because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amounts of our line of credit borrowings and notes payable approximate their fair values based upon the current rates offered to us for obligations
of similar terms and remaining maturities. Goodwill Prior to January1, 2002, goodwill resulting from acquisitions was amortized using the straight-line method over periods not exceeding twenty-five years and was subject to periodic review for impairment.
Effective January1, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142, Goodwill and 
54 Table of Contents
Other Intangible Assets and ceased amortization of goodwill. Under SFAS 142, goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a
reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, including consideration of our market capitalization. We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year, using the present value of expected future cash flows
and other techniques for determining fair value. Changes in estimates of future cash flows or changes in market values could result in a write-down of our goodwill in a future period. If an impairment loss results from the annual impairment test,
such loss will be recorded as a pre-tax charge to operating income. In April 2002, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Pacific
Business Systems, Inc. PBS, a privately held direct marketer of computer products to business and consumer customers under the ClubMac brand. We operate the acquired business as ClubMac and consider this business to be a part of our
Core business segment defined in Note 12. Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, we acquired PBS customer database, accounts receivable, inventory, certain fixed assets and certain intellectual property and assumed certain
liabilities equal to the negotiated values of acquired accounts receivable and inventory. In addition to certain liabilities assumed, we issued 300,000 shares of our common stock valued at approximately $13 million to PBS and agreed to a capped
three-year earn-out, whereby additional consideration was paid to PBS based on the future results of the acquired business. During 2004, we recorded $05 million of additional purchase price consideration resulting from the earn-out provision and
none in 2005. The change in the carrying amounts of goodwill, all of which is held at the Core business segment, was as follows in thousands:  Goodwill
Balance at December31, 2003 861
Additional consideration pursuant to earn-out provision 544 Balance at December31, 2004 1,405
Activity Balance at December31, 2005 1,405 We performed our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2005. The estimated
fair value of our Core business segment exceeded its net carrying value, and as such, we determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of December31, 2005. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets We review long-lived assets and certain intangible assets for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In the event the undiscounted future cash flow attributable to the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment
loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Changes in estimates of future cash flows attributable to the long-lived assets could result in a write-down of the asset in a future
period. Debt Issuance Costs We
defer costs incurred to obtain our credit facility and amortize these costs to interest expense using the straight-line method over the term of the respective obligation. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the liability method as prescribed in
accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the tax basis
and financial reporting amounts of existing assets and liabilities. We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax provisions and benefits, in assessing the likelihood of recovering our deferred tax assets and in evaluating our
tax 
55 Table of Contents
positions. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. See Note 6
for more detailed information. Stock-Based Compensation We have adopted the provisions of SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure SFAS 148, which amends SFAS No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123. As permitted by SFAS 148, we continue to measure compensation cost in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
APB 25 and related interpretations, and provide pro forma disclosures of net income loss and earnings loss per share as if the fair-value method had been applied. Accordingly, we do not record compensation expense on issuance of
stock options to employees as all options issued to employees to date were granted at the then-current market value at the date of grant. SFAS 123 Pro Forma Information The following table presents the effect on Income loss from continuing
operations of recognizing stock-based compensation cost as if the fair value based method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested stock options as of the periods presented in thousands, except per share amounts:  December31 2005 2004 2003 Income loss from continuing operations as reported 1,932 1,478 2,559 Less stock compensation expense, net of taxes, determined under the fair value based method 1,966 1,735 1,082 Add stock compensation expense, net of taxes, included in reported income loss from continuing operations 191 Income loss from continuing operations pro forma 3,898 257 1,668 Basic and diluted earnings loss from continuing operations per common share Basic as reported 017 013 024 Basic pro forma 033 002 016 Diluted as reported 017 012 022 Diluted pro forma 033 002 014

Translation. Assets and liabilities of our Canadian and Philippine subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate
for each month within the year. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded directly in other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. All transaction gains or losses are
recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These gains or losses were not material in any of the years presented in our consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No154,
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections SFAS 154. SFAS 154 replaces APB No20, Accounting Changes APB 20 and SFAS No3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
Statements, and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. Under APB 20, a change in accounting principle was recognized as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the income
statement of the period of the change. SFAS 154 generally requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principles. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of
errors made in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of
FASB Statement No143 FIN 47. FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability, when incurred, for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset-retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the
fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of the fiscal year ending after December15, 2005. We have adopted FIN 47 as of the end of our fiscal year ended December31, 2005. The
adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In December
2004, the FASB issued SFAS No153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets an amendment of APB Opinion No29 SFAS 153. SFAS 153 eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets of
APB Opinion No29 and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change
significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2005. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated
results of operations or financial position. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No151, Inventory Costs an
amendment of ARB No43, Chapter 4 SFAS 151. SFAS 151 amends Accounting Research Bulletin No43, Chapter 4, Inventory 
57 Table of Contents
Pricing ARB 43 to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, double freight, rehandling costs and wasted
material. SFAS 151 requires that these types of costs be recognized as current period expenses regardless of whether they meet the criteria of so abnormal as previously provided in ARB 43. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation
of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005. We do not expect the
adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In December 2004,
the FASB issued SFAS No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for
either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. The statement eliminates the ability to
account for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by APB 25, and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses in our Consolidated
Statements of Operations. The statement requires companies to assess the most appropriate model to calculate the value of the options. We currently use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value options and we are currently assessing which
model will be used in the future under the new statement and may deem an alternative model to be the most appropriate. The use of a different model to value options may result in a different fair value than the use of the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. In addition, there are a number of other requirements under the new standard that will result in differing accounting treatment than currently required. These differences include, but are not limited to, the accounting for the tax
benefit on employee stock options. In addition to the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share-based payments, we will also be required to determine the transition method to be used at the date of adoption. The allowed transition
methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options. Under the retroactive options, prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented. The prospective method requires that
compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of SFAS 123R, while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and
restricted stock beginning with the first period restated. The SEC extended the implementation date of SFAS 123R such that the effective date of the new standard for our financial statements is the first fiscal quarter of 2006. We have determined
that we will adopt the modified prospective method provided by SFAS 123R. However, we have not yet determined the impact of adopting SFAS 123R on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. 3. Discontinued Operation On September1, 2004,
eCOST.com completed the sale of 3,465,000 shares of its common stock for an aggregate consideration of $201 million, less underwriting discounts and commissions of $14 million the IPO. eCOST.com incurred approximately $20 million of
offering expenses in connection with the offering. In connection with the IPO, eCOST.com paid a dividend of $25 million to us through a non-cash settlement of the capital contribution due from us outstanding at the completion of the IPO. Following
the IPO, we owned 802% of the outstanding common stock of eCOST.com. At the date of the IPO, we recorded a minority interest liability of
$45 million representing the 198% interest in eCOST.coms stockholders equity immediately following the IPO. The liability was offset by a corresponding reduction of additional paid-in-capital. Further, this liability was reduced by the
198% portion of eCOST.coms net loss between the completion of the IPO date and the end of the fourth quarter of 2004, totaling $02 million. On April11, 2005, we completed the spin-off of eCOST.com, Inc. by distributing our 802% ownership interest in eCOST.com to our stockholders. We distributed approximately 12071 shares of eCOST.com common stock as a special dividend
on each outstanding share of our common stock to our stockholders of record on 
58 Table of Contents
March28, 2005. As a result, we distributed to our stockholders an aggregate of 14,000,000 shares of eCOST.com common stock, which had an aggregate
market value of approximately $903 million based on the last sale price for eCOST.com common stock on the NASDAQ National Market on April11, 2005. The financial results of eCOST.com, which were historically reported as an operating segment, have been excluded from our results from continuing operations for all periods presented herein and have been presented as
a discontinued operation. eCOST.coms revenues, operating and non-operating results for all periods prior to April12, 2005 are reflected in a single line item entitled Income loss from discontinued operation, net of taxes on
our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and eCOST.coms assets and liabilities are presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in line items entitled Current assets of discontinued operation, Non-current assets of
discontinued operation and Current liabilities of discontinued operation as of December31, 2004. Cash flows resulting from the discontinued operations of eCOST.com have been presented separately from cash flows resulting from
our continuing operations. See Revised Presentation of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Note 2 for more information. The carrying amounts of major classes of eCOST.coms assets and liabilities that have been included in such balance sheet line items, as described above, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December31, 2004 were as follows

We entered into a Tax Allocation and Indemnification Agreement with eCOST.com, which governs the
respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of eCOST.com and us after eCOST.coms IPO with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other matters regarding income taxes, non-income taxes and related tax
returns. In general, under the Tax Allocation and Indemnification Agreement, among others, we are responsible for any U.S. federal, state or local income taxes that are determined on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis on a return that
includes us and/or one or more of our subsidiaries, on the one hand, and eCOST.com and/or one or more of its subsidiaries, on the other hand. However, in the event that eCOST.com or one of its subsidiaries are included in such a return for a
period, or portion thereof, beginning after the date of eCOST.coms IPO, eCOST.com is responsible for its portion of the income tax liability in respect of the period as if eCOST.com and its subsidiaries had filed a separate tax return that
included only eCOST.com and its subsidiaries for that period, or portion thereof. As a result of eCOST.com being included in our
consolidated federal income tax return until completion of its spin-off from us, losses incurred by eCOST.com prior to its spin-off are reduced by any of our profits for 2005. Any remaining unused operating loss allocable to eCOST.com under federal
tax law will carry forward to eCOST.coms separate federal income tax returns and will be available to offset eCOST.coms operating profits earned as a stand-alone company beginning in 2006. Under the Tax Allocation and Indemnification
Agreement, eCOST.com is not allocated any remaining unused operating loss under state or local law unless required under applicable state or local law. 4. Property and Equipment Property and equipment consist of the following as of December31 in thousands:
2005 2004 Computers, software, machinery and equipment 27,031 24,800 Leasehold improvements 4,057 3,985 Furniture and fixtures 3,484 3,435 Building and improvements 1,725 1,725 Land 912 912 Software development in progress 749 793 Subtotal 37,958 35,650 Less: Accumulated depreciation and amortization 29,542 26,599 Property and equipment, net 8,416 9,051 Depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment for the years ended
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled $38 million, $39 million and $35 million. 5. Line of Credit and Note Payable We maintain an asset-based revolving credit facility from a lending unit of a large commercial bank that commenced in March 2001. In March 2003, the
credit facility was amended to extend the term by an additional three years to expire in March 2007, and obtain improved terms. In September 2005, the credit facility was amended to, among other things, increase the total line of credit from $750
million to $1000 million and the maturity date of the facility was extended from March 2007 to March 2008. The agreement is substantially the same as our previous agreement, but has the following additional material provision changes: credit card
receivables are included in the borrowing base up to $75 million; receivables of up to $50 million from our former subsidiary, eCOST.com, are included in the borrowing base; and the unused line fee provisions were amended to provide that the
existing unused line fee of 025%per annum will be assessed on the unused portion of the credit facility up to $600 million, unless the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility exceed $750million, at which time the unused line
fees will be assessed on the unused portion of the facility up to $800million. The amended agreement also included a line increase fee of $62,500, a syndication fee of $25,000 
60 Table of Contents
and an extension fee of $100,000, which we deferred included in Other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and began amortizing over the
remaining modified term of the agreement beginning in the third quarter of 2005. The credit facility functions as a working capital line
of credit with a borrowing base of inventory and accounts receivable, including certain credit card receivables, and bears interest at the prime rate or an option to select the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus a spread of 20%
or 225%, depending on certain earnings targets. At December31, 2005, the prime rate was 70%, our effective LIBOR option was 635% and we had $535 million of net working capital advances outstanding under the line of credit. At
December31, 2005, we had $261 million available to borrow for working capital advances under the line of credit. The credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets. In addition to the security interest required by the credit
facility, certain of our vendors have security interest in some of our assets related to their products. The credit facility has as its single financial covenant a minimum tangible net worth requirement, which we were in compliance with at
December31, 2005. In February 2005, we terminated a flooring credit facility, which functioned in lieu of a vendor trade payable for
inventory purchases and did not bear interest if paid within terms specific to each vendor. We did not draw any substantial amounts on the flooring credit facility during 2005, 2004 and 2003. In connection with and as a part of the line of credit, we entered into a term note. In May 2004, we amended the term note to increase the borrowing base
from $20 million to $35 million and extend the maturity date from March 2005 to September 2011. As of December31, 2005, we had borrowed $35 million under the term note, payable in equal monthly principal installments, plus interest at the
prime rate with a LIBOR option. At December31, 2005, we had $275 million outstanding under the term note. Our term note matures as follows: $500,000 annually in each of the years 2006 through 2010 and $250,000 thereafter. 6. Income Taxes Our income tax expense benefit
consisted of the following for the years ended December31 in thousands:  2005 2004

The significant components of deferred tax assets were as follows at December31 in thousands:
2005 2004 Accounts receivable 1,834 1,084 Inventories 751 790 Property and equipment 1,026 530 Amortization 2,411 2,717 Accrued expenses and reserves 999 1,224 Tax credits and loss carryforwards 5,446 4,514 Other 49 21 Total 12,418 10,838 The exercise of stock options resulted in a tax benefit that has been reflected as a reduction of
taxes payable, an increase to deferred tax assets and an increase to additional paid-in capital. The benefit recorded to additional paid-in capital was $03 million, $38 million and $08 million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and
2003. We entered into a Tax Allocation and Indemnification Agreement with eCOST.com, which governs the respective rights, responsibilities
and obligations of eCOST.com and us after eCOST.coms IPO in September 2004. As part of this agreement, any remaining unused operating loss allocable to eCOST.com under federal tax law will carry forward to eCOST.coms separate federal
income tax returns and will be available to offset eCOST.coms operating profits earned as a stand-alone company beginning in 2006. Under the Tax Allocation and Indemnification Agreement, eCOST.com is not allocated any remaining unused
operating loss under state or local law unless required under applicable state or local law. See Note 3 for a detailed discussion of this agreement. At December31, 2005, we had, net of unused operating loss allocated to eCOST.com as described above, state net operating loss carryforwards of $162 million, which begin to expire at the end of 2006, and federal
net operating loss carryforwards of $134 million, which begin to expire at the end of 2019. At December31, 2005, we had federal minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately $52,000 which do not expire. We account for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates
applicable to future years to differences between the tax bases and financial reporting amounts of existing assets and liabilities. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon sufficient taxable income within the carryback years and the generation of future taxable income during the
periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers taxable income in carryback years, if carryback is permitted in the tax law, the projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this
assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and the projections for future taxable income over the periods when the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize all of
these deductible differences. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward periods are reduced.

7. Commitments and Contingencies Commitments We lease office and warehouse space and equipment under various non-cancelable operating
leases which provide for minimum annual rentals and escalations based on increases in real estate taxes and other operating expenses. We also have minimum commitments under non-cancelable contracts for services relating to telecommunications, IT
maintenance, financial services and material employment contracts with certain executive and senior management which consist of severance arrangements that, if exercised, would become payable in less than one year. As of December31, 2005,
minimum payments over the terms of applicable contracts were payable as follows in thousands:  2006

income, totaled $40 million, $39 million and $35 million. Some of the leases contain renewal options and escalation clauses, and require us to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Legal Proceedings Various claims and actions,
considered normal to our business, have been asserted and are pending against us. As of December31, 2005, we do not believe that any such claims and actions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Litigation, however,
involves uncertainties, and it is possible that the eventual outcome of litigation could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations or financial position for a particular period. See Note 14 for a discussion of a purported class action lawsuit that was filed on February3, 2006 against us. 8. Stockholders Equity In July 1996, we
announced a plan to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of our common stock. The shares may be repurchased from time to time at prevailing market prices, through open market or negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions. No limit was
placed on the duration of the repurchase program. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that we will repurchase. Subject to applicable securities laws, repurchases may be made at such times and in such amounts as our management
deems appropriate. The program can also be discontinued at any time management determines additional purchases are not warranted. We will finance the repurchase plan with existing working capital. As of December31, 2005, we have repurchased a
cumulative total of 294,200 shares, which includes 254,200 shares repurchased under the program. We have not repurchased any shares of our common stock during 2005 or 2004. 9. Earnings Loss Per Common Share Basic earnings loss per share EPS excludes
dilution and is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reported periods. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur under the treasury stock method if stock
options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised, except in loss periods where the effect would be antidilutive. Potential common shares of 1,250,823, 38,773 and 323,170 for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003
have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because the effect of their inclusion would be antidilutive.

Employee Benefits 401k Savings Plan We maintain a 401k Savings Plan which covers substantially all full-time employees who meet the
plans eligibility requirements. Participants are allowed to make tax-deferred contributions up to limitations specified by the Internal Revenue Code. We made a 25% matching contribution for amounts that did not exceed 4% of the
participants annual compensation until March31, 2004, at which time we terminated the matching provision. During 2004 and 2003, we incurred approximately $42,000 and $188,000 of expenses related to the 401k matching component of this
plan. 1994 Stock Incentive Plan In
November 1994, our Board of Directors and stockholders approved the 1994 Stock Incentive Plan the 1994 Plan, which provides for the grant of stock options to our employees and consultants. Under the 1994 Plan, we may grant options
Incentive Stock Options within the meaning of Section422A of the Internal Revenue Code, or options not intended to qualify as Incentive Stock Options Nonstatutory Stock Options. In May 2000, our Board of Directors and stockholders approved amendments to the 1994 Plan which iincreased the number of shares authorized to be
issued under the 1994 Plan from 1,950,000 shares to 2,950,000 shares, iiadded an evergreen provision, the effect of which automatically increases the number of shares of our common stock available for issuance under the 1994 Plan
as of January1 of each year by three 
64 Table of Contents
percent 3%of our outstanding common stock as of December31 of the immediately preceding fiscal year, iiiadded non-employee directors as
persons eligible to receive options and other stock-based awards under the 1994 Plan and ivadded certain provisions to the 1994 Plan to ensure that options may qualify as performance-based compensation under Section162m of the Code.
In June 2002, our Board of Directors and stockholders approved an amendment to and restated the 1994 Plan which increased the stated number of shares authorized to be issued under the 1994 Plan by 750,000 shares. As of December31, 2005, a total of 763,192 shares of authorized and unissued shares were available for future grants. All options granted through
December31, 2005 have been Nonstatutory Stock Options. The 1994 Plan, as amended, is administered by the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors. Subject to the provisions of the 1994 Plan, the Compensation Committee has the authority to select the employees and consultants to whom options are granted and determine the terms of each option, including ithe
number of shares of common stock covered by the option, iiwhen the option becomes exercisable, iiithe options exercise price, which must be at least 100% with respect to Incentive Stock Options and at least 85% with respect to
Nonstatutory Stock Options of the fair market value of the common stock as of the date of grant, and ivthe duration of the option which may not exceed ten years. All options generally vest over three to five years, and are nontransferable
other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. The Compensation Committee has delegated to our Chief Executive Officer the authority to approve option grants to eligible employees under the 1994 Plan other than executive officers,
subject to certain numerical limits. 1995 Director Stock Option Plan We adopted the Directors Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan the Director Plan in 1995. However, in May 2000, our Board of Directors and stockholders voted to terminate the Director Plan such that no
further grants would be made thereunder, and further provided that non-employee directors are persons eligible to receive future options and other stock-based awards under the 1994 Plan, as discussed above. As of December31, 2005, there were
5,000 options outstanding under the Director Plan. Stock Warrants and Options Issued to Non-employees In October 2004, we issued options to purchase 45,000 shares of our common stock under our 1994 Plan to an investor and public relations consultant. The
options were issued at an exercise price of $1543 with a five-year term. Effective April11, 2005, as a result of the spin-off of eCOST.com, the exercise price of the options was reduced to $612 and the consultant received options to purchase
54,319 shares of eCOST.com common stock in the transaction. Of the original grant of options to purchase 45,000 shares, an aggregate of 7,500 shares of the options vested on the date of the grant, and the remaining shares vested quarterly over a
one-year period from the date of grant. We valued the options at fair value based on a Black-Scholes fair value calculation. The options were valued at the date of grant and were measured at fair value at each subsequent reporting period, with
changes in value recorded over the twelve month performance period of the option. The options became fully vested in October 2005. We recorded a cumulative compensation expense of $04 million, of which approximately $01 million related to 2005 and
$03 million related to 2004. The options were still outstanding at December31, 2005. In June 2003, we issued a warrant to purchase
30,000 shares of our common stock to a consulting firm for investor and public relations services. The warrant was issued at an exercise price of $399 with a five-year term, which vested monthly over a one year period from the date of grant.
Effective April11, 2005, as a result of the spin-off of eCOST.com, the exercise price of the warrant was reduced to $159, and the consulting firm received a warrant to purchase 36,213 shares of eCOST.com common stock in the transaction. We
valued the warrant at fair value based on a Black-Scholes fair value calculation. The warrant was valued at the date of grant and was measured at fair value at each subsequent reporting period, with changes in value recorded over the twelve month
performance period of the warrant. The warrant became fully vested in June 2004. We recorded a cumulative 
65 Table of Contents
compensation expense of $04 million, of which approximately $01 million related to 2004 and $03 million to 2003. The warrant was still outstanding at
December31, 2005. The following table summarizes stock option and warrant activity for the above plans:  Number WeightedAverage Exercise Price

13. Related-Party Transactions Frank F. Khulusi, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, became a greater than 10% stockholder of eCOST.com in April 2005 as a result of the spin-off of eCOST.com to our
stockholders. As a result of his direct and indirect beneficial interests in eCOST.com and us, eCOST.com became our related party. In
April and May 2005, subsequent to the completion of the spin-off of eCOST.com and in connection with its transition from us, AF Services, LLC formerly AF Services, Inc. AF Services entered into a product sales agreement and a
consignment and product sales agreement with eCOST.com, providing for the sale by AF Services of inventory items to eCOST.com generally at AF Services cost. The consignment and product sales agreement terminated in August 2005 and the product
sales agreement, which was extended for an additional month, terminated in September 2005. For the period between April12, 2005 and December31, 2005, we had net sales to eCOST.com of $316 million and we had a net receivable of $02
million from eCOST.com as of December31, 2005 included in Accounts receivable, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We are also a party to certain other agreements with eCOST.com that were entered into in conjunction with eCOST.coms IPO as follows: Master Separation and Distribution Agreement The Master Separation and Distribution Agreement contains the key provisions
relating to the separation of the eCOST.com business from our other businesses, the general terms and conditions and corporate transactions required to effect eCOST.coms IPO and the distribution and the general intent of the parties as to how
these matters would be undertaken and completed. The Master Separation and Distribution Agreement may be terminated by the mutual consent of eCOST.com and us. Tax Allocation and Indemnification Agreement The Tax Allocation and Indemnification Agreement
governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of us and eCOST.com after eCOST.coms IPO with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other matters regarding income taxes, non-income taxes and
related tax returns. See further discussion of this agreement in Note 3 and in Note 6. Administrative Services Agreement
Under the Administrative Services Agreement with eCOST.com, as amended in March 2005 to reduce the scope of the services covered by the
agreement and the monthly service charge to $19,000, we provided eCOST.com with certain general and administrative services, including but not limited to, the following:  payroll administration;  tax return preparation;  human resources administration;  product information management;  catalog advertising production services; and  accounting and finance services necessary for the preparation of eCOST.com financial statement for the periods through the date of the distribution. The Administrative Services Agreement terminated on September1, 2005 in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

Information Technology Systems Usage and Services Agreement Under the Information Technology Systems Usage and Services Agreement, we provide eCOST.com with usage of telecommunications systems and hardware
and software systems, information technology services and related support services, including maintaining eCOST.coms management information and reporting systems and hosting its website. As consideration for the services and the usage of the
hardware and software systems, eCOST.com pays a monthly fee of $40,000 and provides reimbursement for actual telecommunications systems usage charges. The agreement has a term of two years from eCOST.coms IPO, but either party may terminate
the agreement earlier by providing the other party 180 days prior written notice of such termination. On March1, 2006, eCOST.com notified us that it has elected to terminate this agreement effective June30, 2006 in accordance with its
termination rights under the agreement. Sublease Agreement Under the Sublease Agreement, eCOST.com currently leases office space from us located at our corporate headquarters in Torrance, California, of
approximately 11,000 square feet at $9,130 monthly base rent. In January 2006, the sublease was increased in rentable square feet to 14,300 at $11,869 monthly base rent. The sublease terminates in September 2007 pursuant to its terms; however, on
March1, 2006, eCOST.com notified us that it has elected to terminate this agreement effective June30, 2006 in accordance with its termination rights under the agreement. 14. Subsequent Event On February3, 2006, a purported class action lawsuit entitled Nicole
Atkins, et al. v. PC Mall, Inc., et al. was filed in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County. The potential class consists of all of our current and former account executives in California. The lawsuit alleges that we improperly
classified members of the putative class as exempt employees in violation of Californias wage and hour and unfair business practice laws and seeks unpaid overtime, statutory penalties, interest, attorneys fees, punitive
damages, restitution and injunctive relief. We plan to vigorously defend this litigation. Because the case is in its preliminary stages, we cannot yet predict its outcome and potential financial impact on our business, results of operations and
financial condition. We are not currently a party to any other material legal proceedings. From time to time, we receive claims of and
become subject to consumer protection, employment, intellectual property and other commercial litigation related to the conduct of our business. Any such litigation, including the litigation discussed above, could be costly and time consuming and
could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. In connection with any such litigation, we may be subject to significant damages or equitable remedies relating to the operation of our business. Any such litigation may
materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
