Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   Organization
and Nature of Operations   P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc. the Company
operates two restaurant concepts consisting of restaurants
throughout the United States under the name of P.F.
Changs China Bistro and Pei Wei Asian
Diner. The Company was formed in 1996 and became publicly
traded in 1998.   Fiscal
Year   The Companys fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to the
end of December and included 52weeks in 2003,
53weeks in 2004 and 52weeks in 2005.   Use of
Estimates   The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.   Principles
of Consolidation and Presentation   The Companys consolidated financial statements include the
accounts and operations of the Company and its subsidiaries and
partnerships in which it owns more than a 50percent
interest. All material balances and transactions between the
consolidated entities have been eliminated. Minority interest is
recorded as a reduction of the reported income or expense unless
the amount would result in a reduction of expense for which the
minority partner would not be responsible.   Cash
and Cash Equivalents   The Companys cash and cash equivalent balances are not
pledged or restricted. The Companys policy is to invest
cash in excess of operating requirements in income-producing
investments. Income-producing investments with maturities of
three months or less at the time of investment are reflected as
cash equivalents. Amounts receivable from credit card processors
are also considered cash equivalents because they are both
short-term and highly liquid in nature and are typically
converted to cash within three days of the sales transaction.
Cash equivalents at January1, 2006 consist primarily of
money market funds.   Short-term
and Restricted Short-term Investments   The Companys investments are classified as available for
sale, and have been recorded at fair value which approximates
cost. As of January2, 2005 and January1, 2006, the
Company held short-term investments in the amount of
$50million and $342million, respectively. The
Company also held $83million in restricted short-term
investments as of January1, 2006. There were no restricted
short term investments as of January2, 2005. The
short-term investments held on January2, 2005 consisted of
preferred stock investments in Dividends Received Eligible
Auction Market Stock DREAMS offered under private placements
by a subsidiary of Bank of America. The short-term investments
held on January1, 2006 consisted of Variable Rate Demand
Notes VRDNs and Auction Rate Preferred Stock
ARPs held by either Lehman Brothers or a subsidiary of
Bank of America. As of January1, 2006, the Company
participates in periodic auctions that are generally held every
7-49days depending on the investment type and that
determines the yield / dividend rate. The Company has the
opportunity to offer to sell its investment during such periodic
auctions subject to availability of buying bidders. Guided by
the Companys investment policy, Lehman Brothers and a
subsidiary of Bank of America maintain an investment portfolio
with a minimum rating of at least a grade of AA by Standard and
Poors or Aa by Moodys. The Companys restricted
investment balance includes investments that are committed for
the issuance of letters of credit, which are required by the
Companys insurance providers for workers
compensation and general liability claims.   
37 Table of Contents   P.F.
CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC.
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Receivables   Receivables, which the Company classifies in Prepaid and
other current assets, consist primarily of amounts due
from landlords or other parties for the reimbursement of
leasehold improvements paid by the Company. Management believes
these amounts to be collectible.   Inventories   Inventories consist of food and beverages and are stated at the
lower of cost or market using the
first-in,
first-out method.   Property
and Equipment   Property and equipment are stated at cost, which includes
capitalized interest during the construction and development
period. Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated on the
straight-line basis over the estimated useful service lives of
the related assets, which approximates seven years. Building is
depreciated on the straight-line basis over 30years, and
building improvements are depreciated on the straight-line basis
over 20years. Leasehold improvements and buildings under
capital lease are amortized over the shorter of the useful life
of the asset or the length of the related lease term. The term
of the lease includes renewal option periods only in instances
in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably
assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an
economic penalty. China and smallwares are depreciated over two
years up to 50percent of their original cost, and
subsequent additions are expensed as purchased. Depreciation and
amortization expense associated with property and equipment,
including property under capital leases, amounted to
$214million, $291million and $363million,
for the years ended December28, 2003,
January2, 2005 and January1, 2006, respectively.   During the years ended December28, 2003, January2,
2005 and January1, 2006, the Company incurred gross
interest expense of approximately $117,000, $61,000 and
$34million, respectively. Approximately $106,000, $58,000
and $34million, respectively, of interest costs were
capitalized during the years ended December28, 2003,
January2, 2005 and January1, 2006.   The Company reviews property and equipment which includes
leasehold improvements for impairment when events or
circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired, but at
least annually. The Company tests impairment using historical
cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the
primary basis for an estimate of future cash flows. The analysis
is performed at the restaurant level for indicators of permanent
impairment. As of January1, 2006, no impairment on
long-lived assets has been recognized. There can be no assurance
that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to
earnings.   Goodwill
and Intangibles   Goodwill represents the residual purchase price after allocation
of the purchase price of assets acquired. Goodwill and
intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not
amortized, but are subject to annual impairment tests.
Intangible assets deemed to have definite lives are amortized
over their estimated useful lives.   Impairment tests are performed with respect to goodwill at the
segment level of reporting. On an annual basis, the Company
reviews the recoverability of goodwill based primarily on a
multiple of earnings analysis comparing the fair value of the
reporting segment to the carrying value. Generally, the Company
performs its annual assessment for impairment during the fourth
quarter of its fiscal year and will perform the analysis more
frequently if there are any impairment indicators identified
during the year. As of January1, 2006, management
determined there was no impairment of goodwill. There can be no
assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result
in a charge to earnings.   Intangible assets, which the Company classifies as Other
assets, consist of the excess of the purchase price at the
time the Company repurchases a partners interest over the
imputed fair value of that interest at the time of the original
investment. These assets are amortized over their useful lives,
which is generally 15years.

CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC.
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   The Company reviews intangible assets with finite lives those
assets resulting from the acquisition of minority interests in
the operating rights of certain of our restaurants for
impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets
might be impaired, but at least quarterly. The Company tests
impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts
and circumstances as the primary basis for an estimate of future
cash flows. The analysis is performed at the restaurant, or
partnership level, for indicators of impairment. As of
January1, 2006, no impairment of intangible assets has
been recognized. There can be no assurance that future
intangible assets impairment tests will not result in a charge
to earnings.   Accrued
Insurance   The Company is self-insured for certain exposures, principally
general liability, workers compensation, medical and
dental for the first $100,000, $250,000 or $500,000 of
individual claims, depending on the type of claim. The Company
has paid amounts to its insurance carrier that approximates the
cost of claims known to date and has provided additional accrued
liabilities for its estimate of ultimate costs related to those
claims. In developing these estimates, the Company and its
insurance providers use historical experience factors to
estimate the ultimate claim exposure. In validating self
insurance reserves, the Company contracted with a third-party
actuary who utilizes estimates of expected losses, based on
statistical analyses of historical industry data as well as the
Companys own estimates based on the Companys actual
historical trends. It is reasonably possible that future
adjustments to these estimates will be required. Based upon the
information known at January1, 2006, management believes
it has provided adequate reserves for its self-insured exposure.   Lease
Obligation   The Company leases all of its restaurant properties. At the
inception of the lease, each property is evaluated to determine
whether the lease will be accounted as an operating or capital
lease. The term of the lease used for this evaluation includes
renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise
of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to
exercise such option would result in an economic penalty.   For leases that contain rent escalations, the Company records
the total rent payable during the lease term, as determined
above, on the straight-line basis over the term of the lease
including the rent holiday period beginning upon
possession of the premises, and records the difference between
the minimum rents paid and the straight-line rent as lease
obligation.   Certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental
payments based upon restaurant sales volume contingent
rentals. Contingent rentals are accrued each period as
the liabilities are incurred, in addition to the straight-line
rent expense noted above.   It is the Companys policy to capitalize rent expense from
possession date through construction completion. This asset is
included in property and equipment. Capitalized rent is
amortized through depreciation and amortization expense over the
estimated useful life of the related assets limited to the lease
term. Straight-line rent recorded during the preopening period
construction completion through restaurant open date is
recorded as preopening expense. Once a restaurant opens for
business, the Company records the straight-line rent over the
lease term plus contingent rent to the extent it exceeded
minimum rent obligation per the lease agreement. In accordance
with FASB Staff Position
No13-1,
Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a Construction
Period, as of January2, 2006, the Company will expense
rent from possession date through restaurant open date as
preopening expense see Note1Recent
Accounting Pronouncement.   Unearned
Revenue   Unearned revenue represents gift cards sold for which revenue
recognition criteria, generally redemption, has not been met.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Revenue
Recognition   Revenues from food, beverage and alcohol sales are recognized as
products are sold. Revenues from unredeemed gift cards are
recognized after a reasonable period of card inactivity
generally 24months.   Advertising   The Company expenses advertising as incurred. Advertising
expense for the years ended December28, 2003,
January2, 2005 and January1, 2006 was approximately
$28million, $37million and $41million,
respectively.   Partner
Bonus Expense, Imputed   Partner bonus expense, which is classified as Labor,
represents the portion of restaurant level operating results
that are allocable to minority partners, but are presented as
bonus expense for accounting purposes. Given that employees who
choose to invest as partners are not eligible to participate in
the restaurant-level bonus program, a portion of their
partnership earnings that would otherwise be presented as
minority interest expense is deemed to be a bonus expense for
financial reporting purposes. The amounts so imputed are based
on the existing bonus programs used by the Company for
non-investing employees based on individual restaurant
level-operating results. Partner bonus expense, imputed for the
years ended December28, 2003, January2, 2005, and
January1, 2006 was $14million, $18million,
and $18million, respectively.   Preopening
Expense   Preopening expenses, consisting primarily of manager salaries
and relocation expense, employee payroll and related training
costs incurred prior to the opening of a restaurant, are
expensed as incurred. Also included in preopening expense is the
accrual for straight-line rent recorded for the period between
construction completion and the restaurant opening date, which
generally approximates two weeks. In accordance with FASB Staff
Position No.
13-1,
Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a Construction
Period, as of January2, 2006, the Company will no
longer capitalize rent during the construction period which will
increase preopening costs during 2006 see
Note1Recent Accounting Pronouncement.   Partner
Investment Expense   Prior to the date of modification of certain operating
agreements which occurred on March28, 2004, partner
investment expense consisted of two components:
iunearned compensation calculated as the difference
between the imputed fair value of partners ownership
interests at the time the partners invest in their restaurants

repurchased a partners interest over the imputed fair
value of that interest.   In addition, under Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 44 FIN44, Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation and Interpretation of
APB Opinion No25, the estimated fair value for each
partnership interest, affected by the agreement modification
noted above, was determined at the date of modification. To the

at which the partner would have otherwise earned the right to
have their investment interest purchased at fair value.   Partner investment expense for the year ended December28,
2003 was $42million, which included amortization of
unearned compensation expense of $33million and buyout
expense of $09million. Partner investment expense for the
year ended January2, 2005 was $177million, which
included $125million in unearned compensation expense
related to the modification of partner interests during the
first quarter of 2004 along with $52million in unearned

STATEMENTSContinued   Income
Taxes   The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for
income taxes as set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are
determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted
tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are
expected to reverse. Recognition of deferred tax assets is
limited to amounts considered by management to be more likely
than not of realization in future periods.   Minority interests relating to the income or loss of
consolidated partnerships includes no provision for income taxes
as any tax liability related thereto is the responsibility of
the individual minority investors.   Stock-Based
Compensation   The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to
certain employees and directors with an exercise price equal to
or greater than the fair value of the shares at the date of
grant. The Company accounted for stock option grants in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB
No25and related interpretations for fiscal 2005
and prior, and, accordingly, recognized no compensation expense
for the stock option grants.   The following table represents the effect on net income and

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Concentrations
of Credit Risk   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of
cash investments and receivables. The Company maintains cash and
cash equivalents, funds on deposit and certain other financial
instruments with financial institutions that are considered in
the Companys investment strategy. Concentrations of credit
risk with respect to receivables are limited as the
Companys receivables are primarily with its landlords for
the reimbursement of tenant improvements.   Reclassifications   Certain amounts shown in the prior periods consolidated
financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
current year consolidated financial statement presentation.   Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   On December16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued SFASNo123 revised 2004
SFAS123R, Share-Based Payment,
which is a revision of SFASNo123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS123R supersedes
Accounting Principles Board APB No25, and amends
SFASNo95, Statement of Cash Flows.
Generally, SFAS123R requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
recognized in the income statement based on their fair values
determined at the date of grant. Pro forma disclosure is no
longer an alternative. On April14, 2005, the Securities
and Exchange Commission adopted a new rule that amends the
compliance dates for SFAS123R. Under the new rule, the
Company adopted SFAS123R on January2, 2006.   As permitted by SFASNo123, prior to January2,
2006, the Company accounted for share-based payments to
employees using the intrinsic value method and, as such,
generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock
options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS123Rs
fair value method will have a significant impact on the
Companys results of operations, although it will have no
impact on the Companys overall financial position. The
estimated impact of adopting SFAS123R for 2006, relating
to prior year grants only, will be approximately $90 to
$95million $55 to $59million, net of tax. This
estimate includes costs related to unvested stock options and
current stock compensation programs. However, had the Company
adopted SFAS123R in prior periods, the impact of that
standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS123 as
described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings
per share in Note1. SFAS123R also requires the
benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation
cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an
operating cash flow as required under current literature. This
requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase
net financing cash flows in the periods after adoption. While
the Company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the
future because they depend on, among other things, when
employees exercise stock options, the amount of operating cash
flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions
were $50million, $70million and $32million
in 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively.   On October6, 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position
No13-1
FSP
13-1,
Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a Construction
Period. Generally, the staff position requires companies to
expense rental costs incurred during a construction period. As
permitted prior to the adoption of FSP
13-1, the
Company capitalized rental costs during construction. The
Company adopted FSP
13-1 on
January2, 2006. The financial impact of the adoption of
the staff position is expected to range from approximately
$15million to $18million in additional preopening
rent expense during 2006 which may vary based on lease terms,
store openings and length of construction period.   In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS154, Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections, which changes the accounting
for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. This
statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting
principle and changes required by an accounting pronouncement in
the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include
specific transition provisions. This statement requires
retrospective application to prior period financial statements
of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impractical to
determine either the period-specific or cumulative effects of
the change. SFAS154 is effective for accounting changes

Any options granted shall not be exercisable after ten years.
Upon certain changes in control of the Company, the 1996 and

for discretionary grants of incentive stock options and
nonqualified stock options to the Companys employees,
including officers, directors, consultants, advisors, and other

Committee has the authority to, among other things, determine
the vesting schedule for each option granted. All options expire

program for outside directors. Pursuant to this program, each
outside director will be granted an option to purchase
30,000shares of common stock at the time he or she is
first elected or appointed a director of the Company, as well as
a fully-vested non-qualified stock option grant for
15,000shares of common stock upon re-election. In
addition, those directors serving as chairperson of each
committee receive an additional automatic option grant upon
re-election each year as follows: Audit Committee
3,000shares, Compensation and Executive Development
Committee 1,500shares and Nominating and Corporate

of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 1999
Plan. The option price per share may not be less than
100percent of the fair market value of a share of common
stock on the grant date. The Companys Compensation
Committee has the authority to, among other things, determine
the vesting schedule for each option granted. All options expire
within 10years.   The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use
in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no
vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.
Because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate, in managements
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a
reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   The agreements with the Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Administrative Officer and the President of the Company provide
for immediate vesting of unvested stock options, and the
extension of the expiration date to three years, after the
occurrence of certain events. These events include a change in
control of the Company, termination of the executives

be required to record an expense based upon the difference
between the original grant price and the fair value at the
modification date for the number of shares ultimately affected
by the modification. As of January1, 2006, approximately
909,000shares were affected by these agreements of which
approximately 294,000shares were unvested.   The agreement with the President of Pei Wei Asian Diner, Inc.
contains similar provisions with respect to a change in control
for Pei Wei Asian Diner, Inc. and termination without cause but
also includes a provision whereby the Company could be required

Partnership
Structure   P.F. Changs utilizes a partnership structure to facilitate
the development, leadership and operation of its restaurants.
Each partner is required to make a capital contribution in
exchange for their percentage interest in the restaurant or
region the partner is employed to manage. The ownership interest
purchased by each partner generally ranges between two and ten
percent of the restaurant or region the partner oversees. At the
end of a specific term generally five years, P.F. Changs
has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the minority
partners interest in the partners respective
restaurant or region at fair market value. An estimated fair
value is determined by reference to current industry purchase
metrics as well as the average cash flows of the subject
restaurants or regions financial results. The
Company has the option to pay the agreed upon purchase price in
cash or common stock of the Company over a period of time not to
exceed five years.   As of January1, 2006, there were 207 partners within the
P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc. system. During 2004 and
2005, the Company purchased interests held by 10 and 19 minority
partners, respectively, for a total of approximately
$20million and $162million, respectively. During
2004 and 2005, approximately $10million and
$61million, respectively, of the total purchase price was
paid in cash while the remaining balance has been recorded as
debt on the balance sheet. In 2006, the Company will have the
opportunity to purchase an additional 27partnership
interests.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   The FICA tip credit carryforward begins to expire in 2024. For
the year ended January1, 2006 the tip credits were
assessed as probable of utilization prior to their expiration.   At January1, 2006, the Company took advantage of
additional tax deductions available relating to the exercise of
non-qualified stock options and disqualifying dispositions of
incentive stock options. Accordingly, for the years ended
December28, 2003, January2, 2005 and January1,
2006, the Company recorded a $50million,
$70million and $32million, respectively, increase
to equity with a corresponding reduction to income tax
liability. Quarterly adjustments for the exercise of
non-qualified stock options and disqualifying dispositions of
incentive stock options may vary as they relate to the actions
of the option holder or shareholder.   The reserve for tax contingencies was $26million and
$24million, respectively, at January2, 2005 and
January1, 2006. This balance is the Companys best
estimate of the potential liability for tax contingencies. The
decline in the tax contingency reserve was primarily due to the
closure of audits and the expiration of the statute of
limitations, partially offset by additions due to changes in tax
laws and current year requirements for asserted and unasserted
items. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax
contingencies due to changes in tax law, both legislated and
concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court
systems.

Commitments
and Contingencies   Purchase
Obligations   The Company enters into various purchase obligations in the
ordinary course of its business. Those that are binding relate
primarily to certain commodities contracts and construction for
restaurants planned to open in the near future. At
January1, 2006, such purchase obligations approximated
$447million and were due within the following
12-month
period.   Litigation   The Company is engaged in legal actions arising in the ordinary
course of business and believes that the ultimate outcome of
these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the
results of operations, liquidity or financial position.

Segment
Reporting   The Company operates exclusively in the food-service industry
and has determined that its reportable segments are those that
are based on the Companys methods of internal reporting
and management structure. The Companys reportable segments
are Bistro and Pei Wei. There were no material amounts of
revenues or transfers among reportable segments. Additionally,
beginning in fiscal year 2005, the Company began classifying
certain general and administrative expenses, which benefit both

Controls
and Procedures   Disclosure Controls and ProceduresWe
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the
Companys reports under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to management,
including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and
Chief Financial Officer CFO, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognized that any controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
objectives, as the Companys are designed to do, and
management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures.   In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on
Form10-K,
as of January1, 2006, an evaluation was performed under
the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as
defined in
Rule13a-15e
under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and
CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of January1, 2006.   Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over
Financial ReportingOur management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule13a-15f
under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed
to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management
and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements. All internal
control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent
limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and presentation.   Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of January1, 2006. In
making its assessment of internal control over financial
reporting, management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the
Treadway Commission in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on this
assessment, our CEO and CFO concluded that our internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of January1,
2006 based on the criteria set forth by COSO in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework.   Our independent registered public accounting firm,
Ernst Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on
managements assessment of our internal control over
financial reporting. This report appears below.   Change in Internal Control Over Financial
ReportingThere were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.   
56 Table of Contents   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   The Board of Directors and Stockholders of   P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc.   We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting, that P.F. Changs China Bistro,
Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of January1, 2006, based on criteria
established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission the COSOcriteria. P.F.
Changs China Bistro, Inc.s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   In our opinion, managements assessment that P.F.
Changs China Bistro, Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of January1, 2006, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the
COSOcriteria. Also, in our opinion, P.F. Changs
China Bistro, Inc. maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
January1, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc.
as of January2, 2005 and January1, 2006, and the
related consolidated statements of income, common
stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended January1, 2006 and our report
dated February13, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.   /s/ Ernst Young LLP   Phoenix, Arizona   February13, 2006
