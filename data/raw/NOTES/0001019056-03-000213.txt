Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
31 24 Report of Independent Auditors The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Covance Inc. We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Covance Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provided a reasonable basis for our
opinion. In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Covance Inc. and
subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. As
discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 in 2002.

conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements are the responsibility of Covances

evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audit provided a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. We have not

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000
Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise indicated 1.Organization Covance
Inc. and its subsidiaries Covance is a leading drug development
services company providing a wide range of product development services on a
worldwide basis primarily to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical
device industries. Covance also provides services such as laboratory testing to
the chemical, agrochemical and food industries. Covances operations
constitute two segments for financial reporting purposes. The first segment,
early development services, includes preclinical and Phase I clinical service
offerings. The second segment, late-stage development services, includes central
laboratory, clinical development, commercialization and other clinical support
services. Operations are principally focused in the United States and Europe. 2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles
of Consolidation The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities
controlled by Covance, including through June 15, 2001, Covance Biotechnology
Services Inc. Biomanufacturing, a majority owned business. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Use
of Estimates These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these
estimates. Reclassifications Certain
prior period balances have been reclassified to conform with current year
presentation. Foreign
Currencies For
subsidiaries outside of the United States that operate in a local currency
environment, income and expense items are translated to United States dollars at
the monthly average rates of exchange prevailing during the year, assets and
liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates and equity accounts are
translated at historical exchange rates. Translation adjustments are accumulated
in a separate component of stockholders equity in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets and are included in the determination of comprehensive income in the
Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity. Transaction gains and
losses are included in the determination of net income in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Cash
and Cash Equivalents Cash
and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less at date of purchase and consist principally of
amounts temporarily invested in money market funds. Financial
Instruments The
fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
accrued expenses and long and short-term debt are not materially different than
their carrying amounts as reported at December 31, 2002 and 2001. 31 COVANCE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
DECEMBER 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000
Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise indicated 2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued Accounts
receivable and unbilled services represent amounts due from Covance customers
who are concentrated primarily in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology
industries. Covance endeavors to monitor the creditworthiness of its customers
to which it grants credit terms in the ordinary course of business. Although
Covance customers are concentrated primarily within these two industries,
management considers the likelihood of material credit risk as remote. In
addition, in some cases Covance requires advance payment for a portion of the
contract price from its customers upon the signing of a contract for services.
These amounts are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are performed.
Historically, bad debts have been minimal. Inventory Inventories,
which consist principally of finished goods and supplies, are valued at the
lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market. Prepaid
Expenses and Other Current Assets In
connection with the management of multi-site clinical trials, Covance pays on
behalf of its customers fees to investigators, volunteers and other
out-of-pocket costs such as travel, printing, meetings, couriers, etc., for
which we are reimbursed at cost, without mark-up or profit. Amounts receivable
from customers in connection with billed and unbilled investigator fees,
volunteer payments and other out-of-pocket pass-through costs are included in
prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets and totaled $133 million and $172 million at December 31, 2002
and 2001. See Note 2 Reimbursable Out-of-Pocket Expenses. Property
and Equipment Property
and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided
on the straight-line method at rates adequate to allocate the cost of the
applicable assets over their estimated useful lives, which range in term from
three to thirty years. The cost of computer software developed or obtained for
internal use is accounted for in accordance with the Accounting Standards
Executive Committees Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. Repairs
and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Goodwill
and Impairment of Goodwill Effective
January 1, 2002, in accordance with the adoption of FASB Statement No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Covance ceased amortization of
goodwill. Prior to January 1, 2002, goodwill investment costs in excess of the
fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was
capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period expected to
be benefited, which was generally twenty years or less, except for acquisitions
prior to 1996 which were being amortized over forty years. Had amortization
expense not been recorded for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the
impact on income from operations, net income and earnings per share would have
been an increase of $36 million, $29 million and $005 per share, respectively
in 2001 and $35 million, $28 million and $005 per share, respectively, in
2000. See Note 14 Unaudited 2001 and 2000 Pro Forma Financial
Information. Statement No. 142 also outlines the requirements for annual
goodwill impairment tests, and accordingly, Covance performs an annual test for
impairment of goodwill. The annual test for impairment performed for 2002 did
not identify any instances of impairment. Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets Effective
January 1, 2002, Covance assesses impairment of long-lived assets in accordance
with FASB Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets. Assessments of the recoverability of long-lived assets
are conducted when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that
the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of
possible impairment is based upon the ability to recover the asset from the
expected future undiscounted cash flows of related operations. 32 COVANCE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
DECEMBER 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000
Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise indicated 2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued Revenue
Recognition Covance
recognizes revenue either as services are performed or products are delivered,
depending upon the nature of the work contracted. Historically, a majority of
Covances net revenues have been earned under contracts which range in
duration from a few months to two years, but can extend in duration up to five
years or longer. Service contracts generally take the form of fee-for-service or
fixed-price arrangements. In the case of fee-for-service contracts, revenue is
recognized as services are performed, based upon, for example, hours worked or
samples tested. For long-term fixed-price service contracts, revenue is
recognized as services are performed, with performance generally assessed using
output measures, such as units-of-work performed to date as compared to the
total units-of-work contracted. Changes in the scope of work generally result in
a renegotiation of contract pricing terms. Renegotiated amounts are not included
in net revenues until earned and realization is assured. Estimates of costs to
complete are made, as appropriate, to provide for losses expected on contracts.
Costs are not deferred in anticipation of contracts being awarded, but instead
are expensed as incurred. In some cases, for multi-year contracts a portion of
the contract fee is paid at the time the trial is initiated. These advances are
deferred and recognized as revenue as services are performed, as discussed
above. Additional payments may be made based upon the achievement of
performance-based milestones over the contract duration. Most contracts are
terminable by the client either immediately or upon notice. These contracts
typically require payment to Covance of expenses to wind down the study, fees
earned to date and, in some cases, a termination fee or a payment to Covance of
some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned by Covance under
the contract if it had not been terminated early. In connection with the
management of multi-site clinical trials, Covance pays on behalf of its
customers fees to investigators, volunteers and other out-of-pocket costs such
as for travel, printing, meetings, couriers, etc., for which it is reimbursed at
cost, without mark-up or profit. Investigator fees are not reflected in total
revenues or expenses where Covance acts in the capacity of an agent on behalf of
the pharmaceutical company sponsor, passing through these costs without risk or
reward to Covance. All other out-of-pocket costs are included in total revenues
and expenses. Unbilled
services are recorded for revenue recognized to date and relate to amounts that
are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms. In
general, amounts become billable upon the achievement of milestones or in
accordance with predetermined payment schedules. Unbilled services are billable
to customers within one year from the respective balance sheet date. Unearned
revenue is recorded for cash received from customers for which revenue has not
been recognized at the balance sheet date. Costs
and Expenses Cost
of revenue generally includes appropriate amounts necessary to complete the
revenue and earnings process and includes direct labor and related benefit
charges, other direct costs and an allocation of facility charges and
information technology costs and excludes depreciation and amortization. Also,
cost of revenue includes shipping and handling fees and reimbursable
out-of-pocket costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily
consist of administrative payroll and related benefit charges, advertising and
promotional expenses, administrative travel and an allocation of facility
charges and information technology costs. Advertising expense is recognized as
incurred. Taxes
on Income Covance
uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected
future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect
for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The
effect on deferred taxes of a change in enacted tax rates is recognized in
income in the period when the change is effective. See Note 6. 33 COVANCE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
DECEMBER 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000
Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise indicated 2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued Covance
has established, and periodically reviews and reevaluates, an estimated income
tax reserve on its consolidated balance sheet to provide for the possibility of
adverse outcomes in tax proceedings. When matters are settled or when facts
indicate a material change in the probability or amount of the potential
exposure, Covance adjusts the carrying value of the related reserve. As a result
of favorable income tax developments, relating primarily to the settlement of a
longstanding multi-year foreign income tax audit, Covance reduced its income tax
reserve and provision by $65 million during 2002. Comprehensive
Income Covances
total comprehensive income represents net income plus the change in the
cumulative translation adjustment equity account for the periods presented. Stock
Based Compensation Covance
grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise
price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant. Covance
accounts for stock option grants in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and related
Interpretations. Under APB 25, when stock options are issued with an exercise
price equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no
compensation expense is recognized. Earnings
Per Share EPS Basic
EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The computation
of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS, except that the
denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that
would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been
issued; computed under the treasury stock method in accordance with the
requirements of FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings Per Share. In
computing diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the
denominator was increased by 1,356,037 shares, 1,526,965 shares and 67,981
shares, respectively, representing the dilutive effect of stock options
outstanding at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, with exercise prices less than
the average market price of Covances common stock during each respective
period. Excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for the year ended December
31, 2002 were options to purchase 3,035,281 shares of common stock at prices
ranging from $1898 to $2913 per share because the exercise prices of such
options were greater than the average market price of Covances common
stock during 2002. Excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for the year
ended December 31, 2001 were options to purchase 3,242,366 shares of common
stock at prices ranging from $1778 to $2913 per share because the exercise
prices of such options were greater than the average market price of
Covances common stock during 2001. Excluded from the computation of
diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2000 were options to purchase
6,966,550 shares of common stock at prices ranging from $1075 to $2913 per
share because the exercise prices of such options were greater than the average
market price of Covances common stock during 2000. Reimbursable
Out-of-Pocket Expenses As
discussed in Note 2 Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets,
Covance pays on behalf of its customers fees to investigators, volunteers and
other out-of-pocket costs for which we are reimbursed at cost, without mark-up
or profit. Effective January 1, 2002, in connection with the required

Issued Accounting Standards On
December 31, 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Statement
No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure.
Statement No. 148 amends FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition to Statement No. 123
fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation for an entity
that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation. Statement No. 148 also requires prominent disclosure of the
effects of an entity accounting policy with respect to stock-based employee
compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim
financial statements. Covance intends to continue to follow the disclosure-only
provisions of FASB Statement No. 123 and, accordingly, will continue to apply
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and its related interpretations in
accounting for its plans. The adoption of Statement No. 148 will have no impact on
Covance results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 3.Property and Equipment Property

July 2002, Covance acquired the stock of Virtual Central Laboratory b.v. now
known as Covance Virtual Central Laboratory b.v. for a cash payment of $30
million. The goodwill resulting from this transaction aggregated $27 million. On
June 15, 2001, Covance sold its biomanufacturing business Biomanufacturing
to Akzo Nobels pharma business unit, Diosynth, for gross proceeds of $1136
million, subject to post-closing adjustments, including finalization of the closing
balance sheet and earnout provision, in accordance with the Stock Purchase Agreement
between Covance and Akzo Nobel, which remains to be resolved between the parties.
Covance recognized a loss of $75 million $45 million after tax from this
transaction. Covance used the net proceeds from the sale of approximately $95 million to
reduce borrowings under its senior revolving credit facility. See Note 14. On
February 14, 2001, Covance sold its pharmaceutical packaging business Packaging
to Fisher Scientific International Inc. for gross proceeds of $1375 million. Covance
recognized a pre-tax gain of $384 million $243 million after tax from this
transaction. Covance used the net proceeds from the sale to repay the $185 million
balance outstanding on the mortgage on its North American packaging facility and the
remaining net proceeds of approximately $95 million were used to reduce borrowings under
its senior revolving credit facility. See Note 14. 6.Taxes on Income The

During
the third quarter of 2002, Covance recognized a tax benefit of $65 million resulting
from favorable income tax developments, relating primarily to the settlement of a
longstanding foreign income tax audit. At
December 31, 2002 and 2001, Covance has net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $16 million and $24 million, respectively, which expire in the years
2009 through 2020 and are available to offset future Federal taxable income. Covance
currently provides income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries to the extent
those earnings are taxable or are expected to be remitted. Taxes have not been provided
on the remaining $889 million of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings because those
earnings are expected to remain invested indefinitely. It is not practical to estimate
the amount of additional tax that might be payable if such accumulated earnings were
remitted. Additionally, if such accumulated earnings were remitted, certain countries
impose withholding taxes that, subject to certain limitations, are available for use as
a tax credit against any Federal income tax liability arising from such remittance. 7.Short and Long-Term Debt On
June 28, 2001, Covance replaced its credit facility with a new $1500 million senior
revolving credit facility the Credit Facility which expires in June 2004.
At December 31, 2002 there were no outstanding borrowings and $16 million of
outstanding letters of credit, under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2001 there was
$150 million of outstanding borrowings and $09 million of outstanding letters of
credit, under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2002, Covance has a remaining
availability under the Credit Facility of $1484 million of which $234 million remains
available for letters of credit. Interest on all outstanding borrowings under Covances
Credit Facility is based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus
a margin and approximated 328%, 721% and 750% per annum for the years ended December
31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Costs associated with replacing the senior
revolving credit facility, consisting primarily of bank fees totaling $17 million, are
being amortized over the three year term of the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility
contains various covenants, which among other things, restrict certain uses of cash such
as certain restrictions on Covances ability to pay cash dividends on the Covance
common stock. At December 31, 2002, Covance was in compliance with the terms of its
Credit Facility. Commitment fees paid during 2002, 2001 and 2000, which under the prior
senior revolving credit facility were 05 percent of the revolving committed amount, and
under the new Credit Facility were 05 percent of the undrawn balance of the Credit
Facility, approximated $07 million, $10 million, and $03 million, respectively. The
Credit Facility is collateralized by guarantees of certain of Covances domestic
subsidiaries and a pledge of 65 percent of the capital stock of certain of Covances
foreign subsidiaries. 37 COVANCE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise indicated 7.Short and Long-Term Debt Continued Covance
used the net proceeds from the 2001 sales of Packaging and Biomanufacturing of
approximately $1800 million to reduce borrowings under its senior revolving credit
facility. In addition, the $185 million mortgage debt associated with the North
American packaging facility and the Biomanufacturing $100 million short-term revolving
credit facility were repaid at the time of the divestitures. 8.Employee Benefit Plans Covance
sponsors various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. Defined
Contribution Plans U.S.
employees are eligible to participate in Covances 401k plan, while employees in
international locations are eligible to participate in either defined benefit or defined
contribution plans, depending on the plan offered at their location. Aggregate Covance
contributions to its various defined contribution plans totaled $123 million, $124
million and $133 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Defined
Benefit Pension Plans Covance
sponsors two defined benefit pension plans for the benefit of its employees at two
United Kingdom subsidiaries and one defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of its
employees at a German subsidiary, all of which are legacy plans of previously acquired
companies. Benefit amounts for all three plans are based upon years of service and
compensation. The German plan is unfunded while the UK plans are funded. Covances
funding policy has been to contribute annually a fixed percentage of the eligible
employees salary at least equal to the local statutory funding requirements.
Pension plan assets are administered by the plans trustees and are principally
invested in equity and fixed income securities. The components of net periodic pension
expense for these plans for 2002, 2001 and 2000 are as follows:

Stock Covance
is authorized to issue up to 100 million shares of Series Preferred Stock, par value
$100 per share the Covance Series Preferred Stock. The Covance Board of
Directors has the authority to issue such shares from time to time, without stockholder
approval, and to determine the designations, preferences, rights, including voting
rights, and restrictions of such shares, subject to the Delaware General Corporate Laws.
Pursuant to this authority, the Covance Board of Directors has designated 10 million
shares of the Covance Series Preferred Stock as Covance Series A Preferred Stock. No
other class of Covance Series Preferred Stock has been designated by the Board. As of
December 31, 2002, no Covance Series Preferred Stock has been issued or is outstanding. Dividends-Common
Stock Covances
Board of Directors may declare dividends on the shares of Covance common stock out of
legally available funds subject to any preferential rights of any outstanding Covance
Series Preferred Stock. However, Covance has no present intention to declare dividends,
but instead intends to retain earnings to provide funds for the operation and expansion
of its business. In addition, the Credit Facility restricts certain uses of cash such as
certain restrictions on paying cash dividends on the Covance common stock. Treasury
Stock During
2002, Covance purchased into treasury 1,005,000 shares of its common stock for the
aggregate cost of $166 million, pursuant to a Board of Directors authorized 3,000,000
share buyback program. There are no shares remaining to be purchased under this
program. In addition, Covance acquired approximately 43,000 shares of its common stock
into treasury in connection with re-load stock option exercises and a total of
approximately 55,000 shares of its common stock to satisfy income tax withholding
associated with the vesting of stock awards during the three year period ended December
31, 2002. The fair value of common stock obtained for re-load stock option exercises was
approximately $10 million during the three year period ended December 31, 2002. Stock
Compensation Plans In
June 2002, Covances Board of Directors adopted the 2002 Employee Stock Option Plan
the 2002 ESOP. The 2002 ESOP will expire on June 24, 2012. The 2002 ESOP
authorizes the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors the
Compensation Committee, or such committee as is appointed by the Covance
Board of Directors, to administer the 2002 ESOP, to grant awards to employees of Covance
or entities in which Covance has a controlling or significant interest, except that
officers as defined in Rule 16a-1f of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and
members of the Board of Directors are not eligible to receive awards. The 2002 ESOP
authorizes the Compensation Committee to grant the following awards to eligible
employees: options to purchase common stock and stock appreciation rights. The number of
shares of Covance common stock initially available for grant under the 2002 ESOP totaled
59 million. At December 31, 2002, there were approximately 58 million shares remaining
available for grants or awards under the 2002 ESOP. 41 COVANCE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

May 2002, Covances shareholders approved the 2002 Employee Equity Participation
Plan the 2002 EEPP in replacement of the 2000 Employee Equity
Participation Plan the 2000 EEPP. The 2002 EEPP became effective on May 7,
2002 and will expire on May 6, 2012. The 2002 EEPP authorizes the Compensation
Committee, or such committee as is appointed by the Covance Board of Directors, to
administer the 2002 EEPP, to grant awards to employees and consultants of Covance or
entities in which Covance has a controlling or significant interest. The 2002 EEPP
authorizes the Compensation Committee to grant the following awards to eligible
employees: options to purchase common stock; stock appreciation rights; and other stock
awards either singly or in combination. The number of shares of Covance common stock
initially available for grant under the 2002 EEPP totaled approximately 325 million
plus approximately 09 million shares remaining available under the 2000 EEPP at the
time the 2002 EEPP was approved. Effective upon approval of the 2002 EEPP, no further
grants or awards were permitted under the 2000 EEPP. All grants and awards under the
2000 EEPP remaining outstanding are now administered and paid in accordance with the
provisions of the 2000 EEPP out of shares issuable under the 2002 EEPP. At December 31,
2002 there were approximately 42 million shares remaining available for grants or
awards under the 2002 EEPP. Covance records compensation expense related to awards of
stock ratably over the three year vesting period, which totaled $31 million, $15
million and $09 million, during 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Covance
also has a noncompensatory employee stock purchase plan the ESPP pursuant
to which Covance may make available for sale to employees shares of its common stock at
a price equal to 85% of the lower of the market value on the first or last day of each
calendar quarter. The ESPP, administered by the Compensation Committee, is intended to
give Covance employees the opportunity to purchase shares of Covance common stock
through payroll deductions. A maximum of 30 million shares may be purchased by Covance
employees under the ESPP. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, a total of 167,422 shares, 329,513
shares and 490,034 shares of common stock, respectively, were issued under the ESPP. At
December 31, 2002, there were approximately 13 million shares remaining for purchase
under the ESPP. Covance
has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of FASB Statement No. 123 SFAS 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and accordingly, applies Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its plans.
Had Covance elected to recognize compensation expense in accordance with the provisions
of SFAS 123 for the stock option awards and for the stock purchased by Covance employees
under the ESPP, its net income in 2002, 2001 and 2000 would have been $564 million 422 million and $86 million, respectively; its basic and diluted earnings per share
would have been $094 and $092, respectively, in 2002; its basic and diluted earnings
per share would have been $072 and $070 in 2001; and its basic and diluted earnings
per share would both have been $015 in 2000. The fair value of the Covance stock
options used to compute the net income and earnings per share disclosures required under
SFAS 123 is the estimated present value at grant date using the Black-Scholes

Operating
lease rental expense aggregated $301 million, $313 million and $337 million for 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively. 11.Restructuring In
June 2001, Covance announced plans to reorganize its Nexigent subsidiary, integrating
Nexigents newly developed clinical trials service offerings into Covances
core business and reducing Nexigents infrastructure. Under the plan, certain of
Nexigents service offerings were to continue to be marketed by Covances core
business units. Covance recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge in the second
quarter of 2001, totaling approximately $82 million $50 million net of tax,
consisting of approximately $65 million in asset write-offs in June 2001, and
approximately $16 million in severance and related benefits in connection with the
elimination of approximately 30 redundant Nexigent positions. Severance payments began
in August 2001 and continued through 2002. At December 31, 2002, there is no remaining
accrual on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2001, $07 million was
included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet. During
2000, primarily in order to restructure its Phase III clinical trials unit to align its
cost base with revenue projections, Covance announced plans to close certain satellite
offices, consolidate other facilities and eliminate approximately 200 positions
globally. In connection with these actions, Covance recorded a net pre-tax restructuring
charge of $125 million $76 million net of tax in 2000, consisting primarily of $51
million in lease termination and other facility related costs and $67 million
for severance and related benefits. As of December 31, 2001, these positions were
eliminated. Severance payments began in June 2000 and continue into 2003. At December
31, 2002, $02 million and $17 million, respectively, is included in accrued expenses
and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 12.Segment Information Covance
has two reportable segments: early development and late-stage development. Early
development services, which includes Covances preclinical and Phase I clinical
service capabilities, involve evaluating a new compound for safety and early
effectiveness as well as evaluating the absorption, distribution, metabolism and
excretion of the compound in the human body. It is at this stage that a pharmaceutical
company, based on available data, will generally decide whether to continue further
development of a drug. Late-stage development services, which include Covances
central laboratory, clinical development, commercialization and other clinical support
capabilities, are geared toward demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of a compound
in treating certain diseases or conditions, obtaining regulatory approval and maximizing
the drugs commercial potential. The
information provided below is on an as reported basis and has not been
restated to exclude the results of Biomanufacturing and Packaging, which were divested
during 2001. The information below also includes special charges and goodwill
amortization recorded during all periods presented. Certain of the information below has
been presented on a pro forma basis in Note 14. The
accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note
2. 44 COVANCE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
