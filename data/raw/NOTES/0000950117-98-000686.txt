A DEVELOPMENT STAGE ENTERPRISE
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION
Algos Pharmaceutical Corporation the 'Company', is engaged primarily in
the development of proprietary pain management pharmaceuticals. Since its
formation in January 1992, the Company has devoted a substantial portion of its
efforts to developing products, licensing technology, filing regulatory
applications and raising capital. The Company is subject to a number of risks
common to companies in similar stages of development including, but not limited
to, the lack of assurance of successful product development and regulatory
approval, the absence of manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities,
the risk of technological obsolescence, changes in pricing and customer demand
and the ability to obtain future financing.
In May 1996, the Company effected an 83-for-1 stock split in the form of a
stock dividend. All historical share and per share data have been restated to
reflect the stock split.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
DEVELOPMENT STAGE ENTERPRISE
The accompanying statements have been prepared in accordance with the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 7 Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises.'
CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH
The Company considers money market securities with maturities of three
months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. A bank certificate of
deposit that serves as collateral for an irrevocable letter of credit required
by the terms of the Company March 1997 lease agreement is included in
restricted cash.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET
Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets which range from three to seven years. Gains and losses on
depreciable assets retired or sold are recognized in the statement of operations
in the year of disposal. Repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as
incurred.
REVENUE
License fees are recognized as revenue when contract milestones are
attained or when otherwise earned in accordance with the terms of the underlying
agreements.

ALGOS PHARMACEUTICAL CORPORATION
A DEVELOPMENT STAGE ENTERPRISE
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes.' SFAS No. 109 requires recognition of deferred tax
assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the
differences are expected to reverse.
LOSS PER SHARE
The Company has adopted SFAS No. 128, 'Earnings Per Share', for the
calculation and presentation of net loss per common share. SFAS No. 128 requires
the presentation of basic and diluted per share amounts on a retroactive basis
for all periods presented. Basic per share amounts are calculated by dividing
the net loss applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted per share amounts are calculated
by dividing the net loss applicable to common stock by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding plus dilutive common share equivalents.
Since the Company incurred losses in all periods presented, options and warrants
to purchase 935,825, 1,049,165, and 1,028,405 shares of common stock that were
outstanding at December 31, 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively, 702,500 shares
of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock that were outstanding at December 31,
1995 and 100,000 shares of Convertible Series B Preferred Stock that were
outstanding at December 31, 1996 were not included in diluted per share
calculations, as their effect would be antidilutive.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
No. 130, 'Reporting Comprehensive Income', which establishes standards for
determining and reporting comprehensive income and its components. Comprehensive
income represents the change in net assets of a business enterprise as a result
of nonowner transactions. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 130 in the first
quarter of 1998.
The FASB has also issued SFAS No. 131, 'Disclosure about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information', and SFAS No. 132, 'Employers' Disclosures
about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits', which are effective in 1998.
These standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company
financial statements.
3. MARKETABLE SECURITIES
Marketable securities at December 31, 1997 include the following debt
securities:

6. INCOME TAXES
At December 31, 1997, the Company had available net operating loss
carryforwards and research and development credits for federal income tax
purposes of approximately $12,900,000 and $562,000, respectively, which expire
in the years 2009 through 2012. At December 31, 1997, the Company had available
net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credits for state
income tax purposes of approximately $13,000,000 and $425,000, respectively,
which expire in the years 1999 through 2004. The use of federal net operating
loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to limitations under section 382 of
the Internal Revenue Code pertaining to changes in stock ownership. Due to the
uncertainty of their realization, a full valuation allowance has been
established for the potential income tax benefit of net operating loss and
credit carryforwards and temporary differences. The increase in the valuation
allowance amounted to $906,300, $1,122,200 and $4,745,000 in 1995, 1996, and
1997, respectively. Deferred tax assets liabilities for federal and state

Rent expense for the Company office facilities amounted to $21,841 22,475 and $58,275 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1996, and 1997
respectively and $126,199 cumulatively from the date of inception.
The Company current lease agreement expires in April 1998 at which time
it intends to relocate its executive office. In March 1997, the Company entered
into a ten-year operating lease agreement for a building consisting of
approximately 21,000 square feet of office space expected to be completed in
April 1998. Effective upon completion of the building, minimum annual lease
payments under the lease will amount to approximately $269,000 per year for the
first five years and aggregate approximately $16 million in the second
five-year period. The agreement provides the Company with an option to extend
the lease term for an additional five-year period and an option to purchase the
building during the fourth or fifth year of the initial lease term.
RESEARCH CONTRACTS
The Company routinely contracts with universities, medical centers,
contract research organizations and other institutions for the conduct of
research and clinical studies on the Company behalf. These agreements are
generally for the duration of the contracted study and contain provisions that
allow the Company to terminate the study prior to its completion.
8. SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS
In June 1996, the Company entered into a license agreement with McNeil
Consumer Products Company, an affiliate of Johnson & Johnson, which provides
McNeil with exclusive worldwide marketing rights to certain of the Company
products under development. The Company received payments of $2,000,000 and
$1,000,000 in 1996 and 1997 respectively and may receive additional payments
based on the achievement of certain milestones. McNeil will be responsible for
substantially all of the remaining development costs of its licensed provides.
In addition, the Company will receive royalties based on sales of licensed
products, if any. The agreement may be terminated by McNeil upon 60 days notice.
In December 1996, the Company entered into a development and marketing
collaboration and license agreement with Interneuron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for
the development and commercialization of a product to treat acute migraine
headache. The agreement grants to Interneuron rights, co-exclusive with Algos,
to use Algos patents and know-how to manufacture and market the product. After
an initial stage of development in which it is expected that Interneuron
development costs will exceed those of Algos, the agreement provides that the
companies will generally share equally the remaining development costs,
including pre-clinical studies, clinical trials, and regulatory activities, and
similarly share in marketing and profits of the resulting product, if any. After
the initial stage of development, the agreement may be terminated by either
Company with the terminating party retaining an interest in a

resulting product, either in the form of a royalty on sales or the repayment of
certain of its development costs.
In 1996, the Company contributed certain intangible assets having no book
value to a newly formed company, U.S. Dermatologics, Inc. formerly PharmaDyn,
Inc., and received preferred stock with an aggregate stated value and
liquidation preference of $2,800,000, and all of the transferee common stock.
The common stock was subsequently distributed to the Company stockholders,
warrant holders and certain of its employees. The preferred stock provides for
an annual cumulative dividend of 30%, which may be paid in the form of cash or
common stock, and a share of other earnings. The preferred stock may be redeemed
for the stated value plus accrued dividends at any time at the transferee
option or at the Company option at the end of two years. The Company entered
into a Services Agreement with U.S. Dermatologics, Inc. to provide certain
consulting and administrative services for a transitional period. The Agreement
expires in June 1998. The Company charges for services provided through
December 31, 1997 amount to approximately $180,000 and are due in 1998. The
Company recorded no gain or recovery in connection with the transactions as
management believes that at the present time realization is not assured.
9. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
The Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of $01 par value per
share preferred stock with rights, preferences and limitations determined by the
Board of Directors of the Company, 100,000 of which have been designated Series

Preferred Stock in connection with an amendment to a license agreement with a
university and recorded an administrative expense of $915,000. In 1997, all

law firms that rendered various legal services to the Company. The Company
recorded charges of approximately $16,000, $443,000, and $165,000 in 1995, 1996,
and 1997 respectively, and $790,000 from the date of inception, for these

authorized but unissued or reacquired shares of Common Stock. Unless sooner
terminated by the Board of Directors, the 1996 Stock Option Plan will expire on
January 31, 2006. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has the

vesting period of options, and to take all other actions for the administration
of the 1996 Stock Option Plan. The 1996 Stock Option Plan permits the payment of
the option exercise price to be made in cash or by delivery of shares of Common
Stock valued at their fair market value on the date of exercise or delivery of
other property, or by a recourse promissory note payable to the Company, or by a
combination of the foregoing. The Company Board of Directors has authorized an
increase of 800,000 in the number of shares available under the 1996 Stock
Option Plan subject to shareholder approval.
The 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan the Director Plan covers
83,000 authorized but unissued or reacquired shares of Common Stock and is
intended to assist the Company in attracting and retaining qualified
non-employee directors. The Director Plan is administered by the Board of
Directors and provides for automatic grants of non-qualified stock options to
purchase 10,000 shares of Common Stock to each non-employee director at the time
of appointment or Election to the Board of Directors. The exercise price of the
options shall be the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of
grant. Each option shall generally become exercisable in cumulative annual
installments of one-third on each of the first three annual meetings of the
Company stockholders following the date of grant so long as the non-employee
director continues to serve as a director of the Company. In addition, each
non-employee director shall be granted an option to purchase 5,000 shares of
Common Stock on an annual basis. Unless sooner terminated by the Board of
Directors, the Director Plan will expire in 2006.
In 1994, 1995 and 1996, the Company also granted options under prior plans.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model for grants after the Company October 1996 initial public
offering of Common Stock and a minimum value method for prior grants. The
following weighted-average assumptions were used for grants in 1995, 1996, and
1997 respectively: no dividend yield for all years, risk-free interest rates of
60%, 62%, and 63%, expected lives of 10, 39, and 50 and expected
volatility of 55% in 1996 and 60% in 1997.
