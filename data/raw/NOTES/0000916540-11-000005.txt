Darling International Inc. We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Darling International Inc. andsubsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Darling International Inc. and subsidiaries as of January1, 2011 and January2, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January1, 2011, in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, Darling International Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January1, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated March2, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

Darling International Inc. We have audited Darling International Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January1, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Darling International Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys interna
l control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Darling International Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January1, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. In December2010, Darling International Inc. acquired Griffin Industries, Inc. Griffin and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of Darling International Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January1, 2011, Griffins internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $9248million and total revenues of $277million included in the consolidated financial statements of Darling International Inc. and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended January1, 2011. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Darling International Inc. also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Griffin. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated financial statements of Darling International Inc. and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index, and our report dated March2, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

a NATURE OF OPERATIONS Darling International Inc., a Delaware corporation Darling, and together with its subsidiaries, the Company, is a leading provider of rendering, cooking oil and bakery waste recycling and recovery solutions to the nation food industry.The Company collects and recycles animal by-products, bakery waste and used cooking oil from poultry and meat processors, commercial bakeries, grocery stores, butcher shops, and food service establishments and provides grease trap cleaning services to many of the same establishments.On December 17, 2010, Darling completed its acquisition of Griffin Industries Inc. and its subsidiaries Griffin pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 9, 2010 the Merger Agreement, by and among Darling, DG Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Darli
ng Merger Sub, Griffin and Robert A. Griffin, as the Griffin shareholders representative.Merger Sub was merged with and into Griffin the Merger, and Griffin survived the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Darling.The Company operates over 125 processing and transfer facilities located throughout the United States to process raw materials into finished products such as protein primarily meat and bone meal, MBM and poultry meal PM, tallow primarily bleachable fancy tallow, BFT, poultry grease PG, yellow grease YG, bakery by-products BBP and hides as well as a range of branded and value-added products.The Company sells these products nationally and internationally, primarily to producers of animal feed, pet food, fertilizer, bio-fuels and other consumer and industrial ingredients including oleo-chemicals, soaps and leather goods for use as ingredients in their products or for further processing.The Companys ope
rations are organized into three segments: Rendering, Restaurant Services and Bakery.For additional information on the Companys segments, see Note 18. b SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
1 Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
2 Fiscal Year The Company has a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest December 31.Fiscal years for the consolidated financial statements included herein are for the 52 weeks ended January 1, 2011, the 52 weeks ended January 2, 2010, and the 53 weeks ended January 3, 2009. 
3 Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all short-term highly liquid instruments, with an original maturity of three months or less, to be cash equivalents. 
4 Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers non-payment of trade accounts receivable owed to the Company.These trade receivables arise in the ordinary course of business from sales of raw material, finished product or services to the Companys customers.The estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the Companys bad debt experience, prevailing market conditions, and aging of trade accounts receivable, among other factors.If the financial condition of the Companys customers deteriorates, resulting in the customers inability to pay the Companys receivables as they come due, additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required. Page 72    DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 
5 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method. 
6 Long Lived Assets Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of assets:1 Buildings and improvements, 15 to 30 years; 2 Machinery and equipment, 3 to 10 years; and 3 Vehicles, 2 to 6 years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and expenditures for major renewals and improvements are capitalized. 
Intangible Assets Intangible assets with indefinite lives, and therefore not subject to amortization, consist of trade names acquired in the acquisition of Griffin.Intangible assets subject to amortization consist of:1 collection routes which are made up of groups of suppliers of raw materials in similar geographic areas from which the Company derives collection fees and a dependable source of raw materials for processing into finished products;2 permits that represent licensing of operating plants that have been acquired, giving those plants the ability to operate; 3 non-compete agreements that represent contractual arrangements with former competitors whose businesses were acquired;4 trade names; and 5 royalty, consulting and leasehold agreements.Amortization expense is calculated using 
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from:5-20 years for collection routes; 11-20 years for permits; 3-7 years for non-compete covenants; and 15 years for trade names.Royalty, consulting and leaseholdagreements are amortized over the term of the agreement. 
7 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed of The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset, or related asset group, may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows.Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group.If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, due to lower commodity markets and the loss of certain large raw material suppliers, the C
ompany performed testing of all its long-lived assets for impairment based on future undiscounted cash flows and concluded that its long-lived assets were not impaired.In fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 no triggering event occurred requiring that the Company perform testing of all of its long-lived assets for impairment. 
8 Goodwill Goodwill and indefinite lived assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.The Company follows a two-step process for testing impairment.First, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine whether an indication of impairment exists.If impairment is indicated, then the fair value of the reporting units goodwill is determined by allocating the units fair value of its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.The amount of impairment for goodwill is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its implied fair value. Page 73    DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued  In fiscal 2008, the fair value of the Companys reporting units containing goodwill did not exceed the related carrying values; consequently, the Company recorded an impairment of approximately $159 million for the year ended January 3, 2009.In fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010, the fair values of the Companys reporting units containing goodwill exceeded the related carrying value.Goodwill was approximately $3763 million and $791 million at January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010, respectively.See Note 6 for further information on the Companys goodwill. 
9 Environmental Expenditures Environmental expenditures incurred to mitigate or prevent environmental impacts that have yet to occur and that otherwise may result from future operations are capitalized.Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed or charged against established environmental reserves.Reserves are established when environmental impacts have been identified which are probable to require mitigation and/or remediation and the costs are reasonably estimable. 
10 Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method.Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company periodically assesses whether it is more likely than not that it will generate sufficient taxable income to realize its deferred income tax assets.In making this determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence and makes certain assumptions.The Company considers, among other things, its deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, its historical earnings and losses, current industry trends and its outlook for future years.Although the Company is unable to carryback any of its net operating losses, based upon recent favorable operating results and future projections, certain net operating losses can be carried forward and utilized and other deferred tax assets will be realized. 
11 Earnings per Share On January 4, 2009, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB authoritative guidance, which addresses determinations as to whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two-class method.Non-vested and restricted share awards granted to the Company employees and non-employee directors contain non-forfeitable dividend rights and, therefore, are considered participating securities. Basic income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares including non-vested and restricted shares outstanding during the period.Diluted income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased by dilutive common equivalent shares determined using the treasury stock method.

For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, 87,843, 32,000 and 24,000 outstanding stock options were excluded from diluted income per common share as the effect was antidilutive.For fiscal 2010 non-vested stock of 75,714 shares were excluded from diluted income per common share as the effect was antidilutive. 
12 Stock Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the share-based payments e.g., stock options and non-vested and restricted stock granted to employees or by incurring liabilities to an employee or other supplier a in amounts based, at least in part, on the price of the entitys shares or other equity instruments, or b that require or may require settlement by issuing the entitys equity shares or other equity instruments. Total stock-based compensation recognized in the statements of operations for the years ended January 1, 2011, January 2, 2010 and January 3, 2009 was approximately $28 million, $12 million and $11 million, respectively, which is included in selling, general and administrative costs, and the related income tax benefit recognized was approximately $11 million, $05 million and $03 million, respectively.See Note 12 for further information on the Companys stock-based compensation plans. The benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost are reported as a financing cash flow.For the year ended January 1, 2011 the Company recognized $02 million as an increase in financing cash flows and for the year ended January 2, 2010 the Company recognized less than $01 million of such tax expenses, which were recorded as a decrease in financing cash flows.For the year ended January 3, 2009, the Company recognized $23 million in such tax deductions, which were recorded as an increase in financing cash flows and a reduction in operating cash flows. 
13 Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
If it is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect on the financial statements of a condition, situation, or set of circumstances that exist at the date of the financial statements will change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events and the effect of the change would be material to the financial statements, the Company will disclose the nature of the uncertainty and include an indication that it is at least reasonably possible that a change in the estimate will occur in the near term.If the estimate involves certain loss contingencies the disclosure will also include an estimate of the probable loss or range of loss or state that an estimate cannot be made. Page 75    DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 
14 Financial Instruments The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.Based upon quoted market price the Company senior notes described in Note 9 has a fair value of approximately $2606 million compared to a carrying amount of $2500 million at January 1, 2011.The Companys term loans and revolver as described in Note 9 have a fair value based on rates the Company believes it would pay for debt of the same remaining maturity.The Companys term loan had a fair value of approximately $302 million compared to a carrying amount of $325 million at January 2, 2010.The carrying amount of the Comp
anys term loan and revolver approximates the fair value at January 1, 2011.The carrying amount for the Companys other debt is not deemed to be significantly different than the amount recorded and all other financial instruments have been recorded at fair value as disclosed in Note 15. 
15 Derivative Instruments The Company makes limited use of derivative instruments to manage cash flow risks related to interest expense, natural gas usage, diesel fuel usage and inventory.The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes.Interest rate swaps are entered into with the intent of managing overall borrowing costs by reducing the potential impact of increases in interest rates on floating-rate long-term debt.Natural gas swaps and options are entered into with the intent of managing the overall cost of natural gas usage by reducing the potential impact of seasonal weather demands on natural gas that increases natural gas prices.Heating oil swaps are entered into with the intent of managing the overall cos
t of diesel fuel usage by reducing the potential impact of seasonal weather demands on diesel fuel that increases diesel fuel prices.Inventory swaps and options are entered into with the intent of managing seasonally high concentrations of MBM, PM, BFT, PG, YG and BBP inventories by reducing the potential impact of decreasing prices.At January 1, 2011, the Company had natural gas swaps outstanding that qualified and were designated for hedge accounting as well as natural gas swaps, options and heating oil swaps that did not qualify and were not designated for hedge accounting. Entities are required to report all derivative instruments in the statement of financial position at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value i.e., gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, on the reason for holding the instrument. If certain conditions are met, entities may elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures to changes in fair value, cash flows or foreign currencies.If the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a compone
nt of other comprehensive income outside of earnings and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Any amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness as well as the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately. If the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change. 
16 Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue on sales when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss. Certain customers may be required to prepay prior to shipment in order to maintain payment protection against certain foreign and domestic sales. These amounts are recorded as unearned revenue and recognized when the products have shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss. The Company has formula arrangements with certain suppliers whereby the charge or credit for raw materials is tied to published finished product commodity prices after deducting a fixed processing fee incorporated into the formula and is recorded as a cost of sale by line of business. The Company recognizes revenue r
elated to grease trap servicing in the month the trap service occurs. Page 76    DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.

Based on the Company annual impairment testing at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 it was determined that goodwill was impaired due to lower commodity markets and the loss of certain large raw material suppliers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, which resulted in the Company recording an impairment charge of approximately $159 million based on future discounted net cash flows. The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the Company reporting units.In step one, the Company determined based on the discounted cash flows that one of the Company reporting units carrying value exceeded its fair value in fiscal 2008.In step two the Company is required to compute the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill and compare it against the actual carrying amount of goodwill for that reporting unit.This was determined in the same manner that goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined.That is the fair value of the reporting unit was allocated to all of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been a
cquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit determined in the first step was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. Page 81    DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued In fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010, the fair values of the Companys reporting units containing goodwill exceeded the related carrying value. NOTE 7. ACCRUED EXPENSES

Plan Assets The Company pension plan weighted-average asset allocations at January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010, by asset category, are as follows Page 95    DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.

Investment results are the most critical element in achieving funding objectives, while reliance on contributions is a secondary element. The investment guidelines are based upon an investment horizon of greater than ten years; therefore, interim fluctuations are viewed with this perspective.The strategic asset allocation is based on this long-term perspective.However, because the participants average age is somewhat older than the typical average plan age, consideration is given to retaining some short-term liquidity.Analysis of the cash flow projections of the plans indicates that benefit payments will continue to exceed contributions.The results of a thorough asset-liability study completed during 2008 reinforced the appropriateness of the Company target asset allocation ranges described herein. Based upon the plans time horizon, risk tolerances, performance expectations, asset class constraints and asset-liability study results, target asset allocation ranges are as follows 
Fixed Income 35% - 45 
Domestic Equities 45% - 55 
International Equities 7% - 13 The fixed income allocation is invested in corporate and government bonds primarily denominated in U.S. dollar, private and publicly traded mortgages, private placement debt and cash equivalents.The average maturity of these issues does not exceed ten years.The portfolio is expected to be well-diversified. The domestic equity allocation is invested in stocks traded on one of the U.S. stock exchanges.Securities convertible into such stocks, convertible bonds and preferred stock, may also be purchased.The majority of the domestic equities are invested in mutual funds that are well-diversified among growth and value stocks categorized in large, mid and small cap asset classes.By definition, small cap investments carry greater risk than large and mid cap, but also are expected to create greater returns over time than large and mid cap.By definition large cap investments carry less risk than small and mid cap, and are expected to return less than small and mid cap over time.By definition mid cap investments fall between small and large cap stocks concerning riskiness and expected re
turn.Small company definitions fluctuate with market levels but generally will be considered companies with market capitalizations between $300 million and $2 billion.The portfolio will be diversified in terms of individual company securities and industries.No individual equity or individual fixed income investment comprised more than 15% of the defined benefit plans' total assets excluding U.S. government issues. Page 96    DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued The international equity allocation is invested in companies whose stock is traded outside the U.S. and/or companies that conduct the major portion of their business outside of the U.S.The portfolio may invest in ADR.The emerging market portion of the international equity investment is held below 10% due to greater volatility in the asset class.The portfolio is well-diversified in terms of companies, industries and countries. All investment objectives are expected to be achieved over a market cycle anticipated to be a period of five to seven years.Reallocations are performed on a monthly basis to retain target allocation ranges.

either retirement plan shares or A-shares with no loads.The fair value of each mutual fund is based on the market value of the underlying investments. Contributions The Company funding policy for employee benefit pension plans is to contribute annually not less than the minimum amount required nor more than the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes.Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future. Page 97    DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued Based on current actuarial estimates, the Company expects to make payments of approximately $20 million to meet funding requirements for its pension plans in fiscal 2011.

Years 2016 2020 33,340 The Company participates in several multi-employer pension plans which provide defined benefits to certain employees covered by labor contracts.These plans are not administered by the Company and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts.Current information with respect to the Company proportionate share of the over-and under-funded status of all actuarially computed value of vested benefits over these pension plans' net assets is not available.The Company portion of contributions to these plans amounted to $29 million, $28 million and $28 million for the years ended January 1, 2011, January 2, 2010 and January 3, 2009, respectively. The Company participates in several multi-employer pension plans which provide defined benefits to certain employees covered by labor contracts.One multi-employer plan in which the Company participates gave notification of a mass withdrawal termination for the plan year ended June 30, 2007.In April 2008 the Company made a lump sum settlement payment to this multi-employer plan for approximately $14 million, which included a release for any future liability.In June 2009, the Company received a notice of a mass withdrawal termination and a notice of initial withdrawal liability from a multi-employer plan in which it participates.The Company had anticipated this event and as a result had accrued approximately $32 million as of January 3, 2009 based on the most recent information that was 
probable and estimable for this plan.The plan had given a notice of redetermination liability in December 2009.In fiscal 2010, the Company received further third party information confirming the future payout related to this multi-employer plan.As a result, the Company reduced its liability to approximately $12 million.In fiscal 2010, another underfunded multi-employer plan in which the Company participates gave notification of partial withdrawal liability.As of January 1, 2011, the Company has an accrued liability of approximately $11 million representing the present value of scheduled withdrawal liability payments under this multi-employer plan.While the Company has no ability to calculate a possible current liability for under-funded multi-employer plans that could terminate or could requireadditional funding under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the amounts could be ma
terial. NOTE 14. DERIVATIVES The Companys operations are exposed to market risks relating to commodity prices that affect the Companys cost of raw materials, finished product prices and energy costs and the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company makes limited use of derivative instruments to manage cash flow risks related to interest expense, natural gas usage, diesel fuel usage and inventory.The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes.Interest rate swaps are entered into with the intent of managing overall borrowing costs by reducing the potential impact of increases in interest rates on floating-rate long-term debt.Natural gas swaps and options are entered into with the intent of managing the overall cost of natural gas usage by reducing the potential impact of seasonal weather demands on natural gas that increases natural gas prices.Heating oil swaps are entered into with the intent of managing the overall cost of diesel fuel usage by reducing the potential impact of seasonal weather deman
ds on diesel fuel that increases diesel fuel prices.Inventory swaps and options are entered into with the intent of managing seasonally high concentrations of MBM, PM, BFT, PG, YG and BBP inventories by reducing the potential impact of decreasing prices.At January 1, 2011, the Company had natural gas swaps outstanding that qualified and were designated for hedge accounting as well as heating oil swaps and natural gas swaps and options that did not qualify and were not designated for hedge accounting. Page 98    DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued Entities are required to report all derivative instruments in the statement of financial position at fair value.The accounting for changes in the fair value i.e., gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, on the reason for holding the instrument.If certain conditions are met, entities may elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures to changes in fair value, cash flows or foreign currencies.If the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income outside of earnings and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction af
fects earnings.Any amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness as well as the ineffective portion of the gain or loss are reported in earnings immediately.If the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change. Cash Flow Hedges On May 19, 2006, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements that are considered cash flow hedges according to FASB authoritative guidance.Under the terms of these swap agreements, beginning June 30, 2006, the cash flows from the Companys $500 million floating-rate term loan facility under the former credit agreement had been exchanged for fixed-rate contracts that bear interest, payable quarterly.The first swap agreement for $250 million matured April 7, 2012 bearing interest at 542%, which does not include the borrowing spread per the former credit agreement, with amortizing payments that mirror the old term loan facility.The second swap agreement for $250 million matured April 7, 2012 bearing interest at 5415%, which does not include the borrowing spread per the former 
credit agreement, with amortizing payments that mirror the old term loan facility.The Companys receive rate on each swap agreement was based on three-month LIBOR.As a result of the Merger and entry into a new Credit Agreement the term loan that specifically related to these interest swap transactions was repaid.As such, the Company discontinued and paid approximately $20 million representing the fair value of these two interest swap transactions at the discontinuance date with the effective portion in accumulated other comprehensive loss to be reclassified to income over the remaining original term of the interest swaps. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company entered into natural gas swap contracts that are considered cash flow hedges.Under the terms of the natural gas swap contracts the Company fixed the expected purchase cost of a portion of its plants expected natural gas usage through the first quarter of fiscal 2010.As of January 1, 2011 these cash flow hedges have expired and settled according to the contracts. In fiscal 2010, the Company has entered into natural gas contracts that are considered cash flow hedges.Under the terms of the natural gas swap contracts the Company fixed the expected purchase cost of a portion of its plants expected natural gas usage through the second quarter of fiscal 2011.As of January 1, 2011, some of the contracts have expired and settled according to the contracts while the remaining contract positions and activity are disclosed below. The Company estimates the amount that will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss at January 1, 2011 into earnings over the next 12 months will be approximately $10 million.As of January 1, 2011, approximately $03 million of losses have been reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges.

At January 1, 2011, the Company had forward purchase agreements in place for purchases of approximately$68 million of natural gas and diesel fuel.These forward purchase agreements have no net settlement provisions and the Company intends to take physical delivery.Accordingly, the forward purchase agreements are not subject to the requirements of fair value accounting because they qualify as normal purchases as defined.

Page 101    DARLING INTERNATIONAL INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued NOTE 16. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK 
Concentration of credit risk is limited due to the Company diversified customer base and the fact that the Company sells commodities.No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys net sales in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008. NOTE 17. CONTINGENCIES The Company is a party to several lawsuits, claims and loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of its business, including assertions by certain regulatory and governmental agencies related to permitting requirements and air, wastewater and storm water discharges from the Company processing facilities. The Companys workers compensation, auto and general liability policies contain significant deductibles or self-insured retentions.The Company estimates and accrues its expected ultimate claim costs related to accidents occurring during each fiscal year and carries this accrual as a reserve until these claims are paid by the Company. As a result of the matters discussed above, the Company has established loss reserves for insurance, environmental and litigation matters.At January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010, the reserves for insurance, environmental and litigation contingencies reflected on the balance sheet in accrued expenses and other non-current liabilities for which there are no potential insurance recoveries were approximately $282 million and $156 million, respectively.The Company management believes these reserves for contingencies are reasonable and sufficient based upon present governmental regulations and information currently available to management; however, there can be no assurance that final costs related to these matters will not exceed current estimates.The Company believes that the likelihood is remote tha
t any additional liability from these lawsuits and claims that may not be covered by insurance would have a material effect on the financial statements. Lower Passaic River Area.The Company has been named as a third party defendant in a lawsuit pending in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Essex County, styled New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, The Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Agency and the Administrator of the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund, as Plaintiffs, vs. Occidental Chemical Corporation, Tierra Solutions, Inc., Maxus Energy Corporation, Repsol YPF, S.A., YPF, S.A., YPF Holdings, Inc., and CLH Holdings, as Defendants Docket No. L-009868-05 the Tierra/Maxus Litigation.In the Tierra/Maxus Litigation, which was filed on December 13, 2005, the plaintiffs seek to recover from the def
endants past and future cleanup and removal costs, as well as unspecified economic damages, punitive damages, penalties and a variety of other forms of relief, purportedly arising from the alleged discharges into the Passaic River of a particular type of dioxin and other unspecified hazardous substances.The damages being sought by the plaintiffs from the defendants are likely to be substantial.On February 4, 2009, two of the defendants, Tierra Solutions, Inc. Tierra and Maxus Energy Corporation Maxus, filed a third party complaint against over 300 entities, including the Company, seeking to recover all or a proportionate share of cleanup and removal costs, damages or other loss or harm, if any, for which Tierra or Maxus may be held liable in the Tierra/Maxus Litigation.Tierra and Maxus allege that Standard Tallow Company, an entity that the Company acquired in 1996, contributed to the discharge of the hazardous substances that are the subject of this case while ope
rating a former plant site located in Newark, New Jersey.The Company is investigating these allegations, has entered into a joint defense agreement with many of the other third-party defendants and intends to defend itself vigorously.Additionally, in December 2009, the Company, along with numerous other entities, received notice from the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA that the Company as successor-in-interest to Standard Tallow Company is considered a potentially responsible party with respect to alleged contamination in the lower Passaic River area which is part of the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site located in Newark, New Jersey.In the letter, EPA requested that the Company join a group of other parties in funding a remedial investigation and feasibility study at the site.As of the date of this report, the Company has not agreed to participate in the funding group.The Companys ultimate liability for investigatory costs,
remedial costs and/or natural resource damages in connection with the lower Passaic River area cannot be determined at this time; however, as of the date of this report, there is nothing that leads the Company to believe that these matters will have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operation.

ols and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on managements evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Internal Control over Financial Reporting. aManagements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f promulgated under the Exchange Act.Those rules define internal control over financial reporting as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that  Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company  Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and  Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2011. In making this assessment, the Company management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.

Griffin.The Company is currently in the process of integrating Griffin pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.The Company is evaluating changes to processes, information technology systems and other components of internal controls over financial reporting as part of its ongoing integration activities, and as a result, controls will be periodically changed.The Company believes, however, it will be able to maintain sufficient controls over the substantive results of its financial reporting throughout this integration process. Because of the size and complexity of Griffin and the timing of the acquisition, the internal controls over financial repo
rting of Griffin were excluded from managements assessment of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2011.Griffin attributed approximately $277 million of the Companys consolidated net operating revenues for the year ended January 1, 2011, and represented approximately $9248 million of the Companys consolidated total assets as of January 1, 2011.

eriod covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9.B OTHER INFORMATION None. Page 109    PART III
