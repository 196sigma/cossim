40  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies Rockwell Automation, Inc. the Company or Rockwell Automation is a leading global provider of industrial automation power, control and information solutions that help manufacturers achieve a
competitive advantage in their businesses. Basis of Presentation Except as indicated, amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto relate to our continuing operations.
In March 2006, we sold the assets of our ElectroCraft Engineered Solutions ElectroCraft business. ElectroCraft is
reported as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented. On
January31, 2007, we divested our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses to Baldor Electric Company Baldor. These were the principal businesses of our former Power Systems operating segment. These
businesses are reported as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned and controlled majority owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliates over which we have the ability to exert significant influence, but that
we do not control and are not the primary beneficiary of, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, our proportional share of the respective affiliate earnings or losses is included in other income in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations. Investments in affiliates over which we do not have the ability to exert significant influence are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. These affiliated companies are not material individually or in the
aggregate to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Use of Estimates The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. We use estimates in accounting for, among other items, customer returns, rebates and incentives; allowance for doubtful accounts; excess and obsolete inventory; share based compensation; acquisitions; product warranty
obligations; retirement benefits; litigation, claims and contingencies, including environmental matters, conditional asset retirement obligations and contractual indemnifications; and income taxes. We account for changes to estimates and assumptions
prospectively when warranted by factually based experience. Revenue Recognition For approximately 90 percent of our consolidated sales, we record sales when all of the following have occurred: an agreement of sale
exists; pricing is fixed or determinable; collection is reasonably assured; and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred, as may be required according to contract terms, or services have been rendered. We recognize revenue for software
products and related services in accordance with Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
41  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued  1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies Continued 
We recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as construction-type
contracts using either the percentage-of-completion or completed contract method of accounting. We record sales relating to these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and
reliably estimable; we use the completed contract method for all others. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using either ithe relationship between actual costs incurred and
total estimated costs at completion or iiunits-of-delivery. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified. We
record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified. We use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine
the existence of an agreement of sale. We use shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether
the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis, as well as the customers payment history. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales and the related costs are included in cost of sales in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations. Returns, Rebates and Incentives Our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on
the end user or original equipment manufacturer OEM customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product. We also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates, account
credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria. Certain distributors are offered a right to return product, subject to contractual limitations. We record accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at the time of sale based primarily on historical experience. Returns,
rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits. Rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided. Accruals are reported as a
current liability in our balance sheet or, where a right of set-off exists, as a reduction of accounts receivable. Taxes on Revenue Producing Transactions Taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue producing
transactions, including sales, value added, excise and use taxes, are recorded on a net basis excluded from revenue. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include time deposits and certificates of deposit with
original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Receivables We record allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of
past due balances and economic conditions. Receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $124 million at September30, 2007 and $112 million at September30, 2006. In 
42  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued  1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies Continued 
addition, receivables are stated net of an allowance for certain customer returns, rebates and incentives of $81 million at September30, 2007
and $85 million at September30, 2006. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out FIFO or average cost methods. Market is determined
on the basis of estimated realizable values. Property Property, including internal use software, is stated at cost. We calculate depreciation of property using the straight-line method over 15
to 40 years for buildings and improvements, 3 to 14 years for machinery and equipment and 3 to 10 years for computer hardware and internal use software. We capitalize significant renewals and enhancements and write off replaced units. We expense
maintenance and repairs, as well as renewals of minor amounts. Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets generally result from business acquisitions. We account for business acquisitions by allocating the
purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values; the excess of the purchase price over the allocated amount is recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets also include costs of software developed by our software business to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed, as
accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives to be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate an impairment may be present. Any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to results of operations. We perform an annual
impairment test during the second quarter of our fiscal year. We amortize customer relationships, computer software
products, technology and other intangible assets with finite useful lives on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 3 to 20 years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate the recoverability
of the recorded amount of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. An impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived
from an asset are less than its carrying amount. If we determine that an asset is impaired, we measure the impairment to be recognized as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. We report assets to be disposed of
at the lower of the recorded amount or fair value less cost to sell. We determine fair value using a discounted future cash flow analysis. Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative financial instruments in the form
of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks. We use foreign currency forward 
43  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued  1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies Continued 
exchange contracts to offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next three
years cash flow hedges and changes in the fair value of certain assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies. We sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to
manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt. Our accounting method for derivative financial instruments is based upon the designation of such instruments as hedges under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. It is our
policy to execute such instruments with creditworthy banks and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. All foreign currency forward exchange contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.
Foreign Currency Translation We translate assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars using exchange rates at the end
of the respective period. We translate sales, costs and expenses at average exchange rates effective during the respective period. We report foreign currency translation adjustments as a component of other comprehensive income. Currency transaction
gains and losses are included in the results of operations in the period incurred. Research and Development Expenses
We expense research and development RD costs as incurred; these costs were $1431 million in 2007, $1485
million in 2006 and $1280 million in 2005. We include RD expenses in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Income Taxes We record a liability for income tax exposures when they are probable
and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Tax benefits related to claims are also recognized when they become probable and reasonably estimable. When determining the probability and the estimability of the liability or tax benefit, we consider the
relevant tax law as applied to us by the particular country, state, or other taxing authority. Earnings Per Share 
We present basic and diluted earnings per share EPS amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS amounts are based upon the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the year. We use the treasury stock method to calculate
the effect of outstanding share-based compensation awards, which requires us to compute total employee proceeds as the sum of athe amount the employee must pay upon exercise of the award, bthe amount of unearned share-based
compensation costs attributed to future services and cthe amount of tax benefits, if any, that would be credited to additional paid-in capital assuming exercise of the award. Share-based compensation awards for which the total employee
proceeds of the award exceed the average market price of the same award over the period have an antidilutive effect on EPS, and accordingly, we exclude them from the calculation. Antidilutive share-based compensation awards for the years ended
September30, 2007 1,385,840 shares, 2006 905,455 shares and 2005 20,013 shares were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.

1872 Share-Based Compensation Effective October1, 2005, we adopted SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective
application transition method. We recognize share-based compensation expense on grants of share-based compensation awards generally on a straight-line basis over the service period of each award recipient. See Note 11 for additional information.
SFAS 123R requires us to report the tax benefit from the tax deduction related to share-based compensation that is in excess of recognized compensation costs excess tax benefits as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow.
Prior to 2006 and the adoption of SFAS 123R, we reported the entire tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options as an operating cash flow. Product and Workers Compensation Liabilities We record accruals for product
and workers compensation claims in the period in which they are probable and reasonably estimable. Our principal self-insurance programs include product liability and workers compensation where we self-insure up to a specified dollar
amount. Claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies purchased from commercial insurers. We estimate the liability for the majority of the self-insured claims using our claims experience for the periods being valued.
Environmental Matters We record accruals for environmental matters in the period in which our responsibility is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. We make changes to the accruals in the periods in which the estimated costs
of remediation change. At environmental sites for which more than one potentially responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an
estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. At environmental sites for which we are the only responsible party, we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation. We do not
discount to their present value future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations. If we determine that recovery from insurers or other third parties is probable, we record a receivable for the estimated recovery. Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations We account for conditional asset retirement obligations under Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations FIN 47. We accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal operation of the long-lived asset.
The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional. See Note 17 for more information related to these obligations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB
Statements No87, 88, 106 and 132R SFAS 158, became effective for us as of September30, 2007. SFAS 158 requires us to recognize an asset or liability in our consolidated balance sheet reflecting the funded status of pension and
other postretirement benefit plans with current-year changes in the funded status recognized in shareowners equity. SFAS 158 did not change the existing criteria for measurement of periodic benefit costs, plan assets or benefit obligations.
Additionally, SFAS 158 requires us to measure the funded status as of the date of the Consolidated Balance Sheet by September30, 2009. Had we not been required to adopt SFAS 158 at September30, 2007, we would have recognized an
additional minimum pension liability pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No87, Employers Accounting for Pensions SFAS 87. The effect of recognizing the additional minimum pension liability is included in the table below in the
column labeled Prior to Adopting SFAS 158.

In June 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No06-11,
Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards EITF 06-11. EITF 06-11 specifies how companies should recognize the income tax benefit received on dividends that are apaid to employees holding
equity-classified nonvested shares, equity-classified nonvested share units, or equity-classified outstanding share options and bcharged to retained earnings under SFAS 123R. EITF 06-11 is effective for us beginning in 2009. We do not
believe EITF 06-11 will have a material effect on our financial statements and related disclosures. In February 2007, the
FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities SFAS 159. SFAS 159 permits companies to choose to measure at fair value many financial instruments and certain other items that are not
currently required to be measured at fair value. SFAS 159 is effective for us beginning in 2009. We do not believe SFAS 159 will have a material effect on our financial statements and related disclosures. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. It also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes information used in developing assumptions when pricing an asset or liability. SFAS 157 will be
effective for us beginning in fiscal 2009. We do not believe SFAS 157 will have a material effect on our financial statements; we will expand our disclosures in accordance with the requirements of SFAS 157 upon adoption. In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48, which became
effective for us on October1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income

taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Shareowners equity will decrease by up to $10 million as a result of the adoption of FIN 48 as of October1, 2008.  2.
Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisitions In 2007, our Control Products Solutions segment acquired
Industrial Control Services Group Limited, which does business as ICS Triplex, and ProsCon Holdings Ltd. ProsCon. The aggregate purchase price of these two acquisitions was approximately $2688 million in cash. ICS Triplex, headquartered in the United Kingdom and acquired in July 2007, is a leading global supplier of critical control and safety
solutions to process industries. It develops, delivers and maintains advanced products and solutions for high availability, fault-tolerant applications in process industry segments worldwide. It serves primarily the oil and gas, chemicals and power
generation industries. ProsCon is a process solutions systems integrator headquartered in Ireland that we acquired in
February 2007. Its areas of expertise include process technology and control systems and information technology, and it serves customers primarily in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. We recorded intangible assets of $1260 million resulting from the preliminary
purchase price allocations of the ICS Triplex and ProsCon acquisitions, which are pending the finalization of the intangible asset valuation and other matters. Intangible assets assigned include $527 million to customer relationships 12-year
weighted average useful life, $293 million to technology 10-year weighted average useful life, $145 million to other intangible assets 7-year weighted average useful life and $295 million to intangible assets not subject to amortization
related to the ICS Triplex trademark. We recorded a charge of $13 million during the fourth quarter of 2007 for in process research and development in cost of sales related to the
acquisition of ICS Triplex. We recognized goodwill of $1391 million related to these transactions, none of which is expected to be deductible for local tax purposes. We assigned the full amount of goodwill to our Control Products
Solutions segment. In May 2006, our Architecture Software segment acquired GEPA mbH, a provider of change
management software for industrial automation, process control and industrial information technology. In January 2006, our Control Products Solutions segment acquired Caribbean Integration Engineers, Inc. CIE. CIE offers engineering
services in control systems integration, process automation, computer system validation and IT solutions. Our Architecture Software segment also acquired Datasweep, Inc., a provider of production management software, in December 2005.
During 2006, in connection with the purchase price allocations of Datasweep, Inc., CIE and GEPA mbH, we recorded
intangible assets of $223 million, of which $108 million was assigned to technology and $41 million was assigned to customer relationships. The remainder is classified as other intangible assets. The results of operations of the acquired businesses have been included in our Consolidated Statement of Operations since the dates of
acquisition. Pro forma financial information and allocation of the purchase price is not presented as the individual effects of these acquisitions are not material to our results of operations and financial position.

Divestitures On January31, 2007, we divested our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses to Baldor.
These were the principal businesses of our former Power Systems operating segment. See Note 13 for more information. In
September 2006, we and Rockwell Collins, Inc. Rockwell Collins sold our investment in Rockwell Scientific Company LLC RSC for an aggregate of $1675 million in cash. Before the sale, we and Rockwell Collins each owned 50 percent of RSC. As part
of the transaction, among other things, we retained certain licenses for intellectual property owned by RSC. Additionally, we incurred expenses and funded certain RSC cash balances in connection with the sale, were obligated to pay to RSC $28
million in 2007 and are obligated to pay RSC $12 million in 2009. We recorded a gain on sale of $199 million $120 million after tax, or $007 per share in 2006. In March 2006, our Architecture Software segment sold the assets of our ElectroCraft Engineered Solutions business. See Note 13 for more information.  3.

conform to current year presentation. Computer software products amortization expense was $97 million in 2007, $118 million in 2006 and $118 million in 2005. The Allen-Bradley and
ICS Triplex trademarks have an indefinite life, and therefore are not subject to amortization. Estimated amortization expense is $343 million in 2008, $252 million in 2009, $169 million in 2010, $135 million in 2011, and $117 million in 2012. We performed the annual evaluation of our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment as required by SFAS No142,

debentures and 520% debentures in January 1998. The debt offering yielded approximately $7500 million of proceeds. We issued the 520% debentures at a discount, and the 615% notes and 670% debentures at par. In September 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap contract the Swap that effectively converted our $3500 million aggregate
principal amount of 615% notes, payable in 2008, to floating rate debt based on six-month LIBOR. The floating rate was 780 percent at September30, 2007 and 802 percent at September30, 2006. As permitted by SFAS No133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133, as amended, we have designated the Swap as a fair value hedge. Accordingly, the fair value of the Swap was recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the underlying debt at September30, 2007 and 2006. The fair value of the Swap, based upon quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities, was a liability of $18
million at September30, 2007 and a liability of $68 million at September30, 2006. On October26, 2004,
we entered into a five-year $6000 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Our $6000 million credit facility remains in effect and we have not drawn down under it at September30, 2007 or 2006. Borrowings under our credit facility bear
interest based on short-term money market rates in effect during

the period the borrowings are outstanding. The terms of our credit facility contain covenants under which we would be in default if our debt-to-total-capital
ratio was to exceed 60 percent. We were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facility at September30, 2007 and 2006. In addition to our $6000 million credit facility, short-term unsecured credit facilities of approximately $1723
million at September30, 2007 were available to foreign subsidiaries. On September29, 2006, we entered into a
364-day $2500 million unsecured revolving credit facility. We terminated this facility effective March30, 2007, as we no longer considered the liquidity provided by this facility to be necessary. There were no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements under any of our credit facilities. Borrowings under our
credit facilities during 2007 and 2006 were not significant. Our short-term debt obligations primarily relate to
commercial paper borrowings. Commercial paper borrowings outstanding were $1730 million at September30, 2007 and $2190 million at September30, 2006. At September30, 2007 the weighted average interest rate and original maturity
period of the commercial paper outstanding were 51 percent and three days, respectively. At September30, 2006 the weighted average interest rate and original maturity period of the commercial paper outstanding were 54 percent and three days,
respectively. Interest payments were $643 million during 2007, $586 million during 2006 and $456 million during 2005.

Product Warranty Obligations We record a liability for product warranty obligations at the time of sale to a customer based upon historical warranty experience. Most of our products are covered under a warranty period that runs for twelve months
from either the date of sale or from installation to an end-user or OEM customer. We also record a liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and reasonably estimable. Our product warranty obligations are included in other
current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Financial Instruments Our financial instruments include long-term debt, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and an interest rate swap. The following is a summary of the carrying value and fair value of our financial instruments in

We base the fair value of long-term debt upon quoted market prices for the same or
similar issues. We base the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts on quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies at specified future dates at specified exchange rates. At September30, 2007 and 2006, we had outstanding foreign
currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts relating to the euro, British pound sterling, Swiss franc, Singapore dollar and South Korean won. The foreign currency forward exchange contracts are recorded in other current
assets in the amounts of $52 million as of September30, 2007 and $19 million as of September30, 2006 and other current liabilities in the amounts of $382 million as of September30, 2007 and $85 million as of September30,
2006. We have designated certain foreign currency forward exchange contracts related to forecasted intercompany transactions as cash flow hedges. The amount recognized in earnings as a result of the ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges was not
significant. We also hold financial instruments consisting of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term
debt. The carrying value of these assets and liabilities as reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate fair value.  10.
Shareowners Equity Common Stock At September30, 2007, the authorized stock of the Company
consisted of one billion shares of common stock, par value $100 per share, and 25million shares of preferred stock, without par value. At September30, 2007, 146million shares of common stock were reserved for various incentive
plans.

2007 and gains of $34 million $20 million after tax in 2006 were reclassified into earnings and offset gains and losses, respectively, on the hedged items. Approximately $138 million $85 million after tax of the net unrealized losses on cash
flow hedges as of September30, 2007 will be reclassified into earnings during 2008. We expect that these unrealized losses will be offset when the hedged items are recognized in earnings. Unrealized gains on investment securities includes unrealized income, net of tax, of $25 million in 2007, related to our investment in
Baldor common stock acquired in the sale of the principal businesses of our former Power Systems operating segment. The investment is recorded in other current assets as an available-for-sale security with a fair value at September30, 2007 of
$340 million.  11.
Share-Based Compensation Effective October1, 2005, we adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective application transition method. Before we adopted SFAS 123R, we accounted for share-based compensation in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Other than for restricted stock, no share-based employee compensation cost was reflected in net income before October1, 2005. SFAS 123R
requires us to report the tax benefit from the tax deduction related to share-based compensation that is in excess of recognized compensation costs excess tax benefits as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. Before
October1, 2005 we reported the entire tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options as an operating cash flow. 
53  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued  11.
Share-Based Compensation Continued 
During 2007 and 2006, we recognized $290 million and $255 million in share-based
compensation expense in income from continuing operations, respectively. The total income tax benefit related to share-based compensation recorded in continuing operations was $102 million during 2007 and $88 million during 2006. We recognize
compensation expense on grants of share-based compensation awards generally on a straight-line basis over the service period of each award recipient. As of September30, 2007, total unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based
compensation awards was $297 million, net of estimated forfeitures, which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of approximately 17 years. Our 2000 Long-Term Incentives Plan, as amended, authorizes us to deliver up to 24million shares of our common stock upon exercise of stock options, or upon grant or in payment of stock
appreciation rights, performance shares, performance units and restricted stock. Our 2003 Directors Stock Plan, as amended, authorizes us to deliver up to 05million shares of our common stock upon exercise of stock options or upon grant of
shares of our common and restricted stock. Approximately 49million shares under our 2000 Long-Term Incentives Plan and 04million shares under our 2003 Directors Stock Plan remain available for future grant or payment at
September30, 2007. We use treasury stock to deliver shares of our common stock under these plans. Our 2000 Long-Term Incentives Plan does not permit share-based compensation awards to be granted after November30, 2009. Stock Options We have granted non-qualified and incentive stock options to purchase our common stock under various incentive plans at prices equal to the fair market value of the stock on the grant dates. The exercise price for some options granted under
the plans may be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares. Stock options expire ten years after the grant date and vest ratably over three years. The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended September30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
$2002, $1767 and $1260, respectively. We estimated the fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model and the following assumptions:  2007 2006 2005 Average risk-free interest rate
459 435 359 Expected dividend yield
147 156 150 Expected volatility
031 032 031 Expected term years
54 53 50
The average risk-free interest rate is based on the five-year U.S. treasury
security rate in effect as of the grant date. The expected dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend as a percentage of the market value of our common stock as of the grant date. We determined expected volatility using a weighted
average of daily historical volatility 90 percent of our stock price over the past five years and implied volatility 10 percent based upon exchange traded options for our common stock. We determined that a blend of historical volatility and
implied volatility better reflects future market conditions and better indicates expected volatility than purely historical volatility. We determined the expected term of the stock options using historical data adjusted for the estimated exercise
dates of unexercised options.

Performance Share Awards Certain officers and key employees are also eligible to receive shares of our common stock in payment of performance share awards granted
to them. During 2007, we granted 99,300 performance share awards for which up to 198,600 shares of our common stock could be delivered in payment. In 2006, we granted 143,100 performance share awards for which up to 286,200 shares of our common
stock could be delivered in payment. Grantees of performance shares will be eligible to receive shares of our common stock depending upon our total shareowner return, assuming reinvestment of all dividends, relative to the performance of the
SP 500 over a three-year period. At September30, 2007 and September30, 2006, performance share awards outstanding were 206,021 and 140,500, respectively. The per share fair value of performance share awards granted during the year ended September30, 2007 and September30, 2006 were $7224 and $6324, respectively, which we

The average risk-free interest rate is based on the three-year U.S. treasury

historical volatility for the period from November 2002 through November 2005 for the 2006 award and from November 2003 through November 2006 for the 2007 award. Restricted Stock We also grant restricted stock awards to
certain employees and members of the Board of Directors. Restrictions lapse over periods ranging from one to five years. We value restricted stock awards at the closing market value of our common stock on the date of grant.

over the vesting period. Stock options granted to retirement eligible plan participants who retire under our retirement plans on or after the first
anniversary of the grant date continue to vest post-retirement in accordance with plan provisions and agreements related thereto. If the plan participant retires less than twelve months from the grant date, the options under that grant are
forfeited. Stock compensation expense on grants to plan participants who are retirement eligible on the grant date or who will be retirement eligible in less than twelve months from the grant date is reported in pro forma net income over the twelve
month period from the grant date. We report stock compensation expense on grants to plan participants who become retirement eligible between twelve and thirty-six months after the grant date in pro forma net income over the period from grant date to
the retirement eligibility date.  12.
Retirement Benefits We sponsor funded and unfunded pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for our employees. The pension plans cover most of our employees and provide for monthly pension payments to eligible employees after retirement. Pension
benefits for salaried employees generally are based on years of credited service and average earnings. Pension benefits for hourly employees are primarily based on specified benefit amounts and years of service. Our policy with respect to funding
our pension obligations is to fund the minimum amount required by applicable laws and governmental regulations. We may, however, at our discretion, fund amounts in excess of the minimum amount required by laws and regulations, as we did in 2007 and
2006. Other postretirement benefits are primarily in the form of retirement medical plans that cover most of our United States employees and provide for the payment of certain medical costs of eligible employees and dependents after retirement.
Effective September30, 2007, we adopted SFAS 158. See Note 1 for the incremental effects of adoption of SFAS 158 on

the years ended September30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Also in 2007, we recognized a pension curtailment loss of $04 million, an other postretirement benefits curtailment gain of $451 million and an additional other postretirement
benefits settlement gain of $110 million related to the sale of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses that is reflected in income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations. In connection with the sale of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses, we retained the pension liability related to the eligible Power Systems participants in our U.S. Plan and Canada

postretirement net periodic benefit cost during the fiscal year ending September30, 2008. In 2005, we amended our
U.S. pension plan effective for 2006 to eliminate the early retirement subsidy for certain employees. The amendment reduced the pension obligation by approximately $70 million in 2005 and also reduced annual pension expense recognized over the
average remaining service life of plan participants. In 2007, 2006 and 2005 we voluntarily contributed $80 million 4500 million and $1500 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan trust. The accumulated benefit obligation for our
pension plans is $2,3164 million as of the 2007 measurement date and $2,1614 million as of the 2006 measurement date. We
use an actuarial measurement date of June30 to measure our benefit obligations, plan assets and to calculate our net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits.

The healthcare cost trend rate reflects the estimated increase in gross medical claims costs as required to be disclosed by SFAS No132, Employers
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. As a result of the plan amendment adopted effective October1, 2002, our effective per person retiree medical cost increase is zero percent beginning in 2005 for the majority of
our postretirement benefit plans. For our other plans, we assume gross healthcare cost trend rate will decrease to 550% in 2011.  2
Decreasing to 450% in 2012. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we equally consider the historical performance and the future expected performance for returns for each asset category, as well as the target
asset allocation of the pension portfolios. This resulted in the selection of the weighted average long-term rate of return on assets assumption. Our global weighted-average asset allocations at September30, by asset category, are:  Allocation Range

50%-80 63 65 62 Debt Securities
20%-50 36 34 37 Other
0%-20 1 1 1 The investment objective for pension funds related to our defined benefit plans is
to meet the plans benefit obligations, while maximizing the long-term growth of assets without undue risk. We strive to achieve this objective by investing plan assets within target allocation ranges and diversification within asset
categories. Target allocation ranges are guidelines that are adjusted periodically based on ongoing monitoring by plan fiduciaries. Investment risk is controlled by rebalancing to target allocations on a periodic basis and ongoing monitoring of
investment manager performance relative to the investment guidelines established for each manager. As of
September30, 2007 and 2006, our pension plans do not own our common stock. In certain countries in which we operate,
there are no legal requirements or financial incentives provided to companies to pre-fund pension obligations. In these instances, we typically make benefit payments directly from cash as they become due, rather than by creating a separate pension
fund.

We have a valuation allowance at September30, 2007 as noted above for
carryforwards for which future use is less than more likely than not. During 2006, the valuation allowance increased by
$70 million as a result of audit settlements and decreased by $272 million as a result of the planned utilization of capital loss carryforwards related to the sale of our investment in RSC and our sale of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric
motors and motor repair services businesses. We operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular
examinations by various U.S. Federal, state and foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods. Additionally, we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years. Our
income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction, the
differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or
assessments. Cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products,
services, and/or intellectual property as well as various U.S. state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax exposures. We regularly assess our position with regard to tax exposures and record liabilities for these uncertain tax
positions and related interest and penalties, if any, according to the principles of SFAS No5, Accounting for Contingencies. We have recorded an accrual of $1045 million and $851 million at September30, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, that reflects our estimate of the likely outcome of current and future audits. The accrual is recorded in other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The net change in the accrual of $194 million reflects a $262 million
reduction related to the combined closure of federal and state audits for the years 1998 through 2005, a $340 million increase related to discontinued operations, and an $115 million increase primarily related to current year taxes and interest on
previously identified income tax exposures. A final determination of these tax audits or changes in our estimates may result in additional future income tax expense or benefit.

United States income 5092 5096 5110
Non-United States income 2794 2262 1189 Total 7886 7358 6299 We have not provided U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative earnings of non-U.S.
affiliates that have been reinvested indefinitely. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and at September30, 2007, were approximately $8600 million. Because of the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits, it is not practicable to
determine the U.S. or state income tax liabilities that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely. Deferred taxes are provided for non-U.S. affiliates when we plan to remit those earnings. Income taxes paid were $4273 million during 2007, including $1900 million related to the gain on sale of our Dodge Mechanical and
Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses, $2147 million during 2006 and $1348 million during 2005.  17.
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities Environmental Matters Federal, state and local requirements relating to the
discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the environment have and will continue to have an effect on our manufacturing operations. Thus far, compliance with environmental
requirements and resolution of environmental claims have been accomplished without material effect on our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or financial condition. We have been designated as a potentially responsible party at 11 Superfund sites, excluding sites as to which our records disclose no
involvement or as to which our potential liability has been finally determined and assumed by third parties. We estimate the total reasonably possible costs we could incur for the remediation of Superfund sites at September30, 2007 to be $102
million, of which $32 million has been accrued. Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been asserted against
us alleging violations of federal, state and local environmental protection requirements, or seeking remediation of alleged environmental impairments, principally at previously owned properties. As of September30, 2007, we have estimated the
total reasonably possible costs we could incur from these matters to be $651 million. We have recorded environmental accruals for these matters of $266 million. In addition to the above matters, we assumed certain other environmental liabilities
related to Federal Pacific Electric, a former subsidiary of Reliance, in connection with the 1995 acquisition of Reliance, which we have retained following the sale of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services
businesses. We are indemnified by ExxonMobil Corporation Exxon for substantially all costs associated with these matters. The indemnity applies to liabilities for which we gave Exxon notice by December29, 2006. At September30, 2007, we
have recorded a liability of $230 million and a receivable of $217 million for these matters. We estimate the total reasonably possible costs for these matters to be $273 million for which we are substantially indemnified by Exxon. Based on our assessment, we believe that our expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with
present regulations governing environmental protection and other 
69  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued  17.
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities Continued 
expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position
or financial condition. We cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements. Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations Effective September30, 2006, we adopted FIN 47, which clarifies the guidance included in
SFAS No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143. Under FIN 47, companies must accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that results from the
acquisition, construction, development or the normal operation of the long-lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional. Identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and
previously divested facilities. We estimated conditional asset retirement obligations using site-specific knowledge and historical industry expertise. The application of FIN 47 resulted in a charge, net of tax, of $177 million included in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September30, 2006 as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. At September30, 2007, we have recorded liabilities for these asset retirement obligations of $53
million in other current liabilities and $218 million in other liabilities. We recorded $287 million in other liabilities for these obligations at September30, 2006. Pro forma amounts, as if FIN 47 had been applied for all periods, are in millions, except per share amounts:  2006 2005 Net income, as reported 6070 5400 Add: FIN 47 cumulative effect adjustment, net of tax 177 Less: FIN 47 depreciation and accretion expense, net of tax 10 09 Pro forma net income 6237 5391 Earnings per share Basic as reported 344 295 Basic pro forma 353 294 Diluted as reported 337 288 Diluted pro forma 347 288 Pro forma asset retirement obligation, end of period 287 271

Lease Commitments Rental expense was $977 million in 2007, $883 million in 2006 and $820 million in 2005. Minimum future rental commitments under
operating leases having noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year aggregated $2795 million as of September30, 2007 and are payable as follows in millions:  2008 707
2009 548
2010 357

Beyond 2012 708 Total 2795 Commitments from third parties under sublease agreements having noncancelable
lease terms in excess of one year aggregated $67 million as of September30, 2007 and are receivable through 2009 at approximately $31 million per year. Most leases contain renewal options for varying periods, and certain leases include
options to purchase the leased property. During 2006, we completed a sale-leaseback transaction of eight
properties, including the land, buildings and improvements affixed to the properties. The lease terms vary from five to fifteen years depending on the property and are classified as operating leases. The net proceeds on sale were approximately $899
million. Two of the sold properties resulted in a loss of $16 million that we recognized during 2006, with the remaining properties resulting in a gain on sale of $211 million that will be amortized to rent expense over the term of the respective
leases. The net book value of the sold assets has been removed from our balance sheet.  Other Matters
Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the
conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product liability, environmental, safety and health, intellectual property, employment and contract matters. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some
lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us, we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Like thousands of other companies, we including our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as
a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago. Currently there are thousands of claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants, together with hundreds of other companies. The great majority of
cases do not allege exposure to any asbestos-containing product that we or our predecessors manufactured or sold. In
addition, when our products appear to be identified, in some cases they are from divested businesses, and we are indemnified for most of the costs. However, we have agreed to defend and indemnify asbestos claims associated with products manufactured
or sold by our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses prior to their divestiture by us, which occurred on January31, 2007. But in all cases, for those claimants who do show that they worked with our
products or products of divested businesses for which we are responsible, we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses, in substantial part due to the integrity 
71  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued  17.
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities Continued 
of the products, the encapsulated nature of any asbestos-containing components, and the lack of any impairing medical condition on the part of many
claimants. We defend those cases vigorously. Historically, we have been dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants. We have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs, over and above self-insured retentions, for most of these claims. We initiated litigation in the Milwaukee County Circuit Court
on February12, 2004 to enforce the insurance policies against Nationwide Indemnity Company and Kemper Insurance, the insurance carriers that provided liability insurance coverage to our former Allen-Bradley subsidiary. As a result, the
insurance carriers have paid some past defense and indemnity costs and have agreed to pay the substantial majority of future defense and indemnity costs for Allen-Bradley asbestos claims, subject to policy limits. If either carrier becomes insolvent
or the policy limits of either carrier are exhausted, our share of future defense and indemnity costs may increase. However, coverage under excess policies may be available to pay some or all of these costs. The uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation and the long term solvency of our insurance companies make it difficult to predict
accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims. That uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process. Subject to these uncertainties and based on our
experience defending asbestos claims, we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In connection with the divestiture of our former aerospace and defense businesses the AD Business to The Boeing Company Boeing, we agreed to indemnify Boeing for certain matters related to operations of the
AD Business for periods prior to the divestiture. In connection with the spinoffs of our former automotive component systems business, semiconductor systems business and Rockwell Collins avionics and communications business, the spun-off
companies have agreed to indemnify us for substantially all contingent liabilities related to the respective businesses, including environmental and intellectual property matters. In conjunction with the sale of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses, we agreed to
indemnify Baldor for costs and damages related to certain legal, legacy environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses arising before January31, 2007, for which the maximum exposure would be capped at the purchase price. We estimate
the potential future payments we could incur under these indemnifications may approximate $325 million, of which $96 million has been accrued in other current liabilities and $161 million has been accrued in other liabilities at
September30, 2007. We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses. In connection with such
divestitures, lawsuits, claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses. In many countries we provide a limited intellectual property indemnity as part of our terms and conditions of sale. We also at times provide limited intellectual property indemnities in other contracts with third
parties, such as contracts concerning: the development and manufacture of our products; the divestiture of businesses; and the licensing of intellectual property. Due to the number of agreements containing such provisions, we are unable to estimate
the maximum potential future payments. However, we believe that future payments, if any, would not be material to our business or financial condition.  18.

76  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of Rockwell Automation, Inc. Milwaukee, Wisconsin We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of September30, 2007 and 2006, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareowners equity, cash flows, and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period ended September30, 2007. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index at a2.We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September30, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.As described in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at
Industrial Control Services Group Limited d/b/a ICS Triplex, which was acquired on July2, 2007, and whose financial statements constitute 13% and 7% of net and total assets, respectively, and 1% of net sales, and 0% of net income of the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September30, 2007. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at ICS Triplex. The Companys management is responsible for these
financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States.Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal 
77  
control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As described in Note 11 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, on October1, 2005, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No123R, Shared Based Payments. As described in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on September30, 2006,
the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. As described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on September30, 2007, the Company adopted Financial
Accounting Standard No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statements No87,88, 106, and 132R. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September30, 2007 and 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September30, 2007, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September30, 2007, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. /s/DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin November 15, 2007 
78  Item1B.Unresolved Staff Comments  None. 
9  Item2.Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness, as of September30, 2007, of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15e and Rule 15d-15e of the
Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September30, 2007. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15f under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based upon that evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as
of September30, 2007. On July2, 2007, we acquired Industrial Control Services Group Limited d/b/a ICS
Triplex, whose financial statements constitute 13 percent and 7 percent of net and total assets, respectively, 1 percent of net sales, and zero percent of net income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended
September30, 2007. We excluded ICS Triplex from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting at September30, 2007. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September30, 2007 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, as stated in their report that is included on the previous two
pages. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of the changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting As previously disclosed, we are in the process of developing and implementing common global process standards and an enterprise-wide
information technology system. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we implemented the manufacturing, logistics and non-manufacturing purchasing processes and functionality of the system to additional locations. In doing so, we modified and enhanced our
internal controls over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15f as a result of and in connection with the implementation of the new system and processes. We also implemented a pilot roll-out to one location of our
field support services. Additional implementations will occur to most locations of our company over a multi-year period, with additional phases scheduled throughout fiscal 2008-2010. There have not been any other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September30, 2007
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
