Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for specific financial information related to NSTARs electric utility and natural gas utility operations segments. 
In the second quarter of 2010, with the completion of the sale of MATEP, NSTAR changed its reportable segments and recast prior period information to
conform with the presentation that eliminates separate presentation of the Companys unregulated operations. Although the telecommunications and liquefied natural gas subsidiaries are separate legal entities, NSTAR has aggregated the results of
operations and assets of its telecommunications subsidiary with the electric utility operations, and aggregated the liquefied natural gas service subsidiary with gas utility operations. The telecommunications subsidiary, liquefied natural gas
service subsidiary and MATEP were previously aggregated as unregulated operations for purposes of segment reporting. Since the sale of MATEP, it is no longer necessary to present the unregulated segment separately due to immateriality. The new
segment presentation reflects the ongoing profile of NSTARs operations as primarily comprised of electric and gas utility operations. 
cNarrative Description of Business Principal Products and Services NSTAR Electric 
NSTAR Electric provides distribution and transmission electricity service at retail to an area of 1,702 square miles. The territory served is located in
Massachusetts and includes the City of Boston and 80 surrounding cities and towns, including Cambridge, New Bedford, Plymouth, and the geographic area comprising Cape Cod and Marthas Vineyard. The population of this area is approximately 25
million. NSTAR Electrics operating revenues and sales percentages by customer class for the years 2011, 2010, and 2009 consisted of the
following:  Revenues RetailElectricSalesmWh 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Retail Commercial and industrial 54 52 52 68 68 68 Residential 45 47 47 31 31 31 Other 1 1 1 1 1 1  5 Table of Contents
Regulated Electric Distribution Rates Retail electric delivery rates are established by the DPU and are comprised of:  a distribution charge, which includes a fixed customer charge and a demand and/or energy charge to collect the costs of building and expanding
the infrastructure to deliver power to its destination, as well as ongoing operating costs. The distribution charge also includes the recovery, on a fully reconciling basis, of certain DPU-approved safety and reliability programs costs, a Pension
and PBOP Rate Adjustment Mechanism PAM to recover incremental pension and pension benefit costs, a reconciling rate adjustment mechanism to recover costs associated with the residential assistance adjustment clause, a net-metering reconciliation
surcharge to collect the lost revenues and credits associated with net-metering facilities installed by customers, and an Energy Efficiency Reconciling Factor EERF to recover energy efficiency program costs and lost base revenues in addition to
those charges recovered in the energy conservation charge;  a basic service charge represents the collection of energy costs, including costs related to charge-offs of uncollected energy costs, through
DPU-approved rate mechanisms. Electric distribution companies in Massachusetts are required to obtain and resell power to retail customers through Basic Service for those who choose not to buy energy from a competitive energy supplier. Basic Service
rates are reset every six months every three months for large commercial and industrial customers. The price of Basic Service is intended to reflect the average competitive market price for electric power. Additionally, the DPU has authorized the
Company to recover the cost of its Dynamic Pricing Smart Grid Pilot Program through the Basic Service charge;  a transition charge represents the collection of costs to be collected primarily from previously held investments in generating plants and costs
related to existing above-market power contracts, and contract costs related to long-term power contracts buy-outs;  a transmission charge represents the collection of annual costs of moving the electricity over high voltage lines from generating plants to
substations located within NSTARs service area including costs allocated to NSTAR Electric by ISO-NE to maintain the wholesale electric market;  an energy conservation charge represents a legislatively-mandated charge to collect costs for energy efficiency programs; and
a renewable energy charge represents a legislatively-mandated charge to collect the costs to support the development and promotion of renewable
energy projects. Rate Settlement Agreement NSTAR Electric is operating under a DPU-approved Rate Settlement Agreement Rate Settlement Agreement that expires December31, 2012. From 2007 through 2012, the Rate Settlement Agreement
establishes for NSTAR Electric, among other things, annual inflation-adjusted distribution rates including a productivity offset, that are generally offset by an equal and corresponding adjustment to transition rates. Refer to the Rate
Settlement Agreement section of the accompanying Item7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for more details. Pursuant to a 2008 DPU order, Massachusetts
electric utilities must adopt rate structures that decouple the volume of energy sales from the utilitys revenues in their next rate case. The exact timing of the next rate case has not yet been determined. 
Massachusetts Regulatory Environment The
Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs oversees the Commonwealth Utilities Commission, consisting of three commissioners. The Commonwealth Utilities Commission leads the DPU, an agency that has jurisdiction over electric, natural gas, water,
and transportation matters. Massachusetts has joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a ten-state group that supports implementation of programs to reduce the production of greenhouse gases by electric power plants. 
6 Table of Contents
In July 2008, the Massachusetts Legislature enacted the Green Communities Act GCA energy policy
legislation designed: 1to substantially increase energy efficiency, 2foster the development of renewable energy resources and 3provide for a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in Massachusetts. 
In 2008, the Massachusetts Global Warming Solutions Act GWSA was enacted. In December 2010, a portfolio of policies designed to help reduce greenhouse
gas emissions was released by the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs. At this time, NSTAR cannot predict the effect of the GWSA on its future results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 
Refer to the Massachusetts Regulatory Environment section of the accompanying Item7, Managements Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for more details on the GCA and GWSA. Electric and Gas Rate Decoupling
On July16, 2008, the DPU issued an order to all Massachusetts electric and gas distribution utility companies that requires them
to develop plans to decouple their distribution rates/revenues from sales volumes. This action is intended to encourage utility companies to help their customers reduce energy consumption. Decoupling of rates will allow utility companies to carry
out the mandates of the GCA and at the same time collect the adequate level of revenues to maintain the quality and reliability of electric and gas services. This order allows companies to file for a revenue adjustment representing partial recovery
of lost base revenues caused by incremental energy efficiency spending until their decoupling rate plans are approved. Once decoupled rate plans are approved, revenues will be set at a level designed to recover the utility companies incurred
costs plus a return on their investment. This revenue level will be reconciled with actual revenues received from decoupled rates on an annual basis and any over or under collection will be refunded to or recovered from customers in the subsequent
year. NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas have not yet applied for decoupled rate structures. Sources and Availability of Electric Power Supply
For Basic Service power supply, NSTAR Electric makes periodic market solicitations consistent with DPU regulations. NSTAR Electric enters into
short-term power purchase agreements to meet its Basic Service supply obligation, ranging in term from three to twelve months. NSTAR Electric fully recovers its payments to suppliers through DPU-approved rates billed to customers. 
In accordance with the requirements of the GCA, in September 2010 NSTAR Electric along with other Massachusetts investor-owned utilities began to solicit
bids for renewable energy supplies for approximately 3% of total annual load for between 10 and 15 year periods. In August 2011, the DPU approved three long-term renewable energy purchase agreements, representing approximately 16% of NSTAR
Electrics load, originally executed in December 2010. These three contracts call for NSTAR Electric to purchase all of the output and associated renewable energy credits of three wind facilities to be constructed. At December31, 2011,
the estimated commitment associated with these new contracts is approximately $9 million in 2012, $30 million in each year 2013 2016, and $176 million in 2017 and beyond. Refer to Capital Expenditures and Contractual
Obligations in the Liquidity, Commitments and Capital Resources section of the accompanying Item7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for
more details. Market and Transmission Regulation NSTAR Electric and most other New England electric utilities, generation owners, and marketers are parties to a series of agreements that provide for coordinated planning and operation of the
regions generation and transmission facilities and the rules by which they participate in the wholesale markets and acquire transmission services. Under these arrangements, ISO New England Inc. ISO-NE, a non-profit corporation whose board of
directors and staff are independent from all market participants, serves as the Regional Transmission Operator 
7 Table of Contents
RTO of the New England Transmission System. ISO-NE works to ensure the reliability of the system, administers the Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff subject to FERC approval, intervenes
in pertinent regulatory proceedings, oversees the efficient and competitive functioning of the regional wholesale power market and determines which costs of NSTARs major transmission facilities are regionalized throughout New England. NSTAR
Electric is a New England Transmission Owner subject to FERC regulation and is a member of ISO-NE. Refer to the FERC Transmission ROE section of the accompanying Item7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for more details. Transmission Rates 
Transmission revenues are based on formula rates that are approved by the FERC. Tariffs are set by FERC and primarily include the Regional Network Service
RNS and Local Network Service LNS rate schedules. The RNS rate, administered by ISO-NE and billed to all New England distribution companies, is reset on June1 of each year and recovers the revenue requirements associated with transmission
facilities that benefit the New England region. The LNS rate, which NSTAR Electric administers, is reset annually and recovers the revenue requirements for local transmission facilities. The LNS rate calculation recovers total transmission revenue
requirements net of revenues received from other sources, thereby ensuring that NSTAR Electric recovers all regional and local revenue requirements as prescribed in the tariffs. Transmission Capital Improvements NSTAR Electric NSTAR Electric continues to evaluate
needs for transmission improvements throughout the NSTAR service area. ISO-NE transmission project upgrades maintain transmission system reliability, improve the economic performance of the system, and are fully coordinated with other power regions.
Over the next five to ten years, ISO-NE transmission projects are expected to enhance the regions ability to support a robust, competitive wholesale power market by reliably moving power from various internal and external sources to the
regions load centers. Additional transmission plans have been developed to further reduce the dependence on certain generating units
needed for reliability and the exposure to special load-shedding contingency procedures. At various times, generating units in New England have been in must-run situations to maintain area reliability. Transmission improvements placed
in-service have reduced costs associated with Reliability Must Run Agreements and second-contingency and voltage-control payments. The Lower
Southeastern Massachusetts SEMA Project consists of an expansion and upgrade of existing transmission infrastructure, and construction of a new 31 mile, 345kV transmission line that will cross the Cape Cod Canal. On December16, 2011, ISO-NE
issued formal approval for the Lower SEMA 345 kV Transmission Project to be included in the Pool Transmission Facility regional rates. At a hearing held on January12, 2012, the Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board EFSB voted
unanimously to direct the EFSB Staff to prepare tentative decisions for public comment based on the EFSBs approval of the project subject to the conditions of NSTAR Electric providing reports to the EFSB every six months on project costs and
schedule of construction. Further conditions may be imposed. The Cape Cod Commission CCC unanimously approved the project on January19, 2012. The cost estimate of this project is approximately $110 million; NSTAR Electric anticipates that
the project will be in-service in 2012 or early 2013 dependent on the timing of final regulatory approvals. NSTAR Transmission Ventures
NSTAR Transmission Ventures, Inc. NTV is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NSTAR. NTV holds a 25% interest in Northern Pass Transmission LLC
NPT. NPT is a joint venture of NSTAR and NU that plans to build a $11 billion, 1,200 megawatt transmission line from the Canadian border to Deerfield, New Hampshire. NSTAR Gas NSTAR Gas distributes natural gas to approximately 300,000 customers in 51
communities in central and eastern Massachusetts covering 1,067 square miles and having an aggregate population of 13 million. Twenty-five of 
8 Table of Contents
these communities are also served with electricity by NSTAR Electric. Some of the larger communities served by NSTAR Gas include the Hyde Park area of Boston, Cambridge, Dedham, Framingham, New
Bedford, Plymouth, Somerville, and Worcester. NSTAR Gas operating revenues and sales percentages by customer class for the years 2011,
2010, and 2009, consisted of the following:  Revenues RetailGasSalestherms 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Gas Sales and Transportation Residential 59 63 62 43 43 43 Commercial and Industrial 27 25 28 46 46 44 Other 5 5 5 6 6 6 Off-System and Contract sales 9 7 5 5 5 7 Gas Rates 
NSTAR Gas generates revenues primarily through the sale and/or transportation of natural gas. Gas sales and transportation services are divided into two
categories: firm, whereby NSTAR Gas must supply gas and/or transportation services to customers on demand; and interruptible, whereby NSTAR Gas may, generally during colder months, temporarily discontinue service to high volume commercial and
industrial customers. Sales and transportation of gas to interruptible customers have no impact on NSTAR Gas operating income because a substantial portion of the margin for such service is returned to its firm customers as rate reductions.
Retail natural gas delivery and supply rates are established by the DPU and are comprised of:  a distribution charge consists of a fixed customer charge and a demand and/or energy charge that collects the costs of building and expanding
the natural gas infrastructure to deliver natural gas supply to its customers destination. This also includes collection of ongoing operating costs;  a seasonal cost of gas adjustment clause CGAC represents the collection of natural gas supply costs, pipeline and storage capacity, costs
related to charge-offs of uncollected energy costs and working capital related costs. The CGAC is reset every six months. In addition, NSTAR Gas files interim changes to its CGAC factor when the actual costs of natural gas supply vary from
projections by more than 5%; and  a local distribution adjustment clause LDAC primarily represents the collection of energy efficiency program costs, environmental costs, PAM
related costs, and costs associated with the residential assistance adjustment clause. The LDAC is reset annually and provides for the recovery of certain costs applicable to both sales and transportation customers. 
NSTAR Gas purchases financial contracts based on NYMEX natural gas futures in order to reduce cash flow variability associated with the purchase price
for approximately one-third of its natural gas purchases. This practice attempts to minimize the impact of fluctuations in prices to NSTARs firm gas customers. These financial contracts do not procure gas supply. All costs incurred or benefits
realized when these contracts are settled are included in the CGAC. Gas Supply, Transportation and Storage 
NSTAR Gas maintains a flexible resource portfolio consisting of natural gas supply contracts, transportation contracts on interstate pipelines, market
area storage and peaking services. NSTAR Gas purchases transportation, storage, and balancing services from Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company
and Algonquin Gas Transmission Company, as well as other upstream pipelines that transport gas from major producing regions in the U.S., including Gulf Coast, Mid-continent, and Appalachian Shale supplies to the final
9 Table of Contents
delivery points in the NSTAR Gas service area. NSTAR Gas purchases all of its natural gas supply from a firm portfolio management contract with a term of one year, which has a maximum quantity of
139,606 MMBtu/day. In addition to the firm transportation and natural gas supplies mentioned above, NSTAR Gas utilizes contracts for
underground storage and LNG facilities to meet its winter peaking demands. The LNG facilities, described below, are located within NSTAR Gas distribution system and are used to liquefy and store pipeline gas during the warmer months for
vaporization and use during the heating season. During the summer injection season, excess pipeline capacity and supplies are used to deliver and store natural gas in market area underground storage facilities located in the New York and
Pennsylvania region. Stored natural gas is withdrawn during the winter season to supplement flowing pipeline supplies in order to meet firm heating demand. NSTAR Gas has firm underground storage contracts and total storage capacity entitlements of
approximately 79 Bcf. A portion of the storage of natural gas supply for NSTAR Gas during the winter heating season is provided by
Hopkinton, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NSTAR. The facilities consist of an LNG liquefaction and vaporization plant and three above-ground cryogenic storage tanks in Hopkinton, MA having an aggregate capacity of 30 Bcf of liquefied natural gas. The
Company also has access to facilities in Acushnet, MA that include additional storage capacity of 05 Bcf and additional vaporization capacity. 
Based on information currently available regarding projected growth in demand and estimates of availability of future supplies of pipeline natural gas,
NSTAR Gas believes that its present sources of natural gas supply are adequate to meet existing load and allow for future growth in sales. 
Franchises Through their charters, which are
unlimited in time, NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas have the right to engage in the business of delivering and selling electricity and natural gas within their respective service territories, and have powers incidental thereto and are entitled to all
the rights and privileges of and subject to the duties imposed upon electric and natural gas companies under Massachusetts laws. The locations in public ways for electric transmission and distribution lines and gas distribution pipelines are
obtained from municipal and other state authorities who, in granting these locations, act as agents for the state. In some cases the actions of these authorities are subject to appeal to the DPU. The rights to these locations are not limited in time
and are subject to the action of these authorities and the legislature. Under Massachusetts law, with the exception of municipal-owned utilities, no other entity may provide electric or gas delivery service to retail customers within NSTARs
service territory without the written consent of NSTAR Electric and/or NSTAR Gas. This consent must be filed with the DPU and the municipality so affected. Unregulated Operations NSTARs unregulated operations include telecommunications and
liquefied natural gas service. Telecommunications services are provided through NSTAR Com, which installs, owns, operates, and maintains a wholesale data transport network for other telecommunications service providers in the metropolitan Boston
area to deliver voice, video, data, and internet services to customers. Revenues earned from NSTARs unregulated operations accounted for less than 1% of consolidated operating revenues in 2011, 2010, and 2009. 
In December 2010, NSTAR Com entered into a six-year indefeasible right to use agreement relating to the remaining available capacity on its dark fiber
network. Effective January 2011, this agreement provides annual payments of $6 million in 2011, which will gradually escalate to $13 million in 2016. Separately, NSTAR Com entered into an option agreement with the same counterparty exercisable at
the end of the six-year term to extend the right to use agreement for a ninety-nine year period in exchange for a one-time lump-sum payment. 
Regulation NSTAR Gas, NSTAR Electric
and NSTAR Electrics wholly-owned regulated subsidiary, Harbor Electric Energy Company, operate primarily under the authority of the DPU, whose jurisdiction includes supervision over 
10 Table of Contents
retail rates for distribution of electricity, natural gas, and financing and investing activities. In addition, the FERC has jurisdiction over various phases of NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas
utility businesses, conditions under which natural gas is sold at wholesale, facilities used for the transmission or sale of that energy, certain issuances of short-term debt, and regulation of accounting. These companies are also subject to various
other state and municipal regulations with respect to environmental, employment, and general operating matters. Plant Expenditures and
Financings Regulated Utilities The most recent estimates of plant expenditures and long-term debt maturities for 2012 and the years
2013-2016 are as follows:  in millions
2012 2013-2016 Plant expenditures Electric 455 1,355 Gas 65 185 
520 1,540 
Long-term debt 450 352 
In the five-year period 2012 through 2016, plant expenditures are forecasted for system reliability and performance
improvements, customer service enhancements, and capacity expansion in NSTARs service territory. Of the $455 million planned electric expenditures for 2012, approximately $190 million is for transmission system improvements. The amounts stated
above exclude expenditures for NSTARs proposed transmission investment with Northeast Utilities as these costs will be incurred by NPT to hold those assets further discussed in the Northern Pass Transmission Project section
in Item7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Management
continuously reviews its capital expenditure and financing programs. These programs and, therefore, the estimates included in this Form 10-K are subject to revision due to changes in regulatory requirements, operating requirements, environmental
standards, availability and cost of capital, interest rates and other assumptions. Refer to the accompanying Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information preceding Item1, Business and the
Liquidity, Commitments and Capital Resources section of Item7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
Seasonal Nature of Business NSTAR
Electrics kilowatt-hour sales and revenues are typically higher in the winter and summer than in the spring and fall as sales tend to vary with weather conditions. NSTAR Gas sales are positively impacted by colder weather because a
substantial portion of its customer base uses natural gas for space heating purposes. Refer to the accompanying Selected Quarterly Consolidated Financial Data section in Item6, Selected Consolidated Financial
Data for specific financial information by quarter for 2011 and 2010. Competitive Conditions 
As a rate-regulated distribution and transmission utility company, NSTAR is not subject to a significantly competitive business environment. NSTAR
Electric and NSTAR Gas have the exclusive right and privilege to engage in the business of delivering energy services within their granted territory. Under Massachusetts law, with the exception of municipal-owned utilities, no other entity may
provide electric or natural gas delivery service to retail customers within NSTARs service territory without the written consent of NSTAR Electric and/or NSTAR Gas. Refer to the accompanying Franchises section of this
Item1 and to Item1A, Risk Factors for a further discussion of NSTARs rights and competitive pressures within its service territory. 
11 Table of Contents
Environmental Matters NSTARs subsidiaries are subject to numerous federal, state and local standards with respect to the management of wastes and other environmental considerations. NSTAR subsidiaries face possible
liabilities as a result of involvement in several multi-party disposal sites, state-regulated sites or third party claims associated with contamination remediation. NSTAR generally expects to have only a small percentage of the total potential
liability for the majority of these sites. Noncompliance with certain standards can, in some cases, also result in the imposition of monetary civil penalties. Refer to the accompanying Contingencies Environmental Matters
section in Item7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note P, Commitments and Contingencies,
for more information. Management believes that its facilities are in substantial compliance with currently applicable statutory and
regulatory environmental requirements. Number of Employees and Employee Relations 
At December31, 2011, NSTAR has approximately 3,000 employees, including approximately 2,100 of whom are represented by two labor unions covered by
separate collective bargaining contracts. Substantially all management, engineering, finance and support services are provided to the
operating subsidiaries of NSTAR by NSTAR Electric Gas. NSTAR has the following labor union contracts:  Union

Risk Factors NSTARs future
performance is subject to a variety of risks, including, but not limited to those described below. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Companys business could be harmed and the market price of NSTARs Common Shares could
decline. In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors. NSTARs electric and gas operations are highly regulated, and any adverse regulatory changes could have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations and its financial
position. NSTARs electric and gas operations, including the rates charged, are regulated by the FERC and the DPU. In addition,
NSTARs accounting policies are prescribed by GAAP, the FERC, and the DPU. Adverse regulatory changes in rates and accounting policies by a regulatory authority could have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations and its
financial condition. Potential municipalization or technological developments may adversely affect the Companys regulated
electricity and natural gas businesses. Under Massachusetts law, no other entity may provide electric or gas delivery service to
retail customers within NSTARs service territory without the written consent of NSTAR Electric and/or NSTAR Gas. One potential exception is municipalization, whereby a city or town establishes its own municipal-owned utility. Although there
have been no recent municipalization activities in Massachusetts, NSTARs operating utility companies could be exposed to municipalization risk, whereby a municipality could acquire the electric or natural gas delivery assets located in that
city or town and take over the customer delivery service, thereby reducing NSTARs revenues. Any such action would require numerous legal and regulatory consents and approvals. Municipalization would require that NSTAR be compensated for its
assets assumed. In addition, there is also the risk that technological developments could lead to more wide-spread use of distributed generation among NSTARs customer base reducing such customers use of NSTARs utility system.
Changes in environmental laws and regulations affecting NSTARs business could increase the Companys costs and could curtail
its activities. NSTAR and its subsidiaries are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations that are currently in effect,
including those related to the handling, disposal, and treatment of hazardous materials. Changes in compliance requirements or the interpretation by governmental authorities of existing requirements may impose additional costs, all of which could
have an adverse impact on NSTARs results of operations. The Company may be required to conduct environmental remediation
activities for power generating sites and potentially other unidentified sites. NSTAR is subject to actual or potential claims and
lawsuits involving environmental remediation activities for power generating sites previously owned and other potentially unidentified sites. NSTAR divested all of its regulated generating assets under terms that generally require the buyer to
assume all responsibility for past and 
13 Table of Contents
present environmental harm. Based on NSTARs current assessment of its environmental responsibilities, existing legal requirements and regulatory policies, NSTAR does not believe that its
known environmental remediation responsibilities will have a material adverse effect on NSTARs results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, discovery of currently unknown conditions at existing sites, failure of current
owners to assume responsibility, identification of additional waste sites or changes in environmental regulation, could have a material adverse impact on NSTARs results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
NSTARs electric and gas operations could face negative impact from terrorism, cyber attacks, sabotage, acts of war, or other catastrophic
events. NSTARs electric and natural gas delivery infrastructure facilities and the generation and transmission infrastructure
facilities of third parties could be direct targets of terrorism, cyber attacks, sabotage, or acts of war, etc. The costs to repair any damage to operating facilities from destructive events could be substantial. Such actions could also result in
political, economic and financial market instability, which could have a material adverse impact on the Companys operations. While it is not possible to predict the impact of a particular event of this type, the impact that any threat of
terrorism, cyber attack, act of war or other catastrophic event might have on the energy industry and on NSTARs business in particular could be material. Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or we are unable to protect the integrity and security of our customers information.
NSTAR operates in a highly regulated industry that requires and depends on the continued operation of sophisticated information
technology systems and network infrastructure. Systems-related problems could adversely affect our ability to provide electric and gas service to our customers. NSTAR maintains appropriate security measures around these systems and requires its
vendors to maintain appropriate security measures; but technology can be vulnerable to failures or unauthorized access. NSTARs systems and those of its vendors could fail or be compromised, resulting in disruptions in NSTARs ability to
deliver energy and provide customer service. NSTAR and its vendors take measures to protect nonpublic customer information such as personal
information, customer payment card and check information pursuant to Federal and state laws. Unauthorized compromises of such information or of NSTARs systems, particularly by those with malicious intent, could have a material adverse effect
on NSTARs ability to perform important business functions. Failure to maintain the security of our customers confidential information, or data belonging to us, could result in the deterioration of the confidence that our customers and
regulators have in us. This would subject us to potential litigation and liability, and fines and penalties, resulting in a possible material effect on NSTARs results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
NSTAR is subject to operational risk that could cause us to incur substantial costs and liabilities. 
NSTARs business, which involves the transmission and distribution of natural gas and electricity that is used as an energy source by customers, is
subject to various operational risks, including incidents that expose the Company to potential claims for property damages or personal injuries beyond the scope of NSTARs insurance coverage, and equipment failures that could result in
performance below assumed levels. For example, operational performance below established target benchmark levels could cause NSTAR to incur penalties imposed by the DPU, up to a maximum of two and one-half percent of transmission and distribution
revenues, under applicable Service Quality Indicators. Violations of standards of performance for emergency preparation and restoration of service for gas and electric customers could also result in DPU imposed penalties up to $20 million for any
related series of violations. Increases in interest rates due to financial market conditions or changes in the Companys credit
ratings, could have an adverse impact on NSTARs access to capital markets at favorable rates, or at all, and could otherwise increase NSTARs costs of doing business. NSTAR frequently accesses the capital markets to finance its working capital requirements, capital expenditures and to meet its long-term debt maturity obligations. Increased interest rates, or adverse
changes in the Companys 
14 Table of Contents
credit ratings or further deterioration in the availability of credit, would increase NSTARs cost of borrowing and other costs that could have an adverse impact on the Companys
results of operations and cash flows and ultimately have an adverse impact on the market price of NSTARs Common Shares. In addition, an adverse change in the Companys credit ratings could increase borrowing costs, trigger requirements
that the Company obtain additional security for performance, such as a letter of credit, related to its energy procurement agreements. Refer to the accompanying Item7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk, for a further discussion. NSTARs electric and gas businesses are sensitive to variations in weather and have
seasonal variations. In addition, severe natural events and disasters could adversely affect the Company. Sales of electricity and
natural gas to residential and commercial customers are influenced by temperature fluctuations. Significant fluctuations in heating or cooling degree-days could have a material impact on energy sales for any given period. In addition, extremely
severe storms, such as hurricanes and ice storms, could cause damage to NSTARs facilities that may require additional costs to repair and have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial
position. To the extent possible, NSTARs rate regulated subsidiaries would seek recovery of these costs through the regulatory process. 
An economic downturn, increased costs of energy supply and customers conservation efforts could adversely affect energy consumption and could
adversely affect the Companys results of operations. Energy consumption is significantly impacted by the general level of
economic activity and cost of energy supply. Economic downturns or periods of high energy supply costs typically lead to reductions in energy consumption and increased conservation measures. These conditions could adversely impact the level of
energy sales and result in less demand for energy delivery. A recession or a prolonged lag of a subsequent recovery could have an adverse effect on NSTARs results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 
The ability of NSTAR to maintain future cash dividends at the level currently paid to shareholders is dependent upon the ability of its
subsidiaries to pay dividends to NSTAR. As a holding company, NSTAR does not have any operating activity and therefore is
substantially dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries and from external borrowings at variable rates of interest to provide the cash necessary for repayment of debt obligations, to pay administrative costs, to meet contractual obligations that
may not be met by NSTARs subsidiaries and to pay common share dividends to NSTARs shareholders. Regulatory and other legal restrictions may limit the Companys ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from its subsidiaries.
These laws and regulations may hinder the Companys ability to access funds that NSTAR may need to make payments on its obligations. As the holding companys sources of cash are limited to dividends from its subsidiaries and external
borrowings, the ability to maintain future cash dividends at the level currently paid to shareholders will be dependent upon cash flows of NSTARs subsidiaries. NSTARs subsidiaries do have certain limitations that could impact the payment of dividends to the Holding company. Refer to the Sources of Additional Capital and Financial Covenant
Requirements section of the accompanying Item7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information. 
NSTARs electric and gas operations may be impacted if generation supply or its transportation or transmission availability is limited or
unreliable. NSTARs electric and natural gas delivery businesses are reliant on generation, transportation and transmission
facilities that the Company does not own or control. The Companys ability to provide energy delivery services depends on the operations and facilities of third parties, including the independent system operator, electric generators that supply
NSTARs customers energy requirements and natural gas pipeline operators from which 
15 Table of Contents
the Company receives delivery of its natural gas supply. Should NSTARs ability to receive electric or natural gas supply be disrupted due either to operational issues or to inadequacy of
transmission capacity, it could impact the Companys ability to serve its customers. It could also force NSTAR to secure alternative supply at significantly higher costs. Financial market performance and other changes may decrease the Companys pension and postretirement benefit plans assets and could require additional funding beyond historic levels.
A sustained decline in the global financial markets may have a material adverse effect on the value of NSTARs pension and
postretirement benefit plans assets. This situation may increase the Companys benefit plans funding requirements. 
NSTAR will be subject to various uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger with NU is pending that could adversely affect the
Companys financial results. As discussed above in the accompanying Item1 Business, NSTAR is party to a
Merger Agreement with NU. Before the merger may be completed, the parties must satisfy all conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including obtaining shareholder approval in connection with the proposed merger and receipt of various
regulatory approvals. It is possible that uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees, suppliers, customers and others may have
an adverse effect on NSTAR. These uncertainties may impair NSTARs ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause suppliers and others that deal with
NSTAR to seek to change existing business relationships. The pursuit of the merger and the preparation for the integration of the companies
may place a significant burden on NSTARs management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business and any difficulties encountered in the merger integration process could adversely affect
the Companys financial results. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts NSTAR, without NUs consent, from making certain
acquisitions and dispositions and taking other specified actions. Under certain conditions these restrictions may prevent the Company from pursuing certain acquisitions or dispositions and making other changes to NSTARs business prior to
completion of the merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. NSTAR may be unable to obtain the approvals required to complete the
merger in the anticipated time frame, or at all, or such approvals may contain material restrictions or conditions. The merger is
subject to the approval of various government agencies, including the DPU, PURA, FERC, and the U.S. Department of Justice. Such approvals may impose conditions on the completion, or require changes to the terms of the merger, including restrictions
on the business, operations or financial performance of the combined company. These conditions or changes could also delay or increase the cost of the merger or limit the revenues of the combined company. 
Failure to complete the merger with NU could negatively impact NSTARs future business and financial results. 
Satisfying the conditions of the Merger Agreement and completing the merger may take longer than expected and could cost more than NSTAR expects. NSTAR
must pay its own incurred costs related to the merger, including legal, accounting and other professional fees. NSTAR cannot make any assurances that it will be able to satisfy all the conditions to the merger or succeed in any litigation brought in
connection with the merger. If the merger with NU is not completed, the Companys financial results, share price and credit ratings may be affected. 
16 Table of Contents
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both NSTAR and NU, including the right to
terminate the Merger Agreement if the merger is not consummated on or before October16, 2011. On October14, 2011, in accordance with certain provisions of the Merger Agreement, as amended, NSTAR and NU exchanged mutual notices extending
the Merger Agreement to April16, 2012, the date after which either party has the option to terminate the Merger Agreement if the conditions precedent to closing have not then been satisfied. The Merger Agreement further provides that, upon
termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, NSTAR or NU may be required to pay to the other a termination fee of $135 million and reimburse the other party for expenses up to $35 million. 
If completed, the merger with NU may not achieve its intended results. NSTAR entered into the Merger Agreement with the expectation that the merger would result in various benefits. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties,
including whether NSTARs businesses can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs and decreases in the amount of expected revenues generated by the
combined company. Executive Officers of Registrant Identification of Executive Officers Listed below are the executive officers of the Company as

Properties NSTAR Electric properties
include an integrated system of transmission and distribution lines and substations, an interest in a jointly owned administration office building and other structures such as garages and service centers
17 Table of Contents
that are located in eastern Massachusetts. NSTARs high-voltage transmission lines are generally located on land either owned or subject to perpetual and exclusive easements in its favor.
Its low-voltage distribution lines are located principally on public property under permits granted by municipal and other state authorities. 
At December31, 2011, NSTAR Electrics primary and secondary distribution and transmission system consisted of 20,775 circuit miles of overhead
lines, 12,145 circuit miles of underground lines, 258 substation facilities and approximately 1,183,000 active customer meters. NSTAR
Gas principal natural gas properties consist of distribution mains, services and meters necessary to maintain reliable service to customers. In addition, it shares an interest in a jointly owned administration office and service building, and
owns three district office buildings and several natural gas receiving and take stations. As of December31, 2011, the gas system included approximately 3,154 miles of gas distribution lines, approximately 191,350 services and approximately
281,600 customer meters together with the necessary measuring and regulating equipment. In addition, Hopkinton owns a liquefaction and vaporization plant and above ground cryogenic storage tanks. NSTAR Gas and Hopkinton own a satellite vaporization
plant and above ground cryogenic storage tanks. Combined, the tanks have an aggregate storage capacity equivalent to 35 Bcf of natural gas. 
NSTAR Com owns 279 miles of fiber optic network that represents approximately 85,000 fiber miles of network. Item3.
Legal Proceedings In the normal course
of its business, NSTAR and its subsidiaries are involved in certain legal matters, including civil litigation, for which it has appropriately recognized legal liabilities. Management has reviewed the range of reasonably possible court-ordered
damages, settlement amounts, and related litigation costs legal liabilities that could be in excess of amounts recognized and amounts covered by insurance, and determined that the range of reasonably possible legal liabilities would not be
material. Based on the information currently available, NSTAR does not believe that it is probable that any such legal liabilities will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position. However, it is reasonably possible that additional
legal liabilities that may result from changes in circumstances could have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  Item1.

The weighted-average exercise price does not take into account deferred shares or performance units, which have no exercise price. 
The NSTAR 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan the 2007 Plan permits a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including stock options, deferred stock and
performance share units to be granted to key employees. The aggregate number of NSTAR Common Shares that have initially been authorized for issuance under the 2007 Plan is 35 million. The 2007 Plan limits the terms of awards to ten years and
prohibits the granting of awards beyond ten years after its effective date. Stock options and stock awards vest over a three-year period from the date of grant. Performance share units are granted at target, and the number of shares distributed at
the end of the three-year performance period are based on the Company total shareholder return and earnings per common share growth. The Executive Personnel Committee EPC of the Board of Trustees approves stock-based awards for executives.
However, the Chief Executive Officers CEO award must also be approved by the independent members of the Board of Trustees. The EPC and Board of Trustees established that the date of grant for annual stock-based awards under the 2007 Plan is
the date each year on which the Board of Trustees approves the CEOs stock award. Options are granted at the full market price of the NSTAR Common Shares on the date of grant. NSTAR did not grant stock options during 2011.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MDA 
Overview NSTAR or the Company is a
holding company engaged through its subsidiaries in the energy delivery business serving approximately 14million customers in Massachusetts, including approximately 11million electric distribution customers in 81 communities and
approximately 300,000 natural gas distribution customers in 51 communities. NSTARs retail electric and natural gas transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries are NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas, respectively. Harbor Electric Energy
Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NSTAR Electric, provides distribution service and ongoing support to its only customer, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. On June1, 2010, NSTAR completed the sale of its stock ownership interest
in its district energy operations business, Medical Area Total Energy Plant, Inc. MATEP. NSTAR also has unregulated subsidiaries in telecommunications NSTAR Com and liquefied natural gas Hopkinton. For segment reporting purposes, NSTAR has
aggregated the results of operations and assets of NSTAR Com with the electric utility operations and Hopkinton with gas utility operations. 
NSTAR consolidates two wholly-owned special purpose subsidiaries, BEC Funding II, LLC and CEC Funding, LLC. These entities were created to complete the
sale of electric rate reduction certificates to a special purpose 
22 Table of Contents
trust created by two Massachusetts state agencies. These financing transactions securitized the costs incurred related to the divestiture of generation assets and long-term power contracts. The
activities of a third special purpose subsidiary, BEC Funding LLC, were substantially completed as of March31, 2010 and the Company was dissolved on April14, 2010. NSTAR derives its operating revenues primarily from the sale of energy, distribution, transmission, and energy efficiency services to customers. NSTARs earnings are impacted by fluctuations in unit
sales of electric kWh and natural gas MMbtu, which have an effect on the level of distribution and transmission revenues recognized. In accordance with the regulatory rate structure in which NSTAR operates, its recovery of energy and certain
energy-related costs are fully reconciled with the level of energy revenues currently recorded and, therefore, do not have an impact on earnings. As a result of this rate structure, any variability in the cost of energy supply purchased will have an
impact on purchased power and transmission and cost of gas sold expenses, but will not affect the Companys net income as the Company recognizes a corresponding change in revenues. Pending Merger with Northeast Utilities On October16, 2010, upon unanimous approval
from their respective Boards of Trustees, NSTAR and Northeast Utilities NU entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger the Merger Agreement. The transaction will be a merger of equals in a stock-for-stock transfer. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at closing, NSTAR will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of NU. On March4, 2011, shareholders of each company approved the merger and adopted the Merger Agreement. Under the terms of the Merger
Agreement, NSTAR shareholders will receive 1312 NU common shares for each NSTAR common share that they own. Following completion of the merger, it is anticipated that NU shareholders will own approximately 56 percent of the post-merger company and
former NSTAR shareholders will own approximately 44 percent of the post-merger company. The post-merger company will provide electric and gas
energy delivery services through six regulated electric and gas utilities in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire serving nearly 35million electric and gas customers. Completion of the merger is subject to various customary
conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. Acting pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on October14, 2011, NU and NSTAR formally extended the date by which either party has the right to terminate the Merger
Agreement should all required closing conditions not be satisfied, including receipt of all required regulatory approvals, from October16, 2011 to April16, 2012. Regulatory Approvals on Pending Merger with Northeast Utilities Federal
On January4, 2011, NSTAR and NU received approval from the Federal Communications Commission. On February 10, 2011, the applicable
Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period expired. On July6, 2011, NSTAR and NU received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC. Consent of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC was received on December20, 2011.
Massachusetts 
On November24, 2010, NSTAR and NU filed a joint petition requesting the DPUs approval of their proposed merger. On March10, 2011, the
DPU issued an order that modified the standard of review to be applied in the review of mergers involving Massachusetts utilities from a no net harm standard to a net benefits standard, meaning that the companies must
demonstrate that the pending merger provides benefits that outweigh the costs. Applicable state law provides that mergers of Massachusetts utilities and their respective holding companies must be consistent with the public interest. The
order states that the DPU has flexibility in applying the factorsapplicable to the standard of review. NSTAR and NU filed supplemental testimony with the DPU on April8, 2011 indicating the merger could provide post-merger net savings of
approximately $784 million in the 
23 Table of Contents
first ten years following the closing of the merger and provide environmental benefits with respect to Massachusetts emissions reductions, global warming policies, and furthering the goals of
Massachusetts Green Communities Act. The DPU held public evidentiary hearings during July 2011. Upon conclusion of the public
evidentiary hearings on July28, 2011, the DPU issued a briefing schedule that arranged for a series of intervenor and NSTAR and NU briefs and reply briefs culminating in the delivery of the final NSTAR and NU reply briefs on September19,
2011. Subsequently, NSTAR and NU agreed to different intervenor motions to extend the briefing schedule, and the DPU consented to these motions. The final NSTAR and NU reply briefs were filed on October31, 2011. 
On July15, 2011, the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources DOER filed a motion for an indefinite stay in the proceedings. On July21,
2011, NSTAR and NU filed a response objecting to this motion. The DPU originally scheduled Oral Arguments for November17, 2011 regarding the DOERs Motion to Stay the proceeding, which were postponed during the fourth quarter of 2011
while NSTAR, NU and other parties made attempts to narrow and discuss the issues presented by the DOERs Motion to Stay. On January6, 2012, the Oral Arguments were conducted regarding the DOERs Motion to Stay. At the Oral Argument,
DOER withdrew its request for a fully adjudicated rate case, which would have required an extended stay of the proceeding. NSTAR and NU await approval of the merger from the DPU. 
Connecticut On
June1, 2011, the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority PURA, formerly the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control DPUC, issued a declaratory ruling stating that it lacked jurisdiction to review the NSTAR merger with
NU. On June30, 2011, the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel filed a Petition for Administrative Appeal in Connecticut Superior Court requesting that the Superior Court remand the decision back to the PURA with instructions to reopen the
docket and review the merger transaction. On January4, 2012, the PURA issued a draft decision in Docket No10-12-05RE01 that
revised its earlier declaratory ruling of June1, 2011, which had concluded it did not have jurisdiction to review the pending merger between NU and NSTAR. Following oral arguments on January12, 2012, the PURA issued its final decision on
January18, 2012 that concluded that NU and NSTAR must seek approval to merge from the PURA pursuant to Connecticut state law. On January19, 2012, NU and NSTAR filed their merger review application with the PURA. On January20, 2012,
the PURA issued a procedural schedule that includes a draft decision on March26, 2012 and a final decision on April2, 2012. New Hampshire On April5, 2011, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission NHPUC
issued an order finding that it does not have statutory authority to approve or reject the merger. Maine 
On May11, 2011, the Maine Public Utilities Commission issued an order approving the merger contingent upon approval by the FERC. The FERC approval
was received on July6, 2011. Sale of MATEP On June1, 2010, NSTAR completed the sale of its stock ownership interest in MATEP. NSTAR received $343 million in cash and the sale resulted in a non-recurring, after-tax gain of $1099 million,
including transaction costs, or $104 per share, for 2010. The proceeds from the sale were partially utilized to retire the $855 million of MATEPs long-term Notes, together with a retirement premium of $18 million. 
24 Table of Contents
Share Repurchase Program In connection with the sale of MATEP, NSTARs Board of Trustees approved a share repurchase program of up to $200 million of NSTAR Common Shares. 
On June3, 2010, NSTAR entered into a $125 million Accelerated Share Repurchase ASR program with an investment bank, which delivered 3,221,649
NSTAR Common Shares to NSTAR under the ASR. In the fourth quarter of 2010, upon settlement of the ASR, NSTAR recorded a final adjustment to
common equity for the termination of the ASR reflecting the receipt of approximately $23 million in cash from the investment bank. No additional shares were delivered to NSTAR at the conclusion of the ASR. The excess of amounts paid over par value
for the 3,221,649 Common Shares delivered was allocated between Retained earnings and Premium on common shares in the Consolidated Statements of Common Shareholders Equity. 
In conjunction with the announcement of the proposed NSTAR and NU merger, NSTAR elected to cease the remaining $75 million of purchases of Common Shares
that had been planned under the $200 million share repurchase program. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
NSTARs discussion and analysis of its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are based on the accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements required management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that require significant judgment and uncertainties, and potentially may result in
materially different outcomes under different assumptions and conditions. The accounting policies and estimates that are most critical to the reported results of operations, cash flows and financial position are described below. 
a.Revenue Recognition Electric
and gas revenues are based on rates approved by the DPU and the FERC. Revenues related to the sale, transmission and distribution of energy delivery service are generally recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers.
However, the determination of the sales to individual customers is based on systematic meter readings throughout a month. Meters that are not read during a given month are estimated and trued-up to actual use in a future period. At the end of each
month, aggregate amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. Unbilled electric revenue is estimated each month based on daily territory load
customer energy requirements, estimated line losses and applicable customer rates. Unbilled natural gas revenues are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated gas losses and applicable customer rates. Accrued unbilled revenues
recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December31, 2011 and 2010 were $508 million and $554 million, respectively. The level of revenues is subject to seasonal weather conditions. Electric sales volumes are typically higher in the winter and summer than in the spring or fall. Gas sales volumes are impacted by colder
weather since a substantial portion of NSTAR Gas customer base uses natural gas for heating purposes. As a result, NSTAR realizes a higher level of revenue during the summer and winter. NSTARs nonutility revenues are recognized when services are rendered. Revenues are based, for the most part, on long-term contractual arrangements. 
25 Table of Contents
b.Regulatory Accounting NSTAR follows accounting policies prescribed by GAAP, the FERC, and the DPU. In addition, NSTAR and its subsidiaries are subject to the accounting and reporting requirements of the SEC. As rate-regulated
companies, NSTARs utility subsidiaries are subject to the application of an accounting standard for rate-regulated entities, Accounting Standards Codification ASC 980, Regulated Operations. ASC 980 considers the effects of regulation
resulting from differences in the timing of their recognition of certain revenues and expenses from those of other businesses and industries. NSTARs distribution and transmission businesses are subject to rate-regulation that is based on cost
recovery and meets the criteria for application of ASC 980. This ratemaking process results in the recording of regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities including cost of removal based on the probability of current and future cash flows.
Regulatory assets represent incurred or accrued costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery from customers. Regulatory liabilities may represent collections from customers that have been deferred because they will be
expended in the future. NSTAR continuously reviews its regulatory assets to assess their ultimate recoverability within the approved regulatory guidelines. NSTAR expects to fully recover these regulatory assets in its rates. If future recovery of
any deferred costs ceases to be probable, NSTAR would be required to charge such deferred amounts to earnings. Impairment risk associated with these assets relates to potentially adverse legislative, judicial or regulatory actions in the future.
c.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits NSTARs annual pension and other postretirement benefits costs are dependent upon several factors and assumptions, such as but not limited to, employee demographics, plan design, the level of cash
contributions made to the plans, the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on the plans assets and health care cost trends. Changes in pension and PBOP assets and liabilities associated with these factors are not immediately recognized as pension and PBOP costs in the statements of income, but generally are recognized in
future years over the remaining average service period of the plans participants. However, these factors could have a significant impact on pension and postretirement assets or liabilities recognized. 
NSTARs Pension Plan and PBOP Plan assets are impacted by fluctuations in the financial markets. Fluctuations in the fair value of the Pension Plan
and PBOP Plan assets impact the funded status, accounting costs, and cash funding requirements of these Plans. The earnings impact of increased Pension and PBOP costs is substantially mitigated by NSTARs DPU-approved pension and PBOP rate
adjustment mechanism. Under the PAM, NSTAR recovers its pension and PBOP expense through a reconciling rate mechanism. The PAM removes the volatility in earnings that could result from fluctuations in financial market conditions and plan experience.
There were no significant changes to NSTARs pension and PBOP benefits in 2011, 2010, and 2009. As further described in Note I,
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the discount rate for NSTARs Pension Plan obligation was 452% and 530% at December31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. The discount rate for NSTARs PBOP obligation was 458% and 545% at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These discount rates align with market conditions and the cash flow projections of NSTARs pension and PBOP
obligations. The expected long-term rate of return on both pension plan and PBOP assets was 80% in 2011 and 2010 compared to 90% in 2009. Changes in these assumptions have an impact on reported pension and PBOP costs and obligations.

The following table reflects the projected benefit obligation and cost sensitivities associated with a
change in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage for continuing operations. Each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption.  in thousands Actuarial Assumption

Management evaluates the appropriateness of the discount rate through the modeling of a bond portfolio that approximates
the settlement of Plan obligations. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, NSTAR considers past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the Plan as well as the target allocation for the
investments over a long-term period. The expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets could vary from actual year-to-year returns. The actual allocation for investments may vary from the target allocation at any particular time. During 2011,
NSTAR contributed $125 million to the Pension Plan and $30 million to the PBOP Plan. In 2012, NSTAR expects to contribute $25 million to the Pension Plan and $30 million to the PBOP Plan. The Company is in compliance with the funding requirements of The Pension Protection Act PPA and the Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act WRERA as of December31, 2011. 
d.Uncertain Tax Positions 
Accounting for uncertain tax positions requires management to use judgment in assessing the potential exposure from tax positions taken that may be
challenged by taxing authorities. Management is required to assess the possibility of alternative outcomes based upon all facts available at the reporting date. These estimates could differ significantly from the ultimate outcome. For additional
information on uncertain tax positions and estimates used therein, refer to Income Tax Matters included in this MDA. 
Investments in Yankee Companies NSTAR
Electric has an equity ownership of 14% in Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company CY, 14% in Yankee Atomic Electric Company YA, and 4% in Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company MY, collectively, the Yankee Companies. CY, YA, and MY plant sites
have been decommissioned in accordance with NRC procedures. Amended licenses continue to apply to the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations ISFSI where spent nuclear fuel is stored at these sites. CY, YA, and MY remain responsible for the
security and 
27 Table of Contents
protection of the ISFSI and are required to maintain radiation monitoring programs at the sites. NU also owns direct interests in the three Yankee companies. Should the NSTAR-NU merger close, the
combined NSTAR and NU ownership would exceed 50% for CY and YA. Yankee Companies Spent Fuel Litigation 
NSTAR Electric is part owner of three decommissioned New England nuclear power plants, Connecticut Yankee CY, Yankee Atomic YA and Maine Yankee MY
the Yankee Companies. The Yankee Companies have been party to ongoing litigation at the Federal level with respect to the alleged failure of the Department of Energy DOE to provide for a permanent facility to store spent nuclear fuel generated
in years through 2001 for CY and YA, and through 2002 for MY DOE Phase I Damages. NSTAR Electrics portion of the Phase I judgments amounts to $48 million, $46 million, and $3 million, respectively. The case has been going through the
appeal process in the Federal courts, oral arguments were held in November 2011 and a final decision on this appeal could be received by May 2012. In 2009, the Yankee Companies also filed for additional damages related to the alleged failure of the DOE to provide for a permanent facility to store spent nuclear fuel generated in years after 2001 for
CY and YA and after 2002 for MY DOE Phase II Damages. Claim amounts applicable to Phase II for NSTAR Electric are $19 million, $12 million, and $17 million, respectively. NSTAR cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these pending decisions. However, should the Yankee Companies ultimately prevail, NSTAR Electrics share of the proceeds received would be refunded to its
customers. The accounting for decommissioning costs of nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred
many years in the future. Changes in these estimates will not affect NSTARs results of operations or cash flows because these costs will be collected from customers through NSTAR Electrics transition charge filings with the DPU.
Derivative Instruments Energy Contracts NSTAR Electric has determined that it is not required to account for the
majority of its electricity supply contracts as derivatives because they qualify for, and NSTAR Electric has elected, the normal purchases and sales exception. As a result, these agreements are not reflected on the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets. NSTAR Electric has a long-term renewable energy contract that does not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception and is valued at an estimated $34 million and $24 million liability as of December31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. NSTAR Electric has measured the difference between the cost of this contract and projected market energy costs over the life of the contract and recorded a long-term derivative liability and a corresponding long-term regulatory asset
for the fair value of this contract. Changes in the fair value of the contract have no impact on earnings. NSTAR Gas has only one significant
natural gas supply contract. This contract is an all-requirements portfolio asset management contract that expires in October 2012. The following costs were incurred and recorded to Cost of gas sold on the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Income:  YearsendedDecember31 in millions

Refer to the accompanying Item7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,
for a further discussion. 
28 Table of Contents
Natural Gas Hedging Agreements In accordance with a DPU order, NSTAR Gas purchases financial contracts based upon NYMEX natural gas futures in order to reduce cash flow variability associated with the purchase price for approximately
one-third of its natural gas purchases. This practice attempts to minimize the impact of fluctuations in prices to NSTARs firm gas customers. These financial contracts do not procure natural gas supply, and qualify as derivative financial
instruments. The fair value of these instruments is recognized on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as an asset or liability representing amounts due from or payable to the counter parties of NSTAR Gas, as if such contracts were settled
as of the balance sheet date. All actual costs incurred or benefits realized when these contracts are settled are included in the CGAC of NSTAR Gas. NSTAR Gas records a regulatory asset or liability for the market price changes, in lieu of recording
an adjustment to Other Comprehensive Income. These derivative contracts extend through April 2013. As of December31, 2011, these natural gas hedging agreements, representing fourteen individual contracts, hedged 11,450 BBtu. The settlement of
these contracts may have a short-term cash flow impact. Over the long-term, any such effects are mitigated by a regulatory recovery mechanism from these costs. The settlement of these financial contracts resulted in the following additional charges
that were recorded to Cost of gas sold on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income:  YearsendedDecember31 in millions
2011 2010 2009 Settlement of NSTAR Gas financial contracts 12 10 47
Asset Retirement Obligations and Cost of Removal The fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation ARO is recorded in the period in which it is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, NSTAR capitalizes the cost by increasing
the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, NSTAR
either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. The recognition of an ARO within NSTARs
regulated utility businesses has no impact on its earnings. For its rate-regulated utilities, NSTAR establishes a regulatory asset to recognize future recoveries through depreciation rates for the recorded ARO. NSTAR has certain plant assets in
which this condition exists and is related to both plant assets containing hazardous materials and legal requirements to undertake remediation efforts upon retirement. A recorded asset retirement cost liability approximates the current cost for NSTAR to liquidate its legal or contractual obligations to perform actions at some point after the retirement of an asset. The
following amounts were included in Deferred credits and other liabilities: Other on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets:  December31 in millions
2011 2010 Asset retirement obligation 35 34
For NSTARs regulated utility businesses, the ultimate cost to remove utility plant from service cost of removal
is recognized as a component of depreciation expense in accordance with approved regulatory treatment. The following amounts were based on the estimated cost of removal component in current depreciation rates and represent the cumulative amounts
collected from customers for cost of removal, but not yet expended:  December31 in millions

FASB/IASB ConvergencePotential Changes to GAAP 
The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board IASB together the Boards continue to review a number
of common subject matter areas in the long-term pursuit of compatible accounting standards. As part of that effort, the FASB has released a variety of proposed authoritative standards for comment, some of which are joint issuances with the IASB.
There are proposed changes to GAAP, such as in the areas of leases and revenue recognition, which in their currently proposed form, could impact the regulated utility industry. The proposed guidance on leases would require NSTAR as a lessee to record an asset and an offsetting liability in its Consolidated Balance Sheet for long-term contracts with respect to the right to use
property and equipment, transactions that are currently treated as operating leases. These changes could impact the calculated results of NSTARs debt to equity ratios, requirements under existing credit facilities and the timing of expense of
leases and the income statement captions the expense is recorded to. The proposed revenue recognition guidance could require increased disclosure with respect to some regulatory mechanisms that contain certain incentive-based revenues that have
become more prevalent in the utility industry. Rate and Regulatory Proceedings 
a.Rate Structures 
Rate Settlement Agreement NSTAR
Electric is operating under a DPU-approved Rate Settlement Agreement Rate Settlement Agreement that expires December31, 2012. From 2007 through 2012, the Rate Settlement Agreement establishes for NSTAR Electric, among other things, annual
inflation-adjusted distribution rates including a productivity offset, that are generally offset by an equal and corresponding adjustment to transition rates. The rates as of January1 were as follows: January1 2012 2011 2010 2009 Annual inflation-adjusted distribution rate SIP increase decrease 096 019 132 174 The adjustment increase will be 096% of the distribution rates, effective January1, 2012 representing
approximately $8 million during 2012. Due to low inflation factors and a productivity offset, there was a slight distribution rate reduction effective January1, 2011. Uncollected transition charges as a result of the reductions in transition
rates are deferred and collected through future rates with a carrying charge. The Rate Settlement Agreement implemented a 50% / 50% earnings sharing mechanism based on NSTAR Electrics distribution return on equity excluding incentives should
it exceed 125% or fall below 85%. Should the return on equity fall below 75%, NSTAR Electric may file a request for a general rate increase. NSTAR Electric did not exceed the 125%, or fall below the 85% distribution return on equity during
2011, 2010 or 2009. Pursuant to a 2008 DPU order, Massachusetts electric utilities must adopt rate structures that decouple the volume of
energy sales from the utilitys revenues in their next rate case. The exact timing of the next rate case has not yet been determined. Basic Service Rates Electric distribution companies in Massachusetts are required to obtain and
resell power to retail customers through Basic Service for those customers who choose not to buy energy from a competitive energy supplier. Basic Service rates are reset every six months every three months for large commercial and industrial
customers. The price of Basic Service is intended to reflect the average competitive market price for electric power. As of December31, 2011, customers of NSTAR Electric had approximately 42% of their load requirements provided through Basic
Service. NSTAR Electric fully recovers its energy costs through DPU-approved rate mechanisms. 
30 Table of Contents
Firm Natural Gas Rates In addition to delivery service rates, NSTAR Gas tariffs include a seasonal CGAC and a LDAC. The CGAC provides for the recovery of all gas supply costs from firm sales customers. The LDAC provides
for the recovery of certain costs applicable to both sales and transportation customers. The CGAC is filed semi-annually for approval by the DPU. The LDAC is filed annually for approval. In addition, NSTAR Gas is required to file interim changes to
its CGAC factor when the actual costs of gas supply vary from projections by more than 5%. Changes in the cost of gas supply have no impact on the Companys earnings due to the CGAC and LDAC rate recovery mechanisms. 
b.Service Quality Indicators SQI
are established performance benchmarks for certain identified measures of service quality relating to customer service and billing performance, safety and reliability and DPU Consumer Division statistics performance for all Massachusetts utilities.
NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas are required to report annually to the DPU concerning their performance as to each measure and are subject to maximum penalties of up to two and one-half percent of total transmission and distribution revenues should
performance fail to meet the applicable benchmarks. NSTAR monitors its service quality continuously, and if it is probable that a liability
has been incurred and is estimable, a liability is accrued. Any settlement or rate order that would result in a different liability level from what has been accrued would be adjusted in the period that the DPU issues an order determining the amount
of any such liability. NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas filed final performance reports for 2010 with the DPU on March1, 2011. The NSTAR
Gas report has been approved and the NSTAR Electric report is pending a decision. Based on the reports filed, no penalties were assessable for the performance year. NSTAR believes that NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas service quality performance levels for 2011 were not in a penalty situation. The final performance reports are expected to be filed with the DPU by
March1, 2012. c. Emergency Preparation and Restoration of Service for Electric Gas Customers 
Under Massachusetts law and regulation, the DPU has established standards of performance for emergency preparation and restoration of service for gas and
electric companies.As a remedy to violation of those standards, the DPU is authorized to levy a penalty not to exceed $250,000 for each violation for each day that the violation persists up to a maximum penalty of $20 million for any related
series of violations. NSTAR believes that it is not in a penalty situation with respect to the performance of NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas
during declared emergency events to date. d. Regulatory Matters 
Massachusetts Regulatory Environment In 2008, the Massachusetts Legislature passed the Green Communities Act GCA energy policy legislation designed to substantially increase energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy
resources in Massachusetts. Significant features of the GCA include:  Requires electric and natural gas distribution companies to file energy efficiency investment plans to include fully reconciling funding mechanisms and
incentives;  Requires utility distribution companies to undertake various Green programs, including the solicitation of bids for long-term renewable energy
procurement contracts; 
31 Table of Contents Increases Renewable Portfolio Standards and Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards for utilities and other electricity suppliers regarding the power
that they purchase. Requirements to purchase power from new renewable resources will increase in increments of 1%per year from 4% in 2009 to 15% in 2020, plus 1% per year thereafter. Requirements to purchase from alternative portfolio
resources will gradually increase from 1% in 2009 to 5% in 2020. By 2020, NSTAR Electric anticipates purchasing 271% of its power under these mandates, as compared to a total of 121% in 2009. 
The GCA allows for utilities to recover in rates the incremental costs associated with its various mandated programs. NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas are in
compliance with all requirements of the GCA. In 2008, the Massachusetts Global Warming Solutions Act GWSA was enacted.The GWSA
contains a framework for reducing greenhouse gas GHG emissions across the Massachusetts economy, ultimately mandating reductions of GHG emissions of 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, with intermediate goals for 2020, 2030 and 2040.In
2010, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs issued a policy directive establishing an intermediate goal of 25 percent for 2020.The GWSA identifies three major methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions,
which are:clean energy, energy efficiency, and reduced energy usage.However, the implementation details for the aggregate limit are not prescribed by the GWSA and are subject to further determination.The DPU has construed the GWSA
to require consideration of reasonably foreseeable climate change impacts, including additional greenhouse gas emissions in rendering its decisions.NSTAR cannot predict the effect of the GWSA on its future results of operations,
financial positions, or cash flows. Electric and Gas Rate Decoupling In 2008, the DPU issued an order to all Massachusetts electric and gas distribution utility companies that requires them to develop plans to decouple their rates/revenues from sales volumes in the
next general distribution rate proceeding occurring subsequent to the 2008 order implementing decoupling. This action is intended to encourage utility companies to help their customers reduce energy consumption. Decoupling of rates will allow
utility companies to carry out the mandates of the GCA and at the same time collect the adequate level of revenues to maintain the quality and reliability of electric and gas services. This order allows companies to file for a revenue adjustment
representing partial recovery of lost base revenues caused by incremental energy efficiency spending until their decoupling rate plans are approved. Once decoupled rate plans are approved, revenues will be set at a level designed to recover the
utility companies incurred costs plus a return on their investment. This revenue level will be reconciled with actual revenues received from decoupled rates on an annual basis and any over or under collection will be refunded to or recovered
from customers in the subsequent year. NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas have not yet applied for decoupled rate structures. DPU
Safety and Reliability Programs CPSL As part of the Rate Settlement Agreement, NSTAR Electric recovers incremental costs related to the
double pole inspection, replacement/restoration and transfer program and the underground electric safety program, which includes stray-voltage remediation and manhole inspections, repairs, and upgrades. Recovery of these Capital Program Scheduling
List CPSL billed costs is subject to DPU review and approval. From 2006 through 2011, NSTAR Electric has incurred a cumulative incremental revenue requirement of approximately $83 million, including $17 million incurred in 2011. These amounts
include incremental operations and maintenance and revenue requirements on capital investments. On May28, 2010, the DPU issued an order
on NSTAR Electrics 2006 CPSL costs recovery filing. The expected recovery amount did not vary materially from the revenue previously recognized. On October8, 2010, NSTAR Electric submitted a Compliance Filing with the DPU reconciling the
recoverable CPSL Program revenue requirement for each year 2006 through 2009 with the revenues already collected to determine the proposed adjustment effective on January 1, 2011. The DPU allowed the proposed rates to go into effect on that date,
subject to reconciliation of program costs. NSTAR cannot predict the timing of subsequent DPU orders related to 
32 Table of Contents
this filing. Should an adverse DPU decision be issued, it could have a material adverse impact on NSTARs result of operations, financial position, and cash flows. 
Basic Service Bad Debt Adder 
On July1, 2005, in response to a generic DPU order that required electric utilities in Massachusetts to recover the energy-related portion of bad
debt costs in their Basic Service rates, NSTAR Electric increased its Basic Service rates and reduced its distribution rates for those bad debt costs. In furtherance of this generic DPU order, NSTAR Electric included a bad debt cost recovery
mechanism as a component of its Rate Settlement Agreement. This recovery mechanism bad debt adder allows NSTAR Electric to recover its Basic Service bad debt costs on a fully reconciling basis. These rates were implemented, effective
January1, 2006, as part of NSTAR Electrics Rate Settlement Agreement. On February7, 2007, NSTAR Electric filed its 2006
Basic Service reconciliation with the DPU proposing an adjustment related to the increase of its Basic Service bad debt charge-offs. This proposed rate adjustment was anticipated to be implemented effective July1, 2007. On June28, 2007,
the DPU issued an order approving the implementation of a revised Basic Service rate. However, the DPU instructed NSTAR Electric to reduce distribution rates by the increase in its Basic Service bad debt charge-offs. Such action would result in a
further reduction to distribution rates from the adjustment NSTAR Electric made when it implemented the Settlement Agreement. This adjustment to NSTAR Electrics distribution rates would eliminate the fully reconciling nature of the Basic
Service bad debt adder. NSTAR Electric has not implemented the directives of the June28, 2007 DPU order. Implementation of this order
would require NSTAR Electric to write-off a previously recorded regulatory asset related to its Basic Service bad debt costs. NSTAR Electric filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the DPUs order on July18, 2007. On May28, 2010, the
DPU issued an order and reaffirmed that NSTAR Electric should reduce its distribution rates by the increase in its Basic Service bad debt charge-offs. On June18, 2010, NSTAR Electric filed an appeal of the DPUs order with the
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court SJC. In October 2010, the SJC allowed a stay of the DPUs order pending appeal. Briefs were filed during the summer of 2011 and oral arguments were held on December8, 2011. A decision by the SJC is
expected in the first half of 2012. As of December31, 2011, the potential pre-tax impact to earnings of eliminating the fully reconciling nature of the bad debt adder would be approximately $22 million. NSTAR cannot predict the exact timing of
this appeals process or the ultimate outcome. NSTAR Electric continues to believe that its position is appropriate and that it is probable upon appeal that it will ultimately prevail. FERC Transmission ROE NSTAR earns an 1114% ROE on local transmission facility investments. The
ROE on NSTARs regional transmission facilities is 1164%. Additional incentive adders are available and are decided on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the FERCs most recent national transmission incentive rules. The FERC may
grant a variety of financial incentives, including ROE basis point incentive adders for qualified investments made in new regional transmission facilities. A 100 basis point adder, when combined with the FERCs approved ROEs described above,
results in a 1264% ROE for qualified regional investments. The incentive is intended to promote and accelerate investment in transmission projects that can significantly reduce congestion costs and enhance reliability in the region. 
FERC Proceeding Regarding Base ROE of New England Transmission Operators On September30, 2011, the Attorney General of Massachusetts and other ratepayer advocates representing the six New England states, filed a complaint with the FERC seeking to reduce the 1114% base
return on equity Base ROE used in calculating formula rates for transmission service under the ISO-NE Open Access Transmission Tariff OATT. A change in the Base ROE would adversely impact the investor-owned utilities New England Transmission
Owners, or NETOs, including NSTAR Electric, that own transmission facilities within the footprint of ISO-NE, which serves as the regional transmission organization for New England. 
33 Table of Contents
On October20, 2011, NSTAR Electric along with the other NETOs, filed their response with the FERC. In
that response, the NETOs vigorously defended the appropriateness of the current FERC-approved Base ROE. The NETOs requested that the FERC summarily dismiss the complaint. Should any unfavorable ruling by FERC result in a reduction of the Base ROE,
the exposure would be limited to OATT rates assessed following the complaint date of September30, 2011. NSTAR cannot predict the timing or outcome of this proceeding. As of December31, 2011, NSTAR Electric has estimated that each 10 basis point change in the authorized base ROE would change annual earnings by approximately $05 million. 
e. Other Energy Efficiency Plans
NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas administer demand-side management energy efficiency programs. The Massachusetts Green Communities Act GCA
directed electric and natural gas distribution companies to develop three-year energy efficiency plans. The first three-year plan covering the period 2010 through 2012 was approved by the DPU and represents a significant expansion of energy
efficiency activity in Massachusetts. Like the historical programs, the current three-year plan includes financial incentives based on energy efficiency program performance. In addition, the DPU has stated that it will permit distribution companies
that do not yet have rate decoupling mechanisms in place to implement Lost Base Revenue LBR rate adjustment mechanisms in order to partially offset reduced distribution rate revenues as a result of successful energy efficiency programs.
During 2011, NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas recognized recoverable Energy Efficiency program expenses of $1145 million and $177 million,
respectively. In 2008, pursuant to the DPUs Guidelines relative to energy efficiency programs, it was contemplated that prior to the
conclusion of year two 2011of the first three-year program, each Massachusetts company that administers energy efficiency programs, including NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas, would submit mid-term modifications to their programs based on
customer participation and savings achieved. The NSTAR 2012 mid-term modifications were submitted to the DPU in late 2011 for approval. In 2012, NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas anticipate that their separate recoverable expenses, inclusive of program
administrator incentives, will be $227 million and $274 million, respectively. Northern Pass Transmission Project 
On October4, 2010, Northern Pass Transmission LLC NPT and H.Q. Hydro Renewable Energy, Inc. Hydro Renewable Energy, an indirect, wholly-owned
subsidiary of Hydro-Qubec, entered into a Transmission Service Agreement the TSA in connection with the Northern Pass Transmission project Northern Pass. NPT is a joint venture indirectly owned by NU and NSTAR, on a 75 percent and 25
percent basis, respectively. Northern Pass will be comprised of a new high voltage direct current HVDC transmission line from the Canadian border to Franklin, New Hampshire and an associated alternating current radial transmission line between
Franklin, New Hampshire and Deerfield, New Hampshire. Northern Pass will interconnect at the U.S.-Canadian border with a planned HVDC transmission line to be constructed in Qubec by Hydro-Qubec Transnergie, the transmission
division of Hydro-Qubec. Pursuant to the TSA, NPT will sell firm electric transmission rights to Hydro Renewable Energy over the
1,200 megawatt Northern Pass line for a forty-year term. The TSA was approved by the FERC on February14, 2011 without modification. NPT will charge cost-based rates to Hydro Renewable Energy under the TSA for firm transmission service using a
FERC-approved formula rate. The projected cost-of-service calculation includes a return on equity ROE of 1256 percent through the construction phase of the project, after which the ROE will be tied to the ISO-New England regional rate base ROE
which is currently 1114 percent plus 142 basis points. The TSA rates will be based on a deemed capital structure for NPT of 50 percent debt and 50 percent equity. During the development phase and the construction phase under the TSA, NPT will be
recording non-cash Allowance for Funds Used During Construction AFUDC earnings. 
34 Table of Contents
In October 2010, NPT filed the Northern Pass project design with ISO-NE for technical approval and filed a
Presidential Permit application with the U.S. Department of Energy DOE, which seeks permission to construct and maintain facilities that cross the Qubec and New Hampshire border and connect to the Hydro-Qubec Transnergie
facilities in Qubec. During March 2011, the DOE held public meetings in New Hampshire seeking public comment on Northern Pass. In response to concerns raised at those meetings, on April12, 2011, NPT revised its Presidential Permit
application with the DOE. On June 15, 2011, DOE indicated that the public scoping comment period will be extended at least 45 days past the date the alternative route proposal is filed. NPT is evaluating alternative routes and has secured some
properties whether by ownership or by negotiating rights of way. The extended route evaluation process is expected to result in the beginning
of construction in 2014, and a completion date in the fourth quarter of 2016. The revised timing is not anticipated to have a material impact on the project budget. The estimated project costs are approximately $11 billion. NSTARs 25% share
of the Northern Pass costs will total approximately $280 million. On March30, 2011, the New Hampshire House of Representatives approved
House Bill 648, which would preclude non-reliability projects, such as Northern Pass, from using eminent domain to acquire property for construction of transmission lines. On June2, 2011, the New Hampshire Senate voted to send House Bill 648
back to the Senate Judiciary Committee for further study. The New Hampshire Senate voted on January25, 2012 to approve a bill that precludes electric transmission projects that do not receive regional cost allocation from utilizing eminent
domain. The bill awaits a House vote. Recent Major Storm Events and Service Restoration 
In late August 2011, Tropical Storm Irene Irene presented heavy rains and damaging winds to Massachusetts and the Eastern Seaboard. Irene caused
considerable damage in NSTAR Electrics service territory. Approximately 500,000 customer outages occurred on the NSTAR Electric system in its aftermath. This represents the most severe damage event on the NSTAR Electric system in nearly 20
years. On September15, 2011, the DPU, on its own initiative, initiated an investigation into the efforts of NSTAR Electric and one other Massachusetts electric company to restore power to their customers in the aftermath of Irene. NSTAR
Electric filed a Final Event Report with the DPU regarding Irene on October3, 2011. In late October 2011, an unprecedented early snow
storm brought heavy, wet snow and strong winds to the region, impacting the electric service of approximately 200,000 NSTAR Electric customers. On November8, 2011, the DPU opened an additional investigation to review NSTAR Electric and two
other Massachusetts electric companies and their responses to the October snowstorm. NSTAR Electric filed a Final Event Report with the DPU regarding the October snowstorm on December16, 2011. 
On December20, 2011, NSTAR Electric filed a Report of Emergency Response Plan Improvements with the DPU outlining steps that had been implemented
prior to and also following the October snowstorm to improve restoration performance. The DPU has announced it will conduct a further hearing regarding NSTAR Electrics storm response on May7, 2012. 
NSTAR Electrics DPU-approved storm accounting mechanism helps to reduce the volatility of the earnings impact of severe storm restoration events.
The Company is permitted to recognize or amortize the incremental costs of severe storm restoration over several periods. The incremental cost incurred for Irene was approximately $24 million and the October snowstorm was approximately $14 million.
Transmission Capital Improvement Project Lower SEMA The Lower Southeastern Massachusetts SEMA Project consists of an expansion and upgrade of existing transmission infrastructure, and construction of a new 31 mile, 345kV transmission line that will cross
the Cape Cod Canal. On December16, 2011, ISO-NE issued formal approval for the Lower SEMA 345 kV Transmission 
35 Table of Contents
Project to be included in the Pool Transmission Facility regional rates. At a hearing held on January12, 2012, the Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board EFSB voted unanimously to
direct the EFSB Staff to prepare tentative decisions for public comment based on the EFSBs approval of the project subject to the conditions of NSTAR Electric providing reports to the EFSB every six months on project costs and schedule of
construction. Further conditions may be imposed. The Cape Cod Commission CCC unanimously approved the project on January19, 2012. The cost estimate of this project is approximately $110 million; NSTAR Electric anticipates that the project
will be in-service in 2012 or early 2013 dependent on the timing of final regulatory approvals. General Legal Matters 
In the normal course of its business, NSTAR and its subsidiaries are involved in certain legal matters, including civil litigation, for which it has
appropriately recognized legal liabilities. Management has reviewed the range of reasonably possible court-ordered damages, settlement amounts, and related litigation costs legal liabilities that could be in excess of amounts accrued and amounts
covered by insurance, and determined that the range of reasonably possible legal liabilities would not be material. Based on the information currently available, NSTAR does not believe that it is probable that any such legal liabilities will have a
material impact on its consolidated financial position. However, it is reasonably possible that additional legal liabilities that may result from changes in circumstances could have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows or
financial condition. Income Tax Matters Tax Legislation Tax legislation enacted in December 2010 increased the benefit of bonus
depreciation to 100% for tax purposes to qualified property placed in service after September8, 2010 and before January1, 2012. This legislation also provided a benefit of 50% bonus depreciation in 2012. NSTAR realized approximately $65
million of tax savings in 2010 and approximately $124 million in 2011 from bonus depreciation. NSTAR expects to realize approximately $75 million in benefits during 2012. The positive cash flow benefit generated is an acceleration of tax benefits
that NSTAR would have otherwise received over 20 years. Settlement with IRS Office of Appeals of RCN Corporation RCN Share
Abandonment Issue On September30, 2010, NSTAR accepted a settlement offer from the IRS Office of Appeals IRS Appeals on issues
related to its 2001-2007 Federal income tax returns. This development resolved all outstanding tax matters related to this period, including the RCN share abandonment issue. As previously disclosed, on December24, 2003, NSTAR formally abandoned 116million shares of RCN common stock. NSTAR deducted the share abandonment on its 2003 Federal income tax return as an
ordinary loss. The settlement with IRS Appeals includes a resolution on the characterization of the loss related to the RCN share abandonment. In 2010, NSTAR recognized a one-time after-tax charge of $205 million, including interest, related to the
settlement on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income as follows:  in millions

Receipt of Federal Tax Refund for 2001-2007 Tax Years 
On April21, 2011, NSTAR received a $1433 million refund from the IRS relating to the 2001-2007 tax years. The approved settlement and receipt of
the refund resolves all outstanding tax matters for these years.

Open Tax Years The 2011 Federal income tax return is being reviewed under the IRS Compliance Assurance Process CAP. CAP accelerates the examination of the return in order to resolve issues before the tax return is
filed. The outcome and the timing of any potential audit adjustments are uncertain. All years prior to 2011 have been examined by the IRS. 
Common Share Dividends The Board of
Trustees of NSTAR declared regular quarterly dividends of $0425 per share as follows:  On November 18, 2010, payable February 1, 2011 to shareholders of record on January 7, 2011.  On March 24, 2011, payable May 2, 2011 to shareholders of record on April 8, 2011.  On June 23, 2011, payable August 1, 2011 to shareholders of record on July 8, 2011.  On September 29, 2011, payable November 1, 2011 to shareholders of record on October 21, 2011. 
On December 1, 2011, NSTARs Board of Trustees, in anticipation of NSTAR completing its pending merger with NU, and with the intent of synchronizing
dividend payment schedules, declared a pro-rata dividend. For the period from October 22, 2011, the day after the last dividend record date, a dividend of $0004722 per common share per day was declared for the period through and including December
20, 2011. The record date for the pro-rata dividend was announced by the Board of Trustees to be the earlier of the day before the closing date of the merger or December 20, 2011. Since the merger did not close prior to December 20, 2011, the
pro-rata dividend for the 60-day period amounted to $028332 per share with a record date of December 20, 2011. The pro rata dividend was paid on January 3, 2012. Future regular quarterly common dividends, when declared, are expected to be paid on the last business day of March, June, September and December. On January 26, 2012, the Board of Trustees declared a
regular quarterly dividend of $045 per common share, payable March 30, 2012 to shareholders of record on March 1, 2012. Results of
Operations The following section of MDA compares the results of operations for each of the three fiscal years ended December31,
2011, 2010, and 2009, and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. 
2011 compared to 2010 Executive
Summary NSTAR performance results in 2011 are as follows:  Diluted EPS decreased $076 from $335 to $259  Continuing operations EPS increased from $224 to $259  Discontinued operations EPS decreased by $111  Achieved a total shareholder return for 2011 of 162%  Maintained strong financial condition and bond ratings at A+/A levels  Increased positive cash flows from operations

Net income attributable to common shareholders was $2694 million, or $259 per diluted share, for 2011 compared to
$3529 million, or $335 per diluted share for 2010. The current year includes a net charge of $64 million, or $006 per share, for costs associated with the pending merger with Northeast Utilities. The year 2010 includes a one-time gain on the
sale of MATEP of $1099 million, or $104 per share, a one-time charge of $205 million, or $020 per share, associated with an IRS settlement and merger-related costs of $6 million, or $005 per share. Excluding the merger costs in 2011 and 2010,
MATEP gain on sale in 2010 and the IRS settlement in 2010, earnings were $2759 million and $2695 million, or $265 and $256 per diluted share, in 2011 and 2010, respectively, an increase of 35%. Major factors on an after-tax basis that
contributed to the $64 million, or 24%, increase include:  Higher gas distribution revenues due to a 24% increase in sales $12 million  Higher lost base revenues and performance incentives related to the impacts of Energy Efficiency programs $73 million  Higher transmission revenues $109 million  Higher earnings contribution from NSTAR Communications $36 million  The absence in 2011 of the cumulative impact of a true-up adjustment resulting from a DPU order in May 2010 related to NSTAR Electrics transition
revenues for the years 2006-2009 $3 million  Lower net interest charges $3 million These increases in earnings factors were partially offset by:  Lower electric revenues 07% decrease in sales due to cooler summer weather and the impact of energy conservation programs $54 million
Higher depreciation and property taxes $87 million  Higher operations and maintenance expense $5 million  Absence of MATEP results of operations $7 million Significant cash flow events during 2011 include the following:  Cash flows from continuing operating activities provided approximately $7801 million, an increase of $1587 million as compared to 2010. The increase
primarily reflects receipt of a tax refund and the 
38 Table of Contents 
associated interest totaling $1433 million. Other favorable impacts include the timing of energy supply payments and customer collections related to these energy costs and lower income tax
payments as a result of bonus tax depreciation benefits in 2011.  NSTAR invested approximately $4471 million in capital projects to improve system reliability and capacity.  NSTAR paid approximately $1761 million in common share dividends, retired $993 million in long-term and securitized debt and reduced short-term
borrowings by $76 million.

NSTARs electric energy sales in 2011 decreased 07% compared to 2010. The decrease was weather related, primarily
due to a cooler second and third quarter of 2011 and a warmer than normal fourth quarter. These unfavorable weather conditions were partially offset by the first quarter weather of 2011 which had colder weather than the same period of 2010. Heating
degree-days in NSTARs service area for 2011 were up 1% from 2010. The 24% increase in firm gas and transportation sales is primarily
due to the colder first quarter winter and cooler spring conditions during 2011 as compared to the prior year, with some favorable impact from customer conversions from oil to gas. Weather and, to a lesser extent, fluctuations in fuel costs, conservation measures, and economic conditions affect sales to NSTARs residential and small commercial customers. Economic conditions,
fluctuations in fuel costs, and conservation measures affect NSTARs large commercial and industrial customers. In terms of customer sector characteristics, industrial sales are less sensitive to weather than residential and commercial sales,
which are influenced by temperature variations. Refer to the Electric Revenues and Gas Revenues sections below for more detailed discussions. NSTAR Electrics retail peak load for 2011 reached an all-time high demand of 4,978 MW on July22 that was 04% more than the previous level of 4,959 MW established in August2006 and 4%
more than the 2010 peak demand of 4,786 MW.

Weather Conditions NSTAR forecasts its electric and natural gas sales based on normal weather conditions. Actual results may vary from those projected due to actual weather conditions, energy conservation, and other
factors. Refer to the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section preceding Item1, Business of this Form 10-K. The demand for electricity and natural gas is affected by weather. Weather impacts electric sales primarily during the summer and, to a greater extent, natural gas sales during the winter season in
NSTARs service area. Customer heating or cooling usage may not directly correlate with historical levels or with the level of degree-days that occur as further discussed below, particularly when weather patterns experienced are consistently
colder or warmer. Also, NSTARs electric and natural gas businesses are sensitive to variations in daily weather, are highly influenced by New Englands seasonal weather variations, and are susceptible to damage from major storms and other
natural events and disasters that could adversely affect the Companys ability to provide energy. As shown in the table below, weather
conditions during 2011 measured by heating degree-days and cooling degree-days, respectively, were 1% higher/colder relating to heating degree-days and 69% lower/cooler related to cooling degree-days as compared to 2010, favorably impacting gas
revenues, but unfavorably impacting revenues from electric sales. The first two quarterly periods of 2011 measured by heating degree-days were higher/colder as compared to 2010, favorably impacting gas revenues. The third quarter of 2011 cooling
degree-days were 26% lower as compared to 2010, unfavorably impacting revenues from electric sales. The third quarter is typically a very low volume sales quarter for gas. The fourth quarter of 2011 heating degree-days were 209% lower/warmer as
compared to 2010, unfavorably impacting revenues from gas sales. Weather conditions during 2011 compared to the normal 30-year average for the same annual period, were 61% lower/warmer and 296% higher/warmer for heating and cooling degree-days,
respectively. Refer to the Electric Revenues and Gas Revenues sections below for more detailed discussions.

Electric Revenues NSTARs largest earnings sources are the revenues derived from distribution and transmission rates approved by the DPU and the FERC. Electric retail distribution revenues primarily represent charges
to customers for recovery of the Companys capital investment, including a return component, and operation and maintenance costs related to its electric distribution infrastructure. The transmission revenue component represents charges to
customers for the recovery of similar costs to move the electricity over high voltage lines from the generator to the Companys distribution substations. The increase of $60 million, or 05%, in retail distribution and transmission revenues primarily reflects:  Increased transmission revenues primarily due to the recovery of a higher transmission investment base, including higher depreciation and property
taxes $37 million  Increased PAM-related recovery revenues due to increased amortization of previously deferred costs $83 million 
These increases were offset by:  Decreased distribution revenues due to decreased sales of 07% due to the impact of weather conditions and a negative annual inflation rate adjustment
$89 million Energy, transition, and other revenues primarily represent charges to customers for the recovery of costs
incurred by the Company in order to acquire the energy supply on behalf of its customers and a transition charge for recovery of the Companys prior investments in generating plants and the costs related to long-term power contracts. The energy
revenues relate to customers being provided energy supply under Basic Service. These revenues are fully reconciled to the costs incurred and have no impact on NSTARs consolidated net income. Energy, transition, and other revenues also reflect
revenues related to the Companys ability to effectively reduce stranded costs incentive entitlements, rental revenue from electric property, and annual cost reconciliation true-up adjustments. Uncollected transition costs as a result of the
reductions in transition rates are deferred and collected through future rates with a carrying charge. The $94 million, or 07%, increase in energy, transition, and other revenues is primarily attributable to higher energy efficiency revenues due
to the expansion of these programs, partially offset by lower average Basic Service rates in effect due to lower energy costs. NSTAR has recognized $71 million in 2011 of Lost Base Revenues LBR relating to the impacts of the Energy Efficiency
Programs implemented under the GCA. LBR, which is subject to DPU approval, is being collected in rates. 
41 Table of Contents
Gas revenues Firm and transportation gas revenues primarily represent charges to customers for the Companys recovery of costs of its capital investment in gas infrastructure, including a return component, and
for the recovery of costs for the ongoing operation and maintenance of that infrastructure. The transportation revenue component represents charges to customers for the recovery of costs to move the natural gas through pipelines from gas suppliers
to take stations located within the Companys service area. Firm and transportation revenues increased $29 million, or 19%, primarily due to an increase in gas sales volumes of 24%, with some impact from customer conversions from oil to gas.
Energy supply and other gas revenues primarily represent charges to customers for the recovery of costs to the Company in order to acquire
the natural gas in the marketplace and a charge for recovery of the Companys gas supplier service costs. The energy supply and other revenues decrease of $48 million, or 17%, primarily reflects a decrease in the cost of gas supply. These
revenues are fully reconciled with the costs recognized by the Company and, as a result, do not have an effect on NSTARs consolidated net income Operating expenses Purchased power and transmission expense was $1,0752 million in
2011 compared to $1,1410 million in 2010, a decrease of $658 million, or 58%. The decrease in expense reflects lower Basic Service and other energy costs of $573 million resulting from lower energy commodity prices and lower transmission costs
of $85million due to a decrease in regional network support costs. NSTAR Electric adjusts its rates to collect the costs related to energy supply from customers on a fully reconciling basis. Due to this rate adjustment mechanism, changes in
the amount of energy supply expense have no impact on consolidated net income. Cost of gas sold, representing NSTAR Gas supply
expense, was $2218 million in 2011 compared to $2339 million in 2010, a decrease of $121 million, or 52%. The decrease in expense primarily reflects lower natural gas supply costs partially offset by higher sales of 24% and higher settlements
of gas hedge contracts. NSTAR Gas maintains a flexible resource portfolio consisting of an all-requirements gas supply contract, transportation contracts on interstate pipelines, market area storage, and peaking services. NSTAR Gas adjusts its rates
to collect costs related to gas supply from customers on a fully reconciling basis and therefore changes in the amount of energy supply expense have no impact on consolidated net income. Operations and maintenance expense was $4636 million in 2011 compared to $4473 million in 2010, an increase of $163 million, or 36%. One significant component of this increase in expense is
higher pension and PBOP related PAM amortization costs $87 million. Fluctuations in PAM amortization do not have an earnings impact as these costs are fully recovered from customers. Also contributing to the higher expense were transmission costs
$48 million, storm-related expenses $4 million, higher maintenance costs $28 million, and higher labor and labor-related costs $12 million. Partially offsetting the increase was lower bad debt expense $46 million. 
Depreciation and amortization expense was $3031 million in 2011 compared to $3119 million in 2010, a decrease of $88 million, or 28%. The
decrease primarily reflects the lower amortization costs related to the reduction of securitized transition costs, offset by higher depreciable distribution and transmission investments. Energy efficiency programs expense was $1935 million in 2011 compared to $1297 million in 2010, an increase of $638 million, or 492%. These costs are in accordance with the three-year plan
program guidelines established by the DPU and are collected from customers on a fully reconciling basis. Property and other taxes
expense was $1259 million in 2011 compared to $1178 million in 2010, an increase of $81 million, or 69%, reflecting higher overall property investments and higher municipal property tax rates. 
42 Table of Contents
Interest charges income: Long-term debt and transition property securitization certificate interest charges were $1267 million in 2011 compared to $136 million in 2010, a decrease of $93 million, or 68%. The decrease in
interest charges reflects scheduled principal pay downs of transition property securitization debt and the retirements of NSTARs $500 million, 8% Notes in mid-February 2010 and NSTAR Electrics $125 million, 780% Debentures in May 2010.
These reductions in interest expense were partially offset by interest expense for NSTAR Electrics $300 million, 550% Debentures issued in March 2010. Interest income and other, net were $276 million of net interest income in 2011 compared to $304 million of net interest income in 2010, a decrease of $28 million, or 92%, due to decreased
interest income on tax issues of $99 million, partially offset by higher interest income of $24 million from regulatory deferrals and $32 million in interest income from legal matters. Other income deductions: Interest tax settlement reflects the interest
expense accrual of $46 million resulting from the 2010 settlement with the IRS Office of Appeals regarding the characterization of the loss related to the RCN share abandonment. Other income was $3 million in 2011 compared to $5 million in 2010, a decrease of $2 million, or 40%. The decrease relates primarily to lower investment earnings and lower cash surrender value of
insurance policies. Other deductions were $113 million in 2011 compared to $123 million in 2010, a decrease of $1 million, or 81%.
The decrease is related to lower funding contributions made to the NSTAR Foundation of $26 million and lower other miscellaneous deductions partially offset by higher merger-related costs of $3 million. 
Income tax expense: Tax settlement
reflects the 2010 income tax expense accrual of $159 million resulting from the settlement with the IRS Office of Appeals regarding the characterization of the loss related to the RCN share abandonment. 
Income tax expense was $1684 million in 2011 compared to $1638 million in 2010, an increase of $46 million, or 28%, primarily reflecting a
higher pre-tax operating income in 2011. 2010 compared to 2009 Executive Summary NSTAR performance results in 2010 are as follows:  EPS increased $098 from $237 to $335, a 41% increase  The Companys common share dividend was increased in 2010 by 63%  Cash flows from operations increased from $6112 million to $6214 million, or 17%  NSTAR realized a $1099 million gain, net of tax from the sale of MATEP, its district energy operation facility  The total shareholder return for 2010 was 197%  NSTAR, NSTAR Electric, and NSTAR Gas each maintained their A+ SP corporate credit ratings  NSTAR completed $425 million in long-term debt financing transactions at favorable interest rates  NSTAR executed a $1227 million common share repurchase

The increase primarily
reflects lower pension contributions, partially offset by the timing of the collection of energy costs from customers and higher income tax payments.  Cash flows from investing activities included $3602 million in capital spending on projects to improve system reliability and capacity. Cash flows
from discontinued operations included $343 million in gross cash proceeds from the sale of MATEP.

NSTARs electric energy sales in 2010 increased 33% compared to 2009 primarily due to favorable weather conditions
resulting from warmer overall weather in 2010 as compared to 2009. As a result, cooling degree-days in NSTARs service area for 2010 increased 831% from the same period in 2009. Also, the sales increase reflects improving economic conditions
during 2010. The 28% decrease in firm gas and transportation sales is due to the warmer first quarter and early spring weather, partially
offset by colder weather in December. Primarily weather, but also to a lesser extent fluctuations in fuels costs, conservation measures, and
economic conditions affect sales to NSTARs residential and small commercial customers. Economic conditions, fluctuations in fuel costs, and conservation measures affect NSTARs large commercial and industrial customers. In terms of
customer sector characteristics, industrial sales are less sensitive to weather than residential and commercial sales, which are influenced by temperature variations. Refer to the Electric Revenues and Gas
Revenues sections below for more detailed discussions. NSTAR Electrics retail peak demand for 2010 was 4,786 MW measured on
July6, 2010 which was 35% less than the all-time high peak demand of 4,959 MW reached on August2, 2006. Weather Conditions
NSTAR forecasts its electric and natural gas sales based on normal weather conditions. Actual results may vary from those projected due to

The demand for electricity and natural gas is affected by weather. Weather impacts electric sales primarily
during the summer and, to a greater extent, gas sales during the winter season in NSTARs service area. Customer heating or cooling usage may not directly correlate with historical levels or with the level of degree-days that occur as further
discussed below, particularly when weather patterns experienced are consistently colder or warmer. Also, NSTARs electric and gas businesses are sensitive to variations in daily weather, are highly influenced by New Englands seasonal
weather variations, and are susceptible to natural events and disasters, such as severe storms that could adversely affect the Companys ability to provide energy. As shown on the table below, weather conditions during the first three quarters of 2010 measured by heating degree-days were lower/warmer for 2010 as compared to 2009, favorably impacting electric
revenues. The fourth quarter of 2010 had colder weather conditions compared to 2009, favorably impacting gas sales. Weather conditions during the three summer months ended September30, 2010 measured by cooling degree-days were 582%
higher/warmer as compared to the same period in 2009, favorably impacting electric revenues. Refer to the Electric Revenues and Gas Revenues sections below for more detailed discussions.

Electric Revenues NSTARs largest earnings sources are the revenues derived from distribution and transmission rates approved by the DPU and the FERC. Electric retail distribution revenues primarily represent charges
to customers for recovery of the Companys capital investment, including a return component, and operation and maintenance 
46 Table of Contents
costs related to its electric distribution infrastructure. The transmission revenue component represents charges to customers for the recovery of similar costs to move the electricity over high
voltage lines from the generator to the Companys distribution substations. The increase of $1313 million, or 124%, in retail
distribution and transmission revenues primarily reflects:  Increased transmission revenues primarily due to the recovery of a higher transmission investment base, including higher depreciation and property
taxes and recovery of higher regional network service and other costs $735 million  Increased sales of 33% due to the impact of weather conditions, in addition to the annual inflation rate adjustment $376 million
Energy, transition, and other revenues primarily represent charges to customers for the recovery of costs incurred by the
Company in order to acquire the energy supply on behalf of its customers and a transition charge for recovery of the Companys prior investments in generating plants and the costs related to long-term power contracts. The energy revenues relate
to customers being provided energy supply under Basic Service. These revenues are fully reconciled to the costs incurred and have no impact on NSTARs consolidated net income. Energy, transition, and other revenues also reflect revenues related
to the Companys ability to effectively reduce stranded costs incentive entitlements, rental revenue from electric property, and annual cost reconciliation true-up adjustments. The $2119 million, or 14%, decrease in energy, transition, and
other revenues is primarily attributable to lower Basic Service rates in effect due to lower energy costs. Uncollected transition costs as a result of the reductions in transition rates are deferred and collected through future rates with a carrying
charge. Gas revenues Firm and transportation gas revenues primarily represent charges to customers for the Companys recovery of costs of its capital investment in gas infrastructure, including a return component, and
for the recovery of costs for the ongoing operation and maintenance of that infrastructure. The transportation revenue component represents charges to customers for the recovery of costs to move the natural gas over pipelines from gas suppliers to
take stations located within the Companys service area. Firm and transportation revenues increased $36 million, or 25%, primarily due to higher average CGAC rates that offset a decrease in gas sales volumes of 28%. 
Energy supply and other gas revenues primarily represent charges to customers for the recovery of costs to the Company in order to acquire the natural
gas in the marketplace and a charge for recovery of the companys gas supplier service costs. The energy supply and other revenues decrease of $605 million, or 179%, primarily reflects a decrease in the cost of gas supply. These revenues are
fully reconciled with the costs currently recognized by the Company and, as a result, do not have an effect on NSTARs consolidated net income. Operating expenses Purchased power and transmission expense was $1,1410 million in
2010 compared to $1,2605 million in 2009, a decrease of $1195 million, or 95%. The decrease in expense reflects lower Basic Service and other energy costs of $1743 million. These decreases were partially offset by higher transmission costs of
$548 million due to an increase in regional network support costs and increased sales. NSTAR Electric adjusts its rates to collect the costs related to energy supply from customers on a fully reconciling basis. Due to this rate adjustment
mechanism, changes in the amount of energy supply expense have no impact on consolidated net income. Cost of gas sold, representing
NSTAR Gas supply expense, was $2339 million in 2010 compared to $2979 million in 2009, a decrease of $64 million, or 215%. The decrease in expense primarily reflects the lower energy costs and lower sales of 28%. NSTAR Gas maintains a
flexible resource portfolio consisting of an all-requirements gas supply contract, transportation contracts on interstate pipelines, market area storage, and 
47 Table of Contents
peaking services. NSTAR Gas adjusts its rates to collect costs related to gas supply from customers on a fully reconciling basis and therefore changes in the amount of energy supply expense have
no impact on consolidated net income. Operations and maintenance expense was $4473 million in 2010 compared to $4112 million in
2009, an increase of $361 million, or 88%. The primary increase in expense reflects higher pension and PBOP related PAM amortization costs $20 million. Fluctuations in PAM amortization do not have an earnings impact as these costs are fully
recovered from customers. Also contributing to the higher expenses were labor and employee related costs $55 million, higher storm-related expenses $46 million, higher transmission maintenance costs $42 million, and higher bad debt expense
$17 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $3119 million in 2010 compared to $3701 million in 2009, a decrease of
$582 million, or 157%. The decrease primarily reflects the completion of the 10-year amortization related to merger integration costs and lower amortization costs related to the pay-down of securitized transition costs, offset by higher
depreciable distribution and transmission plant-in-service. Energy efficiency programs expense was $1297 million in 2010 compared to
$89 million in 2009, an increase of $407 million, or 457%. These costs are in accordance with program guidelines established by the DPU and are collected from customers on a fully reconciling basis plus a performance incentive. NSTAR anticipated a
further increase in Energy Efficiency spending during 2010 and in future years driven by requirements of the GCA. Those spending increases are funded partially through proceeds from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and through NSTARs
participation in the Forward Capacity Market. Property and other taxes expense was $1178 million in 2010 compared to $1071 million
in 2009, an increase of $107 million, or 10%, reflecting higher overall property investments and higher tax rates. Interest charges
income: Long-term debt and transition property securitization certificate interest charges were $1360 million in 2010 compared
to $1521 million in 2009, a decrease of $161 million, or 106%. The decrease in interest charges reflects scheduled principal pay downs of transition property securitization debt and the retirement of NSTARs $500 million, 8% Notes in
mid-February 2010 and NSTAR Electrics $125 million, 78% Debentures in May 2010. These reductions in interest expense were partially offset by recent debt issuances at lower average effective interest rates. 
Interest income and other, net were $304 million of net interest income in 2010 compared to $235 million of net interest income in 2009, an
increase of $69 million, or 294%, due to increased interest income of $53 million related to higher regulatory deferrals, and higher interest income on income tax matters of $08 million. Other income deductions: Interest tax settlement reflects the 2010
interest expense accrual of $46 million due to the IRS as a result of the settlement with the IRS Office of Appeals regarding the characterization of the loss related to the RCN share abandonment. 
Other income was $5 million in 2010 compared to $66 million in 2009, a decrease of $16 million, or 242%. The decrease relates primarily to
lower investment income. Other deductions were $123 million in 2010 compared to $37 million in 2009, an increase of $86 million, or
2324%. The increase relates primarily to merger-related expenses of $64 million related to the pending merger of NSTAR and NU, higher funding contributions made to the NSTAR Foundation of $09 million and higher other miscellaneous deductions of
$13 million. 
48 Table of Contents
Income tax expense: Tax settlement reflects the 2010 income tax accrual of $159 million resulting from the settlement with the IRS Office of Appeals regarding the characterization of the loss related to the RCN share
abandonment. Income tax expense was $1638 million in 2010 compared to $1469 million in 2009, an increase of $169 million, or 115 primarily reflecting a higher pre-tax operating income in 2010. Liquidity, Commitments and Capital Resources 
Access to Capital Markets NSTAR
has been able to consistently and successfully access capital markets to issue long-term debt and also to facilitate short-term financing for working capital needs. NSTAR and its subsidiaries utilize the commercial paper market to meet their
short-term cash requirements. NSTAR and NSTAR Electric currently have Revolving Credit Agreements in place through December 2012. These Credit Agreements serve as a liquidity backup to the commercial paper program. Short-term commercial paper debt
obligations are commonly refinanced to long-term obligations with fixed-rate bonds or notes as needed or when interest rates are considered favorable. Refer to the accompanying Item1A, Risk Factors, for a further discussion.
NSTAR continuously evaluates the funding level of its Pension and PBOP plans and the extent to which additional cash contributions may be
necessary. Should NSTAR elect to increase its future level of funding to these plans, NSTAR believes it has adequate access to capital resources to support its contributions. Working Capital During 2011 and 2010, NSTAR successfully refinanced several current maturities of
long-term debt obligations. NSTARs Holding company $500 million Note that matured in February 2010 was financed with debt issued in the prior year. On January14, 2010, NSTAR Gas entered into a $125 million Bond Purchase Agreement with
private investors on a 10-year First Mortgage Bond series at a coupon rate of 446%. Funding took place on January28, 2010. On March16, 2010, NSTAR Electric issued, at a discount, $300 million of 550% Debentures due 2040. The proceeds
from this sale were used to retire NSTAR Electrics short-term debt and for other corporate purposes. On May17, 2010, NSTAR Electric retired its $125 million, 78% Debentures as scheduled. On August1, 2011, NSTAR Electric redeemed
$15 million of Massachusetts Industrial Finance Agency Bonds, 575% due February 2014, at par. NSTAR believes that it has adequate access to
short-term credit markets to facilitate its working capital needs at favorable terms. As of December31, 2011, NSTAR, NSTAR Electric, and NSTAR Gas had $175 million, $450 million, and $75 million, respectively, in available unused revolving
credit facilities in order to meet working capital needs. Capital Expenditures and Contractual Obligations 
The most recent estimates of capital expenditures for 2012 and the years 2013-2016 are as follows:  in millions

520 1,540 
The amounts shown above exclude expenditures for NSTARs proposed transmission investment with Northeast Utilities
and Hydro-Quebec as these costs will be incurred by NPT. 
49 Table of Contents
Management continuously reviews its capital expenditure and financing programs. These programs and the
estimates included in this Form 10-K are subject to revision due to changes in regulatory requirements, operating requirements, environmental standards, availability and cost of capital, interest rates and other assumptions. 
In addition to plant expenditures, NSTAR enters into a variety of contractual obligations and other commitments in the course of ordinary business
activities. The following table summarizes NSTARs significant contractual cash obligations as of December31, 2011:  in millions

Transition property securitization payments reflect securities issued in 2005 for BEC Funding II, LLC and CEC Funding,
LLC. These funding entities recover the principal and interest obligations for their transition property securitization bonds from customers of NSTAR Electric, through a component of NSTAR Electrics transition charges and, as a result, these
payment obligations do not affect NSTARs overall cash flow. Transmission obligations represent the obligation to support the carrying
costs of facilities utilized. Purchase obligations relate to transmission and distribution equipment, computer software and equipment, and
various supplies. Management cannot estimate projected Pension and PBOP contributions beyond 2016. Refer to Note I, Pension and
Other Postretirement Benefits, in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Electric capacity and gas
transportation and storage obligations reflect obligations for purchased power and the cost of gas, respectively, and are fully recoverable. As a result, these payment obligations do not affect NSTARs results of operations. 
Gas purchase obligations is the estimated amount to be paid to NSTAR Gas portfolio manager to meet customer demand and replenish inventory.
Obligations related to the decommissioning of nuclear generating units are based on estimates from the Yankee Companies management and
reflect the total remaining approximate cost for decommissioning and/or security or protection of the three units in which NSTAR Electric has equity investments. Decommissioning costs are fully recoverable from customers. 
50 Table of Contents
The electric interconnection agreement relates to a single interconnection with a municipal utility for
additional capacity into NSTAR Electrics service territory. Renewable electric energy contract obligations represent projected payments
under long-term agreements. Electric energy contracts Basic Service represent obligations under Basic Service load provider agreements.
The purchase power buy-out obligation relates to NSTAR Electrics execution of several agreements to buy-out or restructure certain
long-term purchase power contracts. NSTAR Electric fully recovers these payments through its transition charge. These amounts represent payments by NSTAR Electric for these agreements. 
Current Cash Flow Activity 
NSTARs primary uses of cash in 2011 included capital expenditures, dividend payments, short-term debt payments, long-term and securitized debt
redemptions, and pension and postretirement plan contributions. NSTARs primary sources of cash in 2011 included cash from electric and gas operations and an IRS tax refund. 
Operating Activities 
The net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $7801 million in 2011, as compared to $6214 million in 2010, an increase of $1587 million
primarily due to receipt of a tax refund and associated interest of $1433 million, the timing of energy supply payments and related recovery of these costs from customers, and lower estimated income tax payments due to bonus depreciation benefits.
Investing Activities The net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations in 2011 was $4287 million was compared to cash used of $3812 million in 2010. The majority of the plant expenditures were for system
reliability improvements and capacity improvements in the NSTAR service territory. Cash flows from investing activities of discontinued operations consist primarily of the proceeds from the MATEP sale. 
Financing Activities 
Net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations in 2011 was $3528 million compared to $5523 million in 2010, a decrease of $1995
million. Uses of cash primarily reflect long-term and securitized debt redemptions of $993 million in 2011 compared to $7216 million in 2010. In addition, NSTARs short-term debt decreased by $76 million. There were no debt financings in
2011. Sources of cash during 2010 included proceeds from NSTAR Electrics issuance of $300 million in long-term debt and NSTAR Gas issuance of $125 million in long-term debt. Also contributing to the decrease was the absence of a $1235
million accelerated share repurchase executed in 2010. Income Tax Payments 
During 2011, NSTAR received a net tax refund of $1173 million and made estimated tax payments of $794 million. In 2010, NSTAR made income tax payments
of $1587 million. The tax refund in 2011 relates to the settlement with the IRS Office of Appeals on issues related to its 2001-2007 Federal income tax returns. Long-Term Financing Activities On August1, 2011, NSTAR Electric redeemed $15 million
of Massachusetts Industrial Finance Agency Bonds, 575%, due February 2014, at par. 
51 Table of Contents
On January28, 2010, NSTAR Gas issued $125 million of its 446% fixed rate 10-year First Mortgage
Bonds, Series N. The proceeds from this sale were used to reduce short-term debt. In mid-February 2010, NSTAR retired, at maturity, its $500
million, 8% Notes. The short-term borrowing capacity and short-term investments that resulted from the November 2009 $350 million 450% Debentures issued by NSTAR were utilized to help pay these Notes. 
On March15, 2010, NSTAR Electrics subsidiary, BEC Funding LLC, retired its final series of outstanding Transition Property Securitization
Certificates. On March16, 2010, NSTAR Electric issued, at a discount, $300 million of 550% Debentures due 2040. The proceeds from this sale were used to retire NSTAR Electrics short-term debt and for other corporate purposes. On
May17, 2010, NSTAR Electric retired its $125 million, 78% Debentures as scheduled. On June1, 2010, in connection with the sale of MATEP, NSTAR retired MATEPs 6924% Senior Notes due June30, 2021 with a principal balance of
$855 million, with a portion of the proceeds from the sale. In addition to the principal balance, the redemption included a debt retirement premium of $18 million. NSTAR Electric anticipates filing a new two-year financing plan with the DPU during 2012 to seek approval to issue long-term debt securities. 
Short-Term Financing Activities NSTARs short-term debt decreased by $76 million to $3115 million at December31, 2011 compared to $3875 million at December31, 2010. The decrease resulted primarily from the receipt of
a tax refund and associated interest of $1433 million, the timing of energy payments and related recovery of these costs from customers, and lower estimated tax payments due to bonus deprecation benefits. 
The banking arrangements in place require NSTAR and its subsidiaries to make daily cash transfers to fund vendor checks that are presented for payment.
These banking arrangements do not permit the right of offset among the Companys subsidiaries cash accounts. In the event of a credit book balance in any one of the Companys cash accounts resulting from uncleared checks, the Company
will adjust its disbursement cash account accordingly. Changes in the balances of the disbursement cash accounts are reflected in financing activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
Sources of Additional Capital and Financial Covenant Requirements With the exception of bond indemnity agreements and gas hedging agreements, NSTAR has no financial guarantees, commitments, debt or lease agreements that would require a change in terms and conditions,
such as acceleration of payment obligations, as a result of a change in its credit rating. However, in addition to the bond indemnity and gas hedging agreements, NSTARs subsidiaries could be required to provide additional security for energy
supply contract performance obligations, such as a letter of credit for their pro-rata share of the remaining value of such contracts. NSTAR
and NSTAR Electric have no financial covenant requirements under their respective long-term debt arrangements. Pursuant to a revolving credit agreement, NSTAR Electric must maintain a total debt to capitalization ratio no greater than 65% at all
times. The prescribed ratio is calculated excluding Transition Property Securitization Certificates from debt and accumulated other comprehensive income loss from common equity. The ratio includes in debt unfunded vested benefits under
postretirement benefit plans, contract liability positions including swaps and hedges, capital lease liabilities, and corporate guarantees. NSTAR Gas must also maintain a total debt to capitalization ratio no greater than 65% at all times pursuant
to its revolving credit agreement. NSTAR Gas was in compliance with its financial covenant requirements, including a minimum equity requirement, under its long-term debt arrangements at December31, 2011 and 2010. Under the minimum equity
requirement, the outstanding long-term debt of NSTAR Gas must not exceed equity. NSTARs long-term debt other than its secured debt issued by NSTAR Gas is unsecured. 
52 Table of Contents
NSTAR currently has a $175 million revolving credit agreement that expires December31, 2012. At
December31, 2011 and 2010, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. This credit facility serves as a backup to NSTARs $175 million commercial paper program that, at December31, 2011 and 2010, had $170
million and $160 million outstanding, respectively. Under the terms of the credit agreement, NSTAR is required to maintain a maximum total consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than 65% at all times. The prescribed ratio is
calculated excluding both Transition Property Securitization Certificates from debt and accumulated other comprehensive income loss from common equity. The ratio includes in debt unfunded vested benefits under postretirement benefit plans,
contract liability positions including swaps and hedges, capital lease liabilities, and corporate guarantees. Commitment fees must be paid on the total agreement amount. At December31, 2011 and 2010, NSTAR was in full compliance with the
aforementioned covenant as the ratios were 556% and 569%, respectively. In mid-February 2010, NSTAR retired its $500 million, 8% Notes as
scheduled. On March16, 2010, NSTAR Electric sold $300 million of 550% Debentures due March15, 2040. NSTAR and NSTAR Electric used the proceeds from the issuance of these securities for the redemption or repayment of outstanding
long-term debt and short-term debt balances and/or general working capital purposes. NSTAR Electric has approval from the FERC to issue
short-term debt securities from time to time on or before October22, 2012, with maturity dates no later than October21, 2013, in amounts such that the aggregate principal does not exceed $655 million at any one time. NSTAR Electric has a
five-year, $450 million revolving credit agreement that expires December31, 2012. However, unless NSTAR Electric receives necessary approvals from the DPU, the credit agreement will expire 364 days from the date of the first draw under the
agreement. At December31, 2011 and 2010, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. This credit facility serves as backup to NSTAR Electrics $450 million commercial paper program that had $1415 million and
$2275 million balances outstanding at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. At December31, 2011 and 2010, NSTAR Electric was in full compliance with its covenants in connection with its short-term credit facilities, as the total debt
to capitalization ratios were 454% and 466%, respectively. In connection with the pending merger with Northeast Utilities, NSTAR and NSTAR
Electric received waivers and executed amendments to their respective revolving credit agreements necessary to allow completion of the merger. 
NSTAR Gas has a $75 million revolving credit facility. This facility is due to expire on June8, 2012. As of December31, 2011 and 2010, NSTAR
Gas had no amounts outstanding. At December31, 2011 and 2010, NSTAR Gas was in full compliance with its covenant in connection with its facility, as the total debt to capitalization ratios were 516% and 533%, respectively. 
Historically, NSTAR and its subsidiaries have had a variety of external sources of financing available, as previously indicated, at favorable rates and
terms to finance its external cash requirements. However, the availability of such financing at favorable rates and terms depends heavily upon prevailing market conditions and NSTARs or its subsidiaries financial condition and credit
ratings. NSTARs goal is to maintain a capital structure that preserves an appropriate balance between debt and equity. As of
December31, 2011, NSTARs subsidiaries could declare and pay dividends of up to approximately $13 billion of their total common equity approximately $25 billion to NSTAR and remain in compliance with debt covenants. Based on
NSTARs key cash resources available as previously discussed, management believes its liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to meet its current and projected cash requirements. Commitments and Contingencies NSTAR is exposed to uncertain tax positions and regulatory
matters as discussed in this MDA under the caption Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, and as disclosed in Note P, Commitments and Contingencies, in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Performance Assurances from Electricity and Gas Supply Agreements 
Electric Agreements NSTAR Electric
continuously enters into power purchase agreements to meet its entire Basic Service supply obligations. NSTAR Electrics power suppliers are either investment grade companies or are subsidiaries of larger companies with investment grade or
better credit ratings that guaranty the suppliers obligations. In accordance with NSTARs Internal Credit Policy, and to minimize NSTAR Electric risk in the event the supplier encounters financial difficulties or otherwise fails to
perform, NSTAR Electric evaluates the suppliers credit and NSTAR Electrics potential exposure on a supplier default, and when necessary obtains letters of credit or other acceptable financial security instruments. In addition, under
these agreements, if a supplier or its parent guarantor fails to maintain an investment grade credit rating, it is required to provide additional financial security for performance of its obligations. These agreements also include a reciprocal
provision, where in the event that NSTAR Electric is downgraded below investment grade, it would be required to provide additional security for performance, such as a letter of credit. In view of current volatility in the energy supply industry,
NSTAR Electric is unable to determine whether its suppliers or their parent guarantors will become subject to financial difficulties, or whether these financial assurances and guarantees are sufficient. In the event the supplier or its guarantor
does not provide the required additional financial security as required under the agreement, NSTAR Electric may then terminate the agreement and collect a liquidation payment from the defaulting supplier. In such event, NSTAR Electric may be
required to secure alternative sources of supply at higher or lower prices depending on prevailing market conditions than provided under the terminated agreements. Gas Agreements NSTAR Gas continually evaluates the financial stability of current and
prospective gas suppliers. Both parties are required to have and maintain investment grade credit ratings or financial assurances and guarantees that include both parental guarantees and letters of credit in place from the parent company of the
supplier. The firm gas supply agreements allow either party to require financial assurance, or, if necessary, contract termination in the event that either party is downgraded below investment grade level and is unable to provide financial assurance
acceptable to the other party. In addition, these agreements contain cross-default provisions that would allow NSTAR Gas and its counterparties to terminate and liquidate a gas hedge contract if either party is in default on other swap agreements
with that same counterparty, or another unrelated agreement with that same counterparty in excess of stipulated threshold amounts. Virtually
all of NSTAR Gas firm gas supply agreements are short-term one year or less and utilize market-based, monthly indexed pricing mechanisms so the financial risk to the Company would be minimal if a supplier were to fail to perform. However, in
the event that a firm supplier does fail to perform under its firm gas supply agreement, the Company would be entitled to any positive difference between the monthly supply price and the cost of replacement supplies. The cost of gas procured for
firm gas sales customers is recovered through a cost of gas adjustment mechanism which is updated semi-annually. Under DPU regulations, interim adjustments to the cost of gas are required when the actual costs of gas supply vary from projections by
more than 5%. Financial and Performance Guarantees On a limited basis, NSTAR and certain of its subsidiaries may enter into agreements providing financial assurance to third parties. At December31, 2011, outstanding guarantees totaled $292 million as follows:  in thousands Surety Bonds 25,694 Hydro-Quebec Transmission Company Guarantees 3,459 
Total Guarantees 29,153 
54 Table of Contents
Surety Bonds As of December31, 2011, certain of NSTARs subsidiaries have purchased a total of $22 million of performance surety bonds for the purpose of obtaining licenses, permits and rights-of-way in
various municipalities. In addition, NSTAR and certain of its subsidiaries have purchased approximately $235 million in workers compensation self-insurer bonds. These bonds support the guarantee by NSTAR and certain of its subsidiaries to the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, required as part of the Companys workers compensation self-insurance program. NSTAR and certain of its subsidiaries have indemnity agreements to provide additional financial security to its bond company in
the form of a contingent letter of credit to be triggered in the event of a downgrade in the future of NSTARs Senior Note rating to below BBB by SP and/or to below Baa2 by Moodys. These indemnity agreements cover both the
performance surety bonds and workers compensation bonds. Hydro-Quebec Transmission Company Guarantees
NSTAR and its subsidiaries have also issued $35 million of residual value guarantees related to its equity interest in the Hydro-Quebec
Transmission Companies, NEH and NHH. Management believes the likelihood that NSTAR would be required to perform or otherwise incur any
significant losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote. Contingencies 
Environmental Matters 
NSTAR subsidiaries face possible liabilities as a result of involvement in several multi-party disposal sites, state-regulated sites or third party claims
associated with contamination remediation. NSTAR generally expects to have only a small percentage of the total potential liability for the majority of these sites. As of December31, 2011 and 2010, NSTAR had liabilities of $13 million and
$09 million, respectively, for these environmental sites. This estimated recorded liability is based on an evaluation of all currently available facts with respect to these sites. NSTAR Gas is participating in the assessment or remediation of certain former MGP sites and alleged MGP waste disposal sites to determine if and to what extent such sites have been contaminated and
whether NSTAR Gas may be responsible to undertake remedial action. The DPU permits recovery of costs associated with MGP sites over a 7-year period, without carrying costs. As of December31, 2011 and 2010, NSTAR had a liability of
approximately $10 million and $159 million, respectively, as an estimate for site cleanup costs for several MGP sites for which NSTAR Gas was identified as a potentially responsible party. A corresponding regulatory asset was recorded that reflects
the future rate recovery for these costs. Estimates related to environmental remediation costs are reviewed and adjusted as further
investigation and assignment of responsibility occurs and as either additional sites are identified or NSTARs responsibilities for such sites evolve or are resolved. NSTARs ultimate liability for future environmental remediation costs
may vary from these estimates. Based on NSTARs current assessment of its environmental responsibilities, existing legal requirements, and regulatory policies, NSTAR does not believe that these environmental remediation costs will have a
material adverse effect on NSTARs consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

As discussed in the following section, NSTARs exposure to financial market risk results primarily from fluctuations
in interest rates.  Item7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Energy Risk Management NSTARs Energy Procurement Policy governs all energy-related
transactions for its regulated electric and gas subsidiaries. This Policy is reviewed annually and is administered by NSTARs Risk Committee. The Committee is chaired by NSTARs chief executive officer and includes other senior officers.
Items covered by this Policy and approved by the Committee are all new energy supply transactions, authorization limits, energy related derivative and hedging transactions, and counter-party credit profiles. 
Commodity and Credit Risk Although
NSTAR has material energy commodity purchase contracts, any potential market risk, including counter-party credit risk, should not have an adverse impact on NSTARs results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. NSTARs electric
and gas distribution subsidiaries have rate-making mechanisms that allow for the recovery of energy supply costs from those customers who make commodity purchases from NSTARs electric and gas subsidiaries rather than from the competitive
market supplier. All energy supply costs incurred by NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas in providing energy to their retail customers are recovered on a fully reconciling basis. In addition, NSTAR has minimal cash flow risk due to the short-term nature of these contracts and the rate-making mechanisms that permit recovery of these costs in a timely manner. The majority of
NSTARs electric and gas commodity purchase contracts range in term from three to twelve months. NSTAR Electric has the ability to seek cost recovery and adjust its rates as frequently as every three months for its large commercial and
industrial customers and every six months for its residential customers. NSTAR Gas has the ability to seek cost recovery as required if costs exceed 5% of the current projected cost recovery level. Both NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas earn a carrying
charge on under-collected commodity balances that would mitigate any incremental short-term borrowings costs. NSTAR believes it is unlikely that it would be exposed to a liquidity risk resulting from significant market price increases based on the
recovery mechanisms currently in place. To mitigate the cash flow and cost variability related to the commodity price risk on approximately
one-third of its natural gas purchases, NSTAR Gas purchases financial futures contracts on behalf of its customers. NSTAR Gas has a rate-making mechanism that provides for recovery of the actual settlement value of these contracts on a fully
reconciling basis. Refer to the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note G, Derivative Instruments - Hedging Agreements, for a further discussion. Interest Rate Risk NSTAR believes its interest risk primarily relates to short-term debt
obligations and anticipated future long-term debt financing requirements to fund its capital programs. These short-term debt obligations are typically 
56 Table of Contents
refinanced with fixed-rate long-term notes as needed and when market interest rates are favorable. At December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, all of NSTARs long-term debt had fixed
interest rates. The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily based on levels of short-term commercial paper outstanding. The weighted average interest rates, excluding fees for short-term indebtedness, were 015% and 023% for 2011
and 2010, respectively. On a long-term basis, NSTAR mitigates its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt of various maturities.

Note A.Business Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
1. About NSTAR NSTAR or the
Company is a holding company engaged through its subsidiaries in the energy delivery business serving approximately 14million customers in Massachusetts, including approximately 11million electric distribution customers in 81
communities and approximately 300,000 natural gas distribution customers in 51 communities. NSTARs retail electric and natural gas transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries are NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas, respectively. Harbor
Electric Energy Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NSTAR Electric, provides distribution service and ongoing support to its only customer, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. On June1, 2010, NSTAR completed the sale of its stock
ownership interest in its district energy operations business, Medical Area Total Energy Plant, Inc. MATEP. NSTAR also has unregulated subsidiaries in telecommunications NSTAR Com and liquefied natural gas Hopkinton. For segment reporting
purposes, NSTAR has aggregated the results of operations and assets of NSTAR Com with the electric utility operations, and Hopkinton with gas utility operations. NSTAR consolidates two wholly-owned special purpose subsidiaries, BEC Funding II, LLC and CEC Funding, LLC. These entities were created to complete the sale of electric rate reduction certificates to a
special purpose trust created by two Massachusetts state agencies. These financing transactions securitized the costs incurred related to the divestiture of generation assets and long-term power contracts. The activities of a third special purpose
subsidiary, BEC Funding LLC, were substantially completed as of March31, 2010 and the Company was dissolved on April14, 2010. 
2.Pending Merger with Northeast Utilities 
On October16, 2010, upon unanimous approval from their respective Boards of Trustees, NSTAR and Northeast Utilities NU entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger the Merger Agreement. The transaction will be a merger of equals in a stock-for-stock transfer. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at closing, NSTAR will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of NU. On March4, 2011, shareholders of each company approved the merger and adopted the Merger Agreement. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, NSTAR shareholders will receive 1312 NU common shares for each NSTAR common share
that they own. Following completion of the merger, it is anticipated that NU shareholders will own approximately 56 percent of the post-merger company and former NSTAR shareholders will own approximately 44 percent of the post-merger company.
The post-merger company will provide electric and gas energy delivery services through six regulated electric and gas utilities in
Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire serving nearly 35million electric and gas customers. Completion of the merger is subject to various customary conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. Acting pursuant to the
terms of the Merger Agreement, on October14, 2011, NU and NSTAR formally extended the date by which either party has the right to terminate the Merger Agreement should all required closing conditions not be satisfied, including receipt of all
required regulatory approvals, from October16, 2011 to April16, 2012. Regulatory Approvals on Pending Merger
with Northeast Utilities Federal On January4, 2011, NSTAR and NU received approval from the Federal Communications Commission. On February 10, 2011, the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period expired. On July6, 2011,
NSTAR and NU received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC. Consent of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC was received on December20, 2011. 
65 Table of Contents
Massachusetts On November24, 2010, NSTAR and NU filed a joint petition requesting the DPUs approval of their proposed merger. On March10, 2011, the DPU issued an order that modified the standard of
review to be applied in the review of mergers involving Massachusetts utilities from a no net harm standard to a net benefits standard, meaning that the companies must demonstrate that the pending merger provides benefits
that outweigh the costs. Applicable state law provides that mergers of Massachusetts utilities and their respective holding companies must be consistent with the public interest. The order states that the DPU has flexibility in applying
the factors applicable to the standard of review. NSTAR and NU filed supplemental testimony with the DPU on April8, 2011 indicating the merger could provide post-merger net savings of approximately $784 million in the first ten years following
the closing of the merger and provide environmental benefits with respect to Massachusetts emissions reductions, global warming policies, and furthering the goals of Massachusetts Green Communities Act. 
The DPU held public evidentiary hearings during July 2011. Upon conclusion of the public evidentiary hearings on July28, 2011, the DPU issued a
briefing schedule that arranged for a series of intervenor and NSTAR and NU briefs and reply briefs culminating in the delivery of the final NSTAR and NU reply briefs on September19, 2011. Subsequently, NSTAR and NU agreed to different
intervenor motions to extend the briefing schedule, and the DPU consented to these motions. The final NSTAR and NU reply briefs were filed on October31, 2011. On July15, 2011, the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources DOER filed a motion for an indefinite stay in the proceedings. On July21, 2011, NSTAR and NU filed a response objecting to
this motion. The DPU originally scheduled Oral Arguments for November17, 2011 regarding the DOERs Motion to Stay the proceeding, which were postponed during the fourth quarter of 2011 while NSTAR, NU and other parties made attempts to
narrow and discuss the issues presented by the DOERs Motion to Stay. On January6, 2012, the Oral Arguments were conducted regarding the DOERs Motion to Stay. At the Oral Argument, DOER withdrew its request for a fully adjudicated
rate case, which would have required an extended stay of the proceeding. NSTAR and NU await approval of the merger from the DPU. Connecticut On June1, 2011, the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority
PURA, formerly the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control DPUC, issued a declaratory ruling stating that it lacked jurisdiction to review the NSTAR merger with NU. On June30, 2011, the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel filed
a Petition for Administrative Appeal in Connecticut Superior Court requesting that the Superior Court remand the decision back to the PURA with instructions to reopen the docket and review the merger transaction. 
On January4, 2012, the PURA issued a draft decision in Docket No10-12-05RE01 that revised its earlier declaratory ruling of June1,
2011, which had concluded it did not have jurisdiction to review the pending merger between NU and NSTAR. Following oral arguments on January12, 2012, the PURA issued its final decision on January18, 2012 that concluded that NU and NSTAR
must seek approval to merge from the PURA pursuant to Connecticut state law. On January19, 2012, NU and NSTAR filed their merger review application with the PURA. On January20, 2012, the PURA issued a procedural schedule that includes a
draft decision on March26, 2012 and a final decision on April2, 2012. New Hampshire 
On April5, 2011, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission NHPUC issued an order finding that it does not have statutory authority to approve
or reject the merger. Maine On May11, 2011, the Maine Public Utilities Commission issued an order approving the merger contingent upon approval by the FERC. The FERC approval was received on July6, 2011.

3.Basis of Consolidation and Accounting The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the results of operations, comprehensive income, common shareholders equity, financial position and cash flows of NSTAR and its
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to the accompanying prior years consolidated financial statements to conform to the current years
presentation. NSTARs utility subsidiaries follow accounting policies prescribed by the FERC and the DPU. In addition, NSTAR and its
subsidiaries are subject to the accounting and reporting requirements of the SEC. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. NSTARs utility subsidiaries are subject to the application of Accounting
Standards Codification ASC 980, Regulated Operations, that considers the effects of regulation resulting from differences in the timing of their recognition of certain revenues and expenses from those of other businesses and industries. The
energy delivery business is subject to rate-regulation that is based on cost recovery and meets the criteria for application of ASC 980. Refer to Note F, Regulatory Assets, for more information. 
4.Use of Estimates The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management of NSTAR and its subsidiaries to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 5.Revenues Electric and gas revenues are based on authorized rates approved by the DPU and
the FERC. Estimates of distribution and transition revenues for electricity and natural gas delivered to customers but not yet billed are accrued at the end of each accounting period. Revenues for NSTARs unregulated subsidiaries are recognized when services are rendered. NSTAR records sales taxes collected from its customers on a net basis excluded from operating revenues.
6.Utility Plant Utility
plant is stated at original cost. The cost of replacements of property units is capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The original cost of property retired, net of salvage value, is charged to accumulated depreciation. The
incurred related cost of removal is charged against the Deferred credits and other liabilities: Regulatory liability - cost of removal in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following is a summary of utility property and
equipment, at cost, at December31:  in thousands

8.Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation of utility plant is computed on a straight-line basis using composite rates based on the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property. The composite rates are subject to the
approval of the DPU and the FERC. The rates include a cost of removal component, which is collected from customers during the service life of the property. The overall rates and depreciation and amortization expense of utility plant were as follows:

9.Allowance for Borrowed Funds Used During Construction AFUDC 
AFUDC represents the estimated costs to finance utility plant construction. In accordance with regulatory accounting, AFUDC is included as a cost of
utility plant and a reduction of current interest charges. Although AFUDC is not a current source of cash income, the costs are recovered from customers over the service life of the related plant in the form of increased revenue collected as a
result of higher depreciation expense. Changes in AFUDC rates are directly related to changes in short-term borrowing rates.

In accordance with the financial assurance policy of ISO-New England Inc. ISO-NE, NSTAR Electric had $17 million on deposit in an escrow account at December31, 2010. This policy was modified
during 2011 resulting in the refund of this deposit to NSTAR Electric. Accordingly, this deposit is presented as a Current assets: Restricted cash in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31, 2010. 
NSTARs banking arrangements provide for daily cash transfers to its disbursement accounts as vendor checks are presented for payment. These banking
arrangements do not permit the right of offset amongst subsidiaries cash accounts. As a result, credit balances of certain subsidiary disbursement accounts in the amounts of $322 million
68 Table of Contents
and $251 million, respectively, at December31, 2011 and 2010 are included in Current liabilities: Accounts payable on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in
the balances of the disbursement accounts are reflected in financing activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
11.Use of Fair Value NSTAR uses a fair
value hierarchy that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets, and is applicable to fair value measurements of derivative contracts and other instruments that are subject to mark-to-market accounting. Refer to Note M,
Fair Value Measurements, for more information. The fair value of financial instruments is estimated based on market
trading information, where available. Absent published market values for an instrument or other assets, management uses observable market data to arrive at its estimates of fair value. For its long-term debt, management estimates are based in part
on quotations from broker/dealers or interest rate information for similar instruments. The carrying amount of cash and temporary investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term borrowings and other current liabilities approximates
fair value because of the short maturity and/or frequent repricing of those instruments. In addition, the Company applies fair value
recognition provisions to estimate the fair value of its stock-based compensation. 12.Income Taxes 
Income tax expense includes the current tax obligation or benefit and the change in net deferred income tax liability for the period. Deferred income
taxes result from temporary differences between financial and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Income tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized when the company determines that it is more-likely-than-not that
the tax position will be ultimately sustained. Refer to Note H, Income Taxes, for more information. 13.Equity Method
of Accounting NSTAR uses the equity method of accounting for investments in corporate joint ventures in which it does not have a controlling
interest. Under this method, it records as income or loss the proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of the joint ventures with a corresponding increase or decrease in the carrying value of the investment. The investment is reduced as
cash dividends are received. NSTAR participates in several corporate joint ventures in which it has investments, principally its 145% equity investment in two companies, New England Hydro-Transmission Electric Company, Inc. NEH and New England
Hydro-Transmission Corporation NHH that own and operate transmission facilities and its 25% equity investments in Northern Pass Transmission LLC NPT, a joint venture with NU to build, own and operate a transmission facility to import electricity
from the Hydro-Quebec system in Canada. NSTAR also retains equity investments ranging from 4% to 14% in three regional nuclear facilities CY, MY, and YA, all of which have been decommissioned in accordance with the federal NRC procedures.

16.Purchase and Sales Transactions with ISO-NE NSTAR Electric has several remaining long-term power contracts that it sells through ISO-NE at daily market prices, which are not used to satisfy NSTAR Electrics Basic Service energy requirements.
NSTAR Electric is required by the DPU to credit all proceeds from these energy sales back to its customers. NSTAR Electric may not execute new long-term energy supply agreements without approval of the DPU. NSTAR records the proceeds from the sales
of these contracts as a reduction to Purchased power and transmission on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  YearsendedDecember31 in millions

17.Variable Interest Entities Amended consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entities became effective for NSTAR on January1, 2010. This amended guidance did not have an impact on the accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements. NSTAR Electric has certain long-term purchase power agreements with energy facilities where it purchases substantially
all of the output from a specified facility for a specified period. NSTAR has evaluated these arrangements under the variable interest accounting guidance and has determined that these agreements represent variable interests. NSTAR Electric is not
considered the primary beneficiary of these entities and does not consolidate the entities because it does not control the activities most relevant to the operating results of these entities and does not hold any equity interests in the entities.
NSTAR Electrics exposure to risks and financial 
70 Table of Contents
support commitments with respect to these entities is limited to the purchase of the power generated at the prices defined under the contractual agreements. NSTAR Electrics involvement with
these variable interest entities has no material impact on NSTARs financial position, financial performance, or cash flows. 
18.Subsequent Events Management has
reviewed subsequent events through the date of this filing and concluded that no material subsequent events have occurred that are not accounted for in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosed in the accompanying Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Note B.Sale of MATEP 
On June1, 2010, NSTAR completed the sale of its stock ownership interest in its district energy operations business, MATEP, for
$343 million in cash, to a joint venture comprised of Veolia Energy North America, a Boston-based subsidiary of Veolia Environnement and Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners. The sale resulted in a non-recurring, after-tax gain of $1099 million, including transaction costs, or $104 per share, for 2010. A portion of the sale proceeds was utilized to retire the $855 million
of MATEPs long-term Notes, together with a retirement premium of $18 million. The operating results of MATEP through May31, 2010
summarized below, have been separately classified and reported as discontinued operations on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.  in thousands

Net income from discontinued operations 116,955 9,233 
Effective December21, 2009, with the execution of a purchase and sale agreement, NSTAR ceased recording
depreciation and amortization expense on MATEP in accordance with MATEPs classification as a discontinued operation. Had NSTAR continued to record depreciation and amortization expense through May 2010 and in 2009, additional charges of $35
million and $05 million would have been recognized, respectively. 
Note C.Share Repurchase Program 
In connection with the sale of MATEP, NSTARs Board of Trustees approved a share repurchase program of up to $200 million of NSTAR
Common Shares. On June3, 2010, NSTAR entered into a $125 million Accelerated Share Repurchase ASR program with an investment bank,
which delivered to NSTAR 3,221,649 Common Shares under the ASR. In the fourth quarter of 2010, upon settlement of the ASR, NSTAR recorded a
final adjustment to common equity for the termination of the ASR reflecting the receipt of approximately $23 million in cash from the investment bank. No additional shares were delivered to NSTAR at the conclusion of the ASR. The excess of amounts
paid over par value for the 3,221,649 Common Shares delivered was allocated between Retained earnings and Premium on common shares in the Consolidated Statements of Common Shareholders Equity. 
71 Table of Contents
In conjunction with the announcement of the proposed NSTAR and NU merger, NSTAR elected to cease the
remaining $75 million of purchases of Common Shares that had been planned under the $200 million share repurchase program. 
Note D.Earnings Per Common Share 
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders, which includes a deduction for preferred dividends
of a subsidiary, by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the respective period. Diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the weighted average common shares are increased to include the impact of potential
nonvested shares and stock options granted stock-based compensation, in accordance with NSTARs Long Term Incentive Plan. The
following table summarizes the reconciling amounts between basic and diluted EPS:  in thousands, except per share amounts

The fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation ARO is recorded in the period in which it is incurred. When the
liability is initially recorded, NSTAR capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the
useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. The recognition of an ARO within NSTARs regulated utility businesses has no impact on its earnings. For its rate-regulated utilities, NSTAR establishes a regulatory asset to recognize future
recoveries through depreciation rates for the recorded ARO. NSTAR has certain plant assets in which this condition exists and is related to both plant assets containing hazardous materials and legal requirements to undertake remediation efforts upon
retirement. 
72 Table of Contents
A recorded asset retirement cost liability approximates the current cost for NSTAR to liquidate its legal or
contractual obligations to perform actions at some point after the retirement of an asset. The following amounts were included in Deferred credits and other liabilities: Other on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets: December31 in millions

For NSTARs regulated utility businesses, the ultimate cost to remove utility plant from service cost of removal
is recognized as a component of depreciation expense in accordance with approved regulatory treatment. The following amounts were based on the estimated cost of removal component in current depreciation rates and represent the cumulative amounts
collected from customers for cost of removal, but not yet expended:  December31 in millions
2011 2010 Regulatory liability - cost of removal 291 279 Note F.Regulatory Assets 
Under the traditional revenue requirements model, electric and gas rates are based on the cost of providing energy delivery service.
Accounting rules require companies to defer the recognition of certain costs when incurred if future rate recovery of those costs is probable. This is applicable to NSTARs electric and gas distribution and transmission operations. 
Regulatory assets represent costs incurred that are probable of recovery from customers through future rates in accordance with agreements with
regulators. These costs are expensed when the corresponding revenues are received in order to appropriately match revenues and expenses. 
Regulatory assets consisted of the following:  December31 in thousands
2011 2010 Retiree benefit costs 1,180,697 963,172 Goodwill 557,741 577,901 Securitized and other energy-related costs 368,520 496,416 Energy contracts including Yankee units 154,908 222,245 Income taxes, net 47,856 25,250 Redemption premiums 18,171 20,748 Purchased energy costs 1,964 5,249 Other 141,332 143,492 
Total current and long-term regulatory assets 2,471,189 2,443,975 
Amortization expense recorded to Depreciation and amortization on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Income on certain regulatory assets for 2011, 2010, and 2009, was $1120 million, $1253 million, and $1909 million, respectively. The amortization of other regulatory assets is recorded to Purchased power and transmission on the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Retiree benefit costs 
Retiree benefit-related regulatory assets at December31, 2011 and 2010 are $1,1807 million and $9632 million, respectively. Refer to Note I,
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, for further details. NSTAR recovers its qualified pension and PBOP expenses through a reconciling rate mechanism PAM. NSTAR 
73 Table of Contents
recognizes a regulatory asset as an offset for the liability that is recognized for the funded status of the Pension and PBOP plans, because NSTAR will eventually recover these amounts in rates
when they are recognized in expense. At December31, 2011, this asset was $353 million for the Pension Plan and $3228 million for the PBOP Plan. At December31, 2010, these amounts were $2474 million and $2531 million, respectively.
NSTAR does not earn a carrying charge on these amounts. NSTAR does earn a carrying charge in accordance with PAM on the excess cumulative
contributions it has made over what it has cumulatively recognized as expense. At December31, 2011 and 2010, these balances were $447 million and $395 million of the retiree benefit regulatory asset, respectively. 
The remainder of regulatory assets in this category consist of deferred costs of $579 million and $677 million at December31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. These earn a carrying charge based on short-term interest rates. In March 2010, the President signed the PPACA and the HCERA
into law. These laws changed the tax treatment for retiree prescription drug expenses by eliminating the tax deduction available to the extent that those expenses are reimbursed under Medicare Part D, beginning in 2013. Because the tax benefits
associated with these future deductions were reflected as deferred income tax assets in the consolidated financial statements, the elimination of the tax deductions resulted in a reduction in deferred tax assets of $174 million. As a result of its
rate recovery mechanism, NSTAR established a regulatory asset for this amount to reflect the anticipated future collection from customers due to the law change. NSTAR also established an additional regulatory asset of $112 million and a related
increase in deferred tax liabilities to reflect a tax gross-up for revenue requirement purposes. The tax law change had no material impact to NSTARs reported earnings. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the remaining regulatory asset related to
this matter was $19 million and $28 million, respectively, which are included in the balances above. Goodwill 
The Companys goodwill originated from the merger that created NSTAR in 1999. As a result of a rate order from the DPU approving the merger, the
Company is recovering goodwill from its customers and, therefore, NSTAR has determined that this rate structure allows for amortization of goodwill over the collection period. Goodwill along with related deferred income taxes is being amortized over
40 years, through 2039, without a carrying charge. Securitized and other energy-related costs 
A portion of these energy-related regulatory assets constitute Transition Property collateralizing the Securitization Certificates issued by NSTAR
Electrics subsidiaries, BEC Funding LLC, BEC Funding II, LLC and CEC Funding, LLC. The collateralized amounts at December31, 2011 and 2010 were $984 million and $1827 million, respectively. The certificates are non-recourse to NSTAR
Electric. The activities of BEC Funding LLC were substantially completed as of March31, 2010 and the Company was dissolved on April14, 2010. Also included are other costs related to purchase power contract divestitures and certain costs related to NSTAR Electrics former generation business that are recovered with a return through the
transition charge and amounted to $2598 million and $2965 million at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These cost recoveries primarily occur through September 2016 for NSTAR Electric and are subject to adjustment by the DPU.
The remaining energy-related regulatory assets consist of other transition costs and other recoverable charges of $103 million and $172
million at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Energy contracts 
At December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, $1096 million and $1742 million represent the contract termination liability related to certain
purchase power contract buy-out agreements that NSTAR Electric executed in 2004 and their future recovery through NSTAR Electrics transition charge. Since no cash outlay was 
74 Table of Contents
incurred by NSTAR, NSTAR recognized this regulatory asset as a result of recording the contract termination liability. NSTAR does not earn a return on this regulatory asset. The contracts
termination payments will occur over time and will be collected from customers through NSTARs transition charge over the same time period. The cost recovery period of these terminated contracts is through September 2016. 
The unamortized balance of the costs to decommission the CY, YA, and MY nuclear power plants was $308 million and $392 million at December31,
2011 and 2010, respectively. All three nuclear units were notified by the NRC that their respective former plant sites were decommissioned in accordance with NRC procedures and regulations. NSTARs liability for CY decommissioning and its
recovery ends at the earliest in 2015, for YA in 2014, and for MY in 2013. However, should the actual costs exceed current estimates, NSTAR could have an obligation beyond these periods that would be fully recoverable. These costs are recovered
through NSTAR Electrics transition charge. NSTAR does not earn a return on decommissioning costs, but a return is included in rates charged to NSTAR by these plants. Refer to Note P, Commitments and Contingencies, for
further discussion. At December31, 2011 and 2010, $112 million and $64 million, respectively, represent the recognition of the future
recoverability of a net derivative liability recorded related to contracts structured to hedge a portion of NSTAR Gas future supply purchases. NSTAR Gas does not earn a return on these balances. Settled amounts would be refunded or collected
from customers no later than 18 months from the settlement date. The remaining balances at December31, 2011 and 2010 of $34 million and $24 million, respectively, represent an asset recorded to offset a derivative liability recorded for the
fair value of a long-term renewable energy contract. Refer to Note G, Derivative Instruments, for further details. Income taxes, net The principal holder of this regulatory asset is NSTAR Electric. This
regulatory asset balance reflects deferred tax reserve deficiencies that are currently being recovered from customers and excludes a return component. Partially offsetting these amounts is a regulatory liability associated with unamortized
investment tax credits relating to NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas. The increase from 2010 to 2011 is due primarily to adjusting deferred taxes for amounts previously flowed-through to customers for regulatory purposes. 
Redemption premiums These
amounts reflect the unamortized balance of redemption premiums on NSTAR Electric Debentures that are amortized and recovered over the life of the respective debentures pursuant to DPU approval. The decrease reflects the amortization of these
redemption premiums. There is no return recognized on this balance. Purchased energy costs 
The purchased energy costs at December31, 2011 and 2010 relate to deferred electric Basic Service and gas supply costs. Basic Service is the
electricity that is supplied by NSTAR Electric when a customer has chosen not to receive service from a competitive supplier. The market price for Basic Service and gas supply costs may fluctuate based on the average market price for energy. Amounts
incurred for Basic Service and cost of gas supply are recovered on a fully reconciling basis without a return. The over-collected position of purchased energy costs is presented as a reduction of regulatory assets rather than as a regulatory
liability. This is because the amount of the over-collected Basic Service and CGAC positions is exceeded by regulatory assets that will be collected from the same classes of retail electric and gas customers that these over-collected Basic Service
and CGAC positions will be returned to. Other Amounts included consist of deferred transmission costs, DPU-approved safety and reliability program costs, other DPU costs, and asset retirement obligation costs. Deferred transmission costs represent
the difference between the level of billed transmission revenues and the current period costs incurred to provide transmission-related services that will be recovered over a subsequent twelve-month period with carrying charges. The costs
75 Table of Contents
associated with safety and reliability programs are pending a decision by the DPU. See DPU Safety and Reliability Programs CPSL in Note P, Commitments and Contingencies. The
costs associated with clean up of former gas manufacturing sites are recovered over a seven-year period without a return. 
Note G.Derivative Instruments 
Energy Contracts NSTAR Electric has determined that it is not required to account for the majority of its electricity supply contracts as derivatives because they qualify for, and NSTAR Electric has elected, the normal
purchases and sales exception. As a result, these agreements are not reflected on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. NSTAR Electric has a long-term renewable energy contract that does not qualify for the normal purchases and sales
exception and is valued at an estimated $34 million and $24 million liability as of December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. NSTAR Electric has measured the difference between the cost of this contract and projected market energy costs over
the life of the contract, and recorded a long-term derivative liability and a corresponding long-term regulatory asset for the value of this contract. Changes in the value of the contract have no impact on earnings. 
NSTAR Gas has only one significant natural gas supply contract. This contract is an all-requirements portfolio asset management contract that expires in
October 2012. The following costs were incurred and recorded to Cost of gas sold on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income:  YearsendedDecember31 in millions
2011 2010 2009 Natural gas supply costs incurred on NSTAR Gas all-requirements contract 127 139 177
Refer to the accompanying Item7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,
for a further discussion. Natural Gas Hedging Agreements In accordance with a DPU order, NSTAR Gas purchases financial contracts based upon NYMEX natural gas futures in order to reduce cash flow variability associated with the purchase price for approximately
one-third of its natural gas purchases. This practice attempts to minimize the impact of fluctuations in prices to NSTARs firm gas customers. These financial contracts do not procure natural gas supply, and qualify as derivative financial
instruments. The fair value of these instruments is recognized on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as an asset or liability representing amounts due from or payable to the counter parties of NSTAR Gas, as if such contracts were settled
as of the balance sheet date. All actual costs incurred or benefits realized when these contracts are settled are included in the CGAC of NSTAR Gas. NSTAR Gas records a regulatory asset or liability for the market price changes, in lieu of recording
an adjustment to Other Comprehensive Income. These derivative contracts extend through April 2013. As of December31, 2011, these natural gas hedging agreements, representing fourteen individual contracts, hedged 11,450 BBtu. The settlement of
these contracts may have a short-term cash flow impact. Over the long-term, any such effects are mitigated by a regulatory recovery mechanism for those costs. Potential counterparty credit risk is minimized by collateral requirements as specified in credit support agreements to the contracts that are based on the credit rating of the counterparty and the fair
value exposure under each contracts term. In the event of a downgrade in the credit rating of either party, these agreements may require that party to immediately collateralize, by either cash payment, letter of credit, or other qualifying
security instrument, any exposure that exists for obligations in excess of specified threshold amounts. 
76 Table of Contents
NSTAR Gas is also subject to this credit risk-related contingent feature. Based on market conditions at the
time of a downgrade, NSTAR Gas could be required to post collateral in an amount that could be equal to or less than the fair value of the liability at the time of the downgrade. As of December31, 2011, NSTAR Gas has an A+ Standard
Poors Issuer credit rating. Collateral obligations are required in the event of a downgrade below an A rating by Standard Poors and/or if the fair value of the contract exceeds established credit thresholds. Based on NSTAR Gas
liability position with its gas hedge contract counterparties as of December31, 2011, should NSTAR Gas credit rating be downgraded the collateral obligations described below would result:  Credit Ratings Downgraded to LevelBelowA

In addition, these agreements contain cross-default provisions that would allow NSTAR Gas and its counterparties to
terminate and liquidate a gas hedge contract if either party is in default on other swap agreements with that same counterparty, or another unrelated agreement with that same counterparty in excess of stipulated threshold amounts.

NSTAR recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts
and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Net regulatory assets of $48 million and $25 million and corresponding net increases in accumulated deferred income taxes were recorded as of December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase
from prior year is due primarily to recording deferred income taxes on amounts previously flowed-through to customers for regulatory purposes. The regulatory assets represent the additional future revenues to be collected from customers for deferred
income taxes. Accumulated deferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax credits consisted of the following: December31 in thousands

Settlement with IRS Office of Appeals of RCN Corporation RCN Share Abandonment Issue 
On September30, 2010, NSTAR accepted a settlement offer from the IRS Office of Appeals IRS Appeals on issues related to its 2001-2007 Federal
income tax returns. This development resolved all outstanding tax matters related to this period, including the RCN share abandonment issue. 
As previously disclosed, on December24, 2003, NSTAR formally abandoned 116million shares of RCN common stock. NSTAR deducted the share
abandonment on its 2003 Federal income tax return as an ordinary loss. The settlement with IRS Appeals includes a resolution on the characterization of the loss related to the RCN share abandonment. In 2010, NSTAR recognized a one-time after-tax
charge of $205 million, including interest, related to the settlement on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income as follows:  in millions

Receipt of Federal Tax Refund for 2001-2007 Tax Years On April21, 2011, NSTAR received a $1433 million refund from the IRS relating to the 2001-2007 tax years. The approved settlement and receipt of the refund resolves all outstanding tax matters for
these years. Open Tax Years 
The 2011 Federal income tax return is being reviewed under the IRS Compliance Assurance Process CAP. CAP accelerates the examination of the return in
order to resolve issues before the tax return is filed. The outcome and the timing of any potential audit adjustments are uncertain. All years prior to 2011 have been examined by the IRS. Uncertain Tax Positions As of December31, 2011 and 2010, there were no unrecognized
tax benefits of a permanent nature that if recognized would have an impact on the Companys effective tax rate. NSTAR did not have a reserve for uncertain tax positions at December31, 2011 and 2010. 
Interest on Tax Positions NSTAR

NSTAR recognizes an asset or liability on its balance sheet for the funded status of its Pension and PBOP Plans. The pension asset or
liability is the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the projected benefit obligation as of year-end. For other postretirement benefit plans, the asset or liability is the difference between the fair value of the
plans assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of year-end. As a result of NSTARs approved regulatory rate mechanism for recovery of pension and postretirement costs, NSTAR has recognized a regulatory asset for the
majority of its pension and postretirement costs in lieu of taking a charge to AOCI. 1.Pension 
NSTAR provides a defined benefit retirement plan, the NSTAR Pension Plan the Pension Plan, that covers substantially all employees. Retirement benefits
are based on various final average pay formulas. NSTAR also maintains a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan for certain management employees. The Pension Plans use December31st for the measurement date to determine their projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the purposes of determining the Plans funded status and the net periodic benefit costs for
the following year. The following tables for NSTARs Pension Plans present the change in benefit obligation, change in the Plans
assets, the funded status, the components of net periodic benefit cost and key assumptions used:  Years Ended December31 in thousands

2. Postretirement Benefits Other than Pension PBOP 
NSTAR provides health care and other benefits to retired employees who meet certain age and years of service eligibility requirements. Under certain
circumstances, eligible retirees are required to contribute to the costs of postretirement benefits. These benefits are not vested and the Company has the right to modify any benefit provision, including contribution requirements, with respect to
any current or former employee, dependent or beneficiary. NSTAR provides prescription drug benefits to retirees that are at least actuarially
equivalent to the benefits provided under Medicare Part D. NSTAR receives subsidies to provide prescription drug programs for eligible former employees age 65 and over, in the form of direct cash payments. The subsidy reduces NSTARs PBOP
benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefits cost. However, as a result of the PAM, these reductions do not have a material impact on reported earnings.  YearsendedDecember31 in millions

3. Pension and PBOP Plan Assets Investment objectives: The primary investment goal of the Pension Plan is to achieve a
return equal to or better than the median corporate plan over the long-term. Risk is regularly evaluated, compared and benchmarked to plans with a similar investment strategy. The Plan also attempts to minimize risk by not having any single security
or class of securities with a disproportionate impact on the Plan. NSTAR currently uses over 20 asset managers to manage its plans assets. As a guideline, assets are diversified by asset classes Equity, Fixed Income, Real Estate, Alternative
Investments and within these classes i.e., economic sector, industry, such that, for each asset manager:  No more than 6% of an asset managers equity portfolio market value may be invested in one company  Each equity portfolio should be invested in at least 20 different companies in different industries  No more than 50% of each equity portfolios market value may be invested in one industry sector, and  No more than 5% of a fixed income managers portfolio may be invested in the security of an issuer, except the U.S. Government and its agencies.
The PBOP Plans primary investment goal is to earn returns comparable to peers and appropriate benchmarks.

Investments stated at fair value as determined by quoted market prices for identical assets Level 1 include:  Shares of registered investment companies valued at fair value as determined by quoted market prices, based upon net asset value NAV
Domestic and foreign common equity securities and real estate investment trusts valued using quoted market prices of a national securities exchange
U.S. Government securities valued on an active trading market  Futures contracts valued at the last settlement price at the end of each day on the exchange upon which they are traded 
Investments stated at estimated fair value using significant observable inputs Level 2 include:  Interest bearing cash in an institutional short-term investment vehicle valued daily  Fixed income investments consisting of domestic and foreign corporate bonds, foreign government securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and
other securitized vehicles are valued on the basis of valuations furnished by a pricing service, which determines valuations using methods based on market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships between securities, which are
generally recognized by institutional traders  Domestic preferred equity securities valued by a pricing service  Common/collective trusts valued at NAV without adjustment Investments valued at estimated fair value using significant unobservable inputs Level 3 include:  Hedge funds and limited partnerships valued at NAV without adjustment  An immediate participation guarantee contract with an insurance company stated at contract value, which approximates fair value
Significant Investment Risks of Level 3 Investments: Certain real estate limited partnerships have long-term lock-up provisions 7-10 years that are intended to allow for an orderly investment and dissolution of the partnership as the underlying properties
are sold. Certain hedge funds have instituted temporary redemption restrictions as of December31, 2011. Others have monthly, quarterly or annual restraints on redemptions or may require advance notice for a redemption. Management does not
believe that these liquidity restrictions impair the Plans ability to transact redemptions at NAV, which the Plans utilize for fair value for those investments. The Pension Plan also had $26 million of unfunded investment commitments to real estate limited partnerships at December31, 2011. These commitments must be fulfilled by June 2013.

The election available to participants to reinvest dividends paid on the NSTAR Common Share Fund or receive the dividends
in cash is subject to a freeze period beginning seven days prior to the date any dividend is paid. During this period, participants cannot change their election. 
Note J. Stock-Based Compensation 
The NSTAR 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan the 2007 Plan permits a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including stock options,
deferred stock awards, and performance share units to be granted to key employees. The aggregate number of NSTAR Common Shares that have initially been authorized for issuance under the 2007 Plan is 35 million. The Plan limits the terms of awards
to ten years and prohibits the granting of awards beyond ten years after its effective date. In general, stock options and deferred shares vest over a three-year period from date of grants. Performance share units vest only at the end of a
three-year performance period if performance conditions are met. The performance share units granted prior to 2011 may potentially vest at target pursuant to change in control provisions if the NSTAR-NU merger is completed. The Executive Personnel
Committee EPC of the Board of Trustees approves stock-based awards for executives. However, the Chief Executive Officers CEO award must also be approved by the independent members of the Board of Trustees. The EPC and Board of Trustees
established that the date of grant for annual stock-based awards under the Plan is the date each year on which the Board of Trustees approves the CEOs stock award. Options are granted at the full market price of

The stock options granted in 2010 and 2009 have the following grant date fair value: 2010 2009 Grant date fair value stock options 487 364  92 Table of Contents
NSTAR did not grant any stock options during 2011. 
The fair value was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the assumptions in the table below. The expected option lives are
based on the average historical time frame that options are expected to remain unexercised. Expected volatilities are based on the historical performance of NSTARs share price. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury Strip in
effect on grant date. The fair values were computed using the following range of assumptions for NSTARs stock options for the years ended December31:  2010 2009 Expected life years 60 60 Risk-free interest rate 287 189 Volatility 229 200 Dividends 472 443 Deferred Shares:  2011Activity  2010Activity  Nonvested deferred shares at January1 259,705 3447 259,022 3415 Deferred shares granted 144,100 4326 142,450 3528 Deferred shares vested 125,333 3400 132,567 3471 Deferred shares forfeited 2,567 3912 9,200 3458

Performance share unit awards PSUs under the 2007 Plan contain performance criteria that affect the number of shares
that ultimately vest. Restrictions on performance share unit awards lapse after a three-year period contingent on achievement of certain earnings growth. These awards grant the right to receive, at the end of the performance period, a variable
number of shares based on the average growth of NSTARs earnings over three years, and a three-year total shareholder return that is compared to companies in the EEI Index. This variable

Management evaluates the probability of meeting the performance criteria at each balance sheet date and related
compensation cost is amortized over the performance period on a straight-line basis. If the performance is not achieved, no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed. The performance share units
granted in 2008 and 2009 vested on January24, 2011 and January22, 2012, respectively. Total Stock-Based
Compensation As of December31, 2011, the total stock-based compensation cost related to nonvested stock options, deferred share
awards and PSUs not yet recognized was $106 million. The remaining weighted average period over which total stock-based compensation will be recognized is 173 years. Total stock-based compensation cost recognized in Operations and maintenance on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and the costs related to stock options that are included in

Deferred shares and PSUs granted in 2011 and 2012 will not vest at the closing of the NSTAR-NU merger. The PSUs and
deferred shares will convert to deferred share awards of NU shares if the merger closes, and will vest according to the same terms as NSTAR deferred shares.

NSTAR Electric has two outstanding series of non-mandatory redeemable preferred stock. Both series are part of a class of
NSTAR Electrics Cumulative Preferred Stock. Upon any liquidation of NSTAR Electric, holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock are entitled to receive the liquidation preference for their shares before any distribution to the holder of the
NSTAR Common Shares. The liquidation preference for each outstanding series of Cumulative Preferred Stock is equal to the par value $10000 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. During the year ended December31, 2011 and 2010, there were no changes in the noncontrolling interest of NSTAR Electric. NSTAR is required to reflect NSTAR Electrics noncontrolling interest preferred stock as noncontrolling interest of a subsidiary in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets outside of permanent
equity. Each of the two preferred stock series contains provisions relating to non-payment of preferred dividends that could potentially result in the preferred shareholders being granted the majority control of the Board of Directors of NSTAR
Electric until all preferred dividends are paid. As a result, the Cumulative Preferred Stock has not been classified within permanent equity. The dividends on NSTAR Electrics Cumulative Preferred Stock to the noncontrolling interest are
reflected separately after net income and before net income attributable to common shareholders on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The dividends are reported as comprehensive income attributable to the noncontrolling interest on
the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

Consistent with the recovery in utility rates, discounts, redemption premiums and related costs associated with the
issuance and redemption of long-term debt of NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas are deferred and amortized as an addition to interest expense over the life of the original or replacement debt. On April6, 2009, the DPU approved NSTAR Electrics two-year financing plan to issue an additional $500 million in long-term debt securities. On October9, 2009, in connection with this
filing, NSTAR and NSTAR Electric filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to issue debt securities from time to time in one or more series. On November17, 2009, NSTAR sold $350 million of fixed rate 45%Debentures due
November15, 2019. NSTAR used the proceeds from the issuance of these securities for the repayment of outstanding short-term debt balances and general working capital purposes. 
96 Table of Contents
NSTAR Electric anticipates filing a new two-year financing plan with the DPU during 2012 seeking approval to
issue long-term debt securities. On January28, 2010, NSTAR Gas issued $125 million of its 446% fixed rate 10-year First Mortgage
Bonds, Series N. The proceeds from this sale were used to reduce short-term debt. On August1, 2011, NSTAR Electric redeemed $15 million
of Massachusetts Industrial Finance Agency Bonds, 575%, due February 2014, at par. Sewage facility revenue bonds are tax-exempt, subject to
annual mandatory sinking fund redemption requirements and mature through 2015. Scheduled redemptions of $165 million were made in 2011 and 2010. The interest rate of the bonds was 7375% for both 2011 and 2010. 
The Transition Property Securitization Certificates issued by NSTAR Electrics subsidiaries, BEC Funding LLC, BEC Funding II, LLC and CEC Funding,

Financial Covenant Requirements and Lines of Credit With the exception of bond indemnity agreements and gas hedging agreements, NSTAR has no financial guarantees, commitments, debt or lease agreements that would require a change in terms and conditions,
such as acceleration of payment obligations, as a result of a change in its credit rating. However, in addition to the bond indemnity and gas hedging agreements, NSTARs subsidiaries could be required to provide additional security for energy
supply contract performance obligations, such as a letter of credit for their pro-rata share of the remaining value of such contracts. NSTAR
and NSTAR Electric have no financial covenant requirements under their respective long-term debt arrangements. Pursuant to a revolving credit agreement, NSTAR Electric must maintain a total debt to capitalization ratio no greater than 65% at all
times. The prescribed ratio is calculated excluding both Transition Property Securitization Certificates from debt and accumulated other comprehensive income loss from common equity. The ratio characterizes as debt unfunded vested benefits under
postretirement benefit plans, contract liability positions including swaps and hedges, capital lease liabilities, and corporate guarantees. NSTAR Gas 
97 Table of Contents
must also maintain a total debt to capitalization ratio no greater than 65% at all times pursuant to its revolving credit agreement. NSTAR Gas was in compliance with its financial covenant
requirements including a minimum equity requirement, under its long-term debt arrangements at December31, 2011 and 2010. Under the minimum equity requirement, the outstanding long-term debt of NSTAR Gas must not exceed equity. NSTARs
long-term debt, other than secured debt issued by NSTAR Gas, is unsecured. NSTAR currently has a $175 million revolving credit agreement that
expires December31, 2012. At December31, 2011 and 2010, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. This credit facility serves as a backup to NSTARs $175 million commercial paper program that, at
December31, 2011 and 2010, had $170 million and $160 million outstanding, respectively. Under the terms of the credit agreement, NSTAR is required to maintain a maximum total consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than
65% at all times. The prescribed ratio is calculated excluding both Transition Property Securitization Certificates from debt and accumulated other comprehensive income loss from common equity. The ratio characterizes as debt unfunded vested
benefits under postretirement benefit plans, contract liability positions including swaps and hedges, capital lease liabilities, and corporate guarantees. Commitment fees must be paid on the total agreement amount. At December31, 2011 and
2010, NSTAR was in full compliance with the aforementioned covenant as the ratios were 556% and 569%, respectively. In mid-February 2010,
NSTAR retired its $500 million, 8% Notes as scheduled. On March16, 2010, NSTAR Electric sold $300 million of 550% Debentures due March15, 2040. NSTAR and NSTAR Electric used the proceeds from the issuance of these securities for the
redemption or repayment of outstanding long-term debt and short-term debt balances and/or general working capital purposes. NSTAR Electric
has approval from the FERC to issue short-term debt securities from time to time on or before October22, 2012, with maturity dates no later than October21, 2013, in amounts such that the aggregate principal does not exceed $655 million
at any one time. NSTAR Electric has a five-year, $450 million revolving credit agreement that expires December31, 2012. However, unless NSTAR Electric receives necessary approvals from the DPU, the credit agreement will expire 364 days from
the date of the first draw under the agreement. At December31, 2011 and 2010, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. This credit facility serves as backup to NSTAR Electrics $450 million commercial paper
program that had $1415 million and $2275 million outstanding balances at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. At December31, 2011 and 2010, NSTAR Electric was in full compliance with its covenants in connection with its short-term
credit facilities, as the total debt to capitalization ratios were 454% and 466%, respectively. In connection with the pending merger with
Northeast Utilities, NSTAR and NSTAR Electric received waivers and executed amendments to their revolving credit agreements necessary to allow completion of the merger. NSTAR Gas has a $75 million revolving credit facility. This facility is due to expire on June8, 2012. As of December31, 2011 and 2010, NSTAR Gas had no amounts outstanding. At
December31, 2011 and 2010, NSTAR Gas was in full compliance with its covenant in connection with its facility, as the total debt to capitalization ratios were 516% and 533%, respectively. 
Historically, NSTAR and its subsidiaries have had a variety of external sources of financing available, as previously indicated, at favorable rates and
terms to finance its external cash requirements. However, the availability of such financing at favorable rates and terms depends heavily upon prevailing market conditions and NSTARs or its subsidiaries financial condition and credit
ratings. NSTARs goal is to maintain a capital structure that preserves an appropriate balance between debt and equity. As of
December31, 2011, NSTARs subsidiaries could declare and pay dividends of up to approximately $13 billion of their total common equity approximately $25 billion to NSTAR and remain in compliance with debt covenants. Based on
NSTARs key cash resources available as previously discussed, management believes its liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to meet its current and projected cash requirements.

NSTAR discloses fair value measurements pursuant to a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP. NSTAR follows a fair
value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to determine fair value and requires the Company to classify assets and liabilities carried at fair value based on the observability of these inputs. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are: Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Financial assets utilizing Level 1 inputs include active exchange-traded equity
securities. Level 2 - Quoted prices available in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar
assets or liabilities in inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable, and inputs derived principally from market data. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs from objective sources. These inputs may be based on entity-specific inputs. Level3 inputs include all inputs that do not meet the requirements of Level 1 or Level 2.
Gas hedges were valued at calculated settlement prices. The renewable energy contract was valued based on the difference between the
contracted price and the estimated fair value of remaining contracted supply to be purchased. Inputs used to develop the estimate included on-line regional generation and forecasted demand. The following represents the fair value hierarchy of NSTARs financial assets and liabilities that were recognized at fair value on a recurring basis as of December31, 2011 and 2010. Financial
assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

For the purpose of providing segment information, NSTARs principal operating segments are its traditional core businesses of
electric and gas retail transmission and distribution utilities that provide energy delivery services in 107 cities and towns in Massachusetts. 
In the second quarter of 2010, with the completion of the sale of MATEP, NSTAR changed its reportable segments and recast prior period information to
conform with the current year presentation that eliminates separate presentation of the Companys unregulated operations. Although the telecommunications and liquefied natural gas subsidiaries are separate legal entities, NSTAR has aggregated
the results of operations and assets of its telecommunications subsidiary with the electric utility operations, and aggregated the liquefied natural gas service subsidiary with gas utility operations. The telecommunications subsidiary, liquefied
natural gas service subsidiary and MATEP were previously aggregated as unregulated operations for purposes of segment reporting. Since the sale of MATEP, it is no longer necessary to present the unregulated segment separately due to immateriality.
The new segment presentation reflects the ongoing profile of NSTARs operations as primarily comprised of electric and gas utility operations. Amounts related to discontinued operations have been excluded from the data presented. Amounts shown on the following table for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 include the allocation
of NSTARs Holding Company results of operations and assets to the two business segments, net of inter-company transactions that primarily consist of interest charges and investment assets, respectively. The allocation of Holding Company
charges is based on an indirect allocation of the Holding Companys investment relating to the two business segments.

Note O.Contracts for the Purchase of Energy 
NSTAR Electric Purchase Power Agreements As a Massachusetts distribution company, NSTAR Electric is required to obtain and resell power to retail customers through Basic Service for those who choose not to buy energy from a competitive energy
supplier. Basic Service rates are reset every six months every three months for large commercial and industrial customers. The price of Basic Service is intended to reflect the average competitive market price for power. For Basic Service power
supply, NSTAR Electric makes periodic market solicitations consistent with DPU 
102 Table of Contents
regulations. NSTAR Electric enters into short-term power purchase agreements to meet its Basic Service supply obligation, ranging in term from three to twelve months. NSTAR Electric fully
recovers its payments to suppliers through DPU-approved rates billed to customers. NSTAR Gas Firm Transportation and Storage
Agreements NSTAR Gas purchases transportation, storage, and balancing services from Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company and Algonquin Gas
Transmission Company, as well as other upstream pipelines that transport gas from major producing regions in the U.S., including Gulf Coast, Mid-continent, and Appalachian Shale supplies to the final delivery points in the NSTAR Gas service area.
NSTAR Gas purchases all of its natural gas supply from a firm portfolio management contract with a term of one year, which has a maximum quantity of 139,606 MMbtu/day. NSTAR Gas has various contractual agreements covering the transportation of natural gas and underground natural gas storage facilities, which are recoverable from customers under the DPU-approved CGAC.
Most contracts expire at various times from 2012 to 2017. One new 20-year pipeline lateral contract was signed in 2009 and a low cost storage contract was extended by ten years in 2011. NSTAR Gas firm contract demand charges associated with

Service Quality Indicators SQI are established performance benchmarks for certain identified measures of service quality relating to customer service and billing performance, safety and reliability and DPU Consumer Division
statistics performance for all Massachusetts utilities. NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas are required to report annually to the DPU concerning their performance as to each measure and are subject to maximum penalties of up to two and one-half percent of
total transmission and distribution revenues should performance fail to meet the applicable benchmarks. NSTAR monitors its service quality
continuously, and if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and is estimable, a liability is accrued. Any settlement or rate order that would result in a different liability level from what has been accrued would be adjusted in the period
that the DPU issues an order determining the amount of any such liability. NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas filed final performance reports for
2010 with the DPU on March1, 2011. The NSTAR Gas report has been approved and the NSTAR Electric report is pending a decision. Based on the reports filed, no penalties were assessable for the performance year. 
NSTAR believes that NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas service quality performance levels for 2011 were not in a penalty situation. The final performance
reports are expected to be filed with the DPU by March1, 2012. Emergency Preparation and Restoration of Service for
Electric Gas Customers Under Massachusetts law and regulation, the DPU has established standards of performance for emergency
preparation and restoration of service for gas and electric companies.As a remedy to violation of those standards, the DPU is authorized to levy a penalty not to exceed $250,000 for each violation for each day that the violation persists up to
a maximum penalty of $20 million for any related series of violations. NSTAR believes that it is not in a penalty situation with respect to
the performance of NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas during declared emergency events to date.

Transmission NSTAR Electric is a member of ISO-NE and is subject to the terms and conditions of the ISO-NE tariff. NSTAR Electric must pay for regional network services to support the pooled transmission facilities
revenue requirements of other New England transmission owners whose facilities are used by NSTAR Electric. NSTAR Electric must, along with other transmission owners and market participants, fund a proportionate share of the RTOs operating and
capital expenditures. These payments were as follows:  Years ended December31 in millions
2011 2010 2009 Regional network transmission expense 2284 2357 1826
Energy Commitments NSTAR is currently recovering payments it is making to suppliers from its customers. NSTAR has financial and performance assurances and financial guarantees in place with those suppliers to protect NSTAR
from risk in the unlikely event any of its suppliers encounter financial difficulties or fail to maintain an investment grade credit rating. This condition principally relates to NSTAR Electrics energy supply contract to provide Basic Service
to its customers. In connection with certain of these agreements, in the event NSTAR Electric should receive a credit rating below investment grade, it would be required to obtain certain financial commitments, including but not limited to, letters
of credit. Refer to Note O, Contracts for the Purchase of Energy for a further discussion.

Electric capacity obligations represent remaining capacity costs of long-term contracts that reflect NSTAR
Electrics proportionate share of capital and fixed operating costs of certain generating units. Transmission obligations represent the
obligation to support the carrying costs of facilities utilized. Gas transportation and storage obligations represent agreements covering the
transportation of natural gas and underground natural gas storage facilities that are recoverable from customers under the DPU-approved CGAC. These contracts expire at various times from 2012 through 2029. 
Gas purchase obligations is the estimated amount to be paid to NSTAR Gas portfolio manager to meet customer demand and replenish inventory. 
Renewable electric energy contract obligations represent projected payments under long-term agreements. 
Purchase power buy-out obligations represent the buy-out/restructuring agreements for contract termination costs that reduce the amount of above-market
costs that NSTAR Electric will collect from its customers through its transition charges. These agreements require NSTAR Electric to make monthly payments through September 2016. Electric energy contracts Basic Service represent obligations under Basic Service load provider agreements. The electric interconnection agreement relates to a single interconnection with a municipal utility for additional capacity into NSTAR Electrics service territory. 
Electric Equity Investments 
NSTAR Electric has an equity investment of approximately 145% in two companies, NEH and NHH, which own and operate transmission facilities to import
electricity from the Hydro-Quebec system in Canada. As an equity participant, NSTAR Electric is required to guarantee, in addition to its own share, the obligations of those participants who do not meet certain credit criteria. 
NSTAR Electric has an equity ownership of 14% in CY, 14% in YA, and 4% in MY, collectively, the Yankee Companies. CY, YA and MY plant sites have been
decommissioned in accordance with NRC procedures. Amended licenses continue to apply to the ISFSIs where spent nuclear fuel is stored at these sites. CY, YA and MY remain responsible for the security and protection of the ISFSI and are
required to maintain radiation monitoring programs at the sites. NU also owns direct interests in the three Yankee companies. Should the NSTAR-NU merger close, the combined NSTAR and NU ownership would exceed 50% for CY and YA. 
105 Table of Contents
The accounting for decommissioning and/or security or protection costs of these three decommissioned nuclear
power plants involves estimates from Yankee Companies management and reflect total remaining costs of approximately $39 million to be incurred for CY, YA and MY. Changes in these estimates will not affect NSTARs results of operations or
cash flows because these costs will be collected from customers through NSTAR Electrics transition charge filings with the DPU. Yankee Companies Spent Fuel Litigation NSTAR Electric is part owner of three decommissioned New
England nuclear power plants, Connecticut Yankee CY, Yankee Atomic YA and Maine Yankee MY the Yankee Companies. The Yankee Companies have been party to ongoing litigation at the Federal level with respect to the alleged failure of the
Department of Energy DOE to provide for a permanent facility to store spent nuclear fuel generated in years through 2001 for CY and YA, and through 2002 for MY DOE Phase I Damages. NSTAR Electrics portion of the Phase I judgments amounts
to $48 million, $46 million, and $3 million, respectively. The case has been going through the appeal process in the Federal courts, oral arguments were held in November 2011 and a final decision on this appeal could be received by May 2012.
In 2009, the Yankee Companies also filed for additional damages related to the alleged failure of the DOE to provide for a permanent facility
to store spent nuclear fuel generated in years after 2001 for CY and YA and after 2002 for MY DOE Phase II Damages. Claim amounts applicable to Phase II for NSTAR Electric are $19 million, $12 million, and $17 million, respectively. 
NSTAR cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these pending decisions. However, should the Yankee Companies ultimately prevail, NSTAR Electrics
share of the proceeds received would be refunded to its customers. Financial and Performance Guarantees 
On a limited basis, NSTAR and certain of its subsidiaries may enter into agreements providing financial assurance to third parties. 
At December31, 2011, outstanding guarantees totaled $292 million as follows:  in thousands Surety Bonds 25,694 Hydro-Quebec Transmission Company Guarantees 3,459 
Total Guarantees 29,153 
Surety Bonds As of December31, 2011, certain of NSTARs subsidiaries have purchased a total of $22 million of performance surety bonds for the purpose of obtaining licenses, permits and rights-of-way in
various municipalities. In addition, NSTAR and certain of its subsidiaries have purchased approximately $235 million in workers compensation self-insurer bonds. These bonds support the guarantee by NSTAR and certain of its subsidiaries to the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, required as part of the Companys workers compensation self-insurance program. NSTAR and certain of its subsidiaries have indemnity agreements to provide additional financial security to its bond company in
the form of a contingent letter of credit to be triggered in the event of a downgrade in the future of NSTARs Senior Note rating to below BBB by SP and/or to below Baa2 by Moodys. These indemnity agreements cover both the
performance surety bonds and workers compensation bonds.

Hydro-Quebec Transmission Company Guarantees 
NSTAR Electric has issued approximately $35 million of residual value guarantees related to its equity interest in the Hydro-Quebec Transmission
Companies, NEH and NHH. Management believes the likelihood that NSTAR would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses
associated with any of these guarantees is remote. Environmental Matters 
NSTAR subsidiaries face possible liabilities as a result of involvement in several multi-party disposal sites, state-regulated sites or third party claims
associated with contamination remediation. NSTAR generally expects to have only a small percentage of the total potential liability for the majority of these sites. As of December31, 2011 and 2010, NSTAR had liabilities of $13 million and
$09 million, respectively, for these environmental sites. This estimated recorded liability is based on an evaluation of all currently available facts with respect to these sites. NSTAR Gas is participating in the assessment or remediation of certain former MGP sites and alleged MGP waste disposal sites to determine if and to what extent such sites have been contaminated and
whether NSTAR Gas may be responsible to undertake remedial action. The DPU permits recovery of costs associated with MGP sites over a 7-year period, without carrying costs. As of December31, 2011 and 2010, NSTAR had a liability of
approximately $10 million and $159 million, respectively, as an estimate for site cleanup costs for several MGP sites for which NSTAR Gas was identified as a potentially responsible party. A corresponding regulatory asset was recorded that reflects
the future rate recovery for these costs. Estimates related to environmental remediation costs are reviewed and adjusted as further
investigation and assignment of responsibility occurs and as either additional sites are identified or NSTARs responsibilities for such sites evolve or are resolved. NSTARs ultimate liability for future environmental remediation costs
may vary from these estimates. Based on NSTARs current assessment of its environmental responsibilities, existing legal requirements, and regulatory policies, NSTAR does not believe that these environmental remediation costs will have a
material adverse effect on NSTARs consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Regulatory and Legal
Proceedings Rate Settlement Agreement 
NSTAR Electric is operating under a DPU-approved Rate Settlement Agreement Rate Settlement Agreement that expires December31, 2012. From 2007
through 2012, the Rate Settlement Agreement establishes for NSTAR Electric, among other things, annual inflation-adjusted distribution rates including a productivity offset, that are generally offset by an equal and corresponding adjustment in
transition rates. The rates as of January1 were as follows:  January1 2012 2011 2010 2009 Annual inflation-adjusted distribution rate - SIP increase decrease 096 019 132 174 The adjustment increase will be 096% of distribution revenues, effective January1, 2012. Due to low inflation
factors and a productivity offset, there was a slight distribution rate reduction effective January1, 2011. Uncollected transition charges as a result of the reductions in transition rates are deferred and collected through future rates with a
carrying charge. The Rate Settlement Agreement implemented a 50% / 50% earnings sharing mechanism based on NSTAR Electrics distribution return on equity excluding incentives should it exceed 125% or fall below 85%. Should the return on
equity fall below 75%, NSTAR Electric may file a request for a general rate increase. NSTAR Electric did not exceed the 125%, or fall below the 85% distribution return on equity during 2011, 2010 or 2009.

Pursuant to a 2008 DPU order, Massachusetts electric utilities must adopt rate structures that decouple the
volume of energy sales from the utilitys revenues in their next rate case. The exact timing of the next rate case has not yet been determined. DPU Safety and Reliability Programs CPSL As part of the Rate Settlement Agreement, NSTAR
Electric recovers incremental costs related to the double pole inspection, replacement/restoration and transfer program and the underground electric safety program, which includes stray-voltage remediation and manhole inspections, repairs, and
upgrades. Recovery of these Capital Program Scheduling List CPSL billed costs is subject to DPU review and approval. From 2006 through 2011, NSTAR Electric has incurred a cumulative incremental revenue requirement of approximately $83 million,
including $17 million incurred in 2011. These amounts include incremental operations and maintenance and revenue requirements on capital investments. On May28, 2010, the DPU issued an order on NSTAR Electrics 2006 CPSL costs recovery filing. The expected recovery amount did not vary materially from the revenue previously recognized. On
October8, 2010, NSTAR Electric submitted a Compliance Filing with the DPU reconciling the recoverable CPSL Program revenue requirement for each year 2006 through 2009 with the revenues already collected to determine the proposed adjustment
effective on January1, 2011. The DPU allowed the proposed rates to go into effect on that date, subject to reconciliation of program costs. NSTAR cannot predict the timing of subsequent DPU orders related to this filing. Should an adverse DPU
decision be issued, it could have a material adverse impact on NSTARs result of operations, financial position, and cash flows. 
Wholesale Power Cost Savings Initiatives The
Rate Settlement Agreement includes incentives to encourage NSTAR Electric to continue its efforts to advocate on behalf of customers at the FERC to mitigate wholesale electricity cost inefficiencies that would be borne by regional customers. As a
result of its role in two RMR cases, NSTAR Electric had sought to collect $98 million annually for three years and began collecting some of these incentive revenues from its customers effective January1, 2007, subject to final DPU approval.
Through December31, 2009, approximately $189 million had been collected from customers for the Wholesale Power Cost Savings Initiatives. 
On November30, 2009, the DPU denied NSTAR Electrics petition. NSTAR Electric refunded the $189 million to customers in 2010. The DPU order
had no impact on earnings as the Company did not reflect the amounts collected in revenues. Basic Service Bad Debt Adder 
On July1, 2005, in response to a generic DPU order that required electric utilities in Massachusetts to recover the energy-related portion of bad
debt costs in their Basic Service rates, NSTAR Electric increased its Basic Service rates and reduced its distribution rates for those bad debt costs. In furtherance of this generic DPU order, NSTAR Electric included a bad debt cost recovery
mechanism as a component of its Rate Settlement Agreement. This recovery mechanism bad debt adder allows NSTAR Electric to recover its Basic Service bad debt costs on a fully reconciling basis. These rates were implemented, effective
January1, 2006, as part of NSTAR Electrics Rate Settlement Agreement. On February7, 2007, NSTAR Electric filed its 2006
Basic Service reconciliation with the DPU proposing an adjustment related to the increase of its Basic Service bad debt charge-offs. This proposed rate adjustment was anticipated to be implemented effective July1, 2007. On June28, 2007,
the DPU issued an order approving the implementation of a revised Basic Service rate. However, the DPU instructed NSTAR Electric to reduce distribution rates by the increase in its Basic Service bad debt charge-offs. Such action would result in a
further reduction to distribution rates from the adjustment NSTAR Electric made when it implemented the Settlement Agreement. This adjustment to NSTAR Electrics distribution rates would eliminate the fully reconciling nature of the Basic
Service bad debt adder. 
108 Table of Contents
NSTAR Electric has not implemented the directives of the June28, 2007 DPU order. Implementation of
this order would require NSTAR Electric to write-off a previously recorded regulatory asset related to its Basic Service bad debt costs. NSTAR Electric filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the DPUs order on July18, 2007. On May28,
2010, the DPU issued an order and reaffirmed that NSTAR Electric should reduce its distribution rates by the increase in its Basic Service bad debt charge-offs. On June18, 2010, NSTAR Electric filed an appeal of the DPUs order with the
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court SJC. In October 2010, the SJC allowed a stay of the DPUs order pending appeal. Briefs were filed during the summer of 2011 and oral arguments were held on December8, 2011. A decision by the SJC is
expected in the first half of 2012. As of December31, 2011, the potential pre-tax impact to earnings of eliminating the fully reconciling nature of the bad debt adder would be approximately $22 million. NSTAR cannot predict the exact timing of
this appeals process or the ultimate outcome. NSTAR Electric continues to believe that its position is appropriate and that it is probable upon appeal that it will ultimately prevail. FERC Proceeding Regarding Base ROE of New England Transmission Operators On September30,
2011, the Attorney General of Massachusetts and other ratepayer advocates representing the six New England states, filed a complaint with the FERC seeking to reduce the 1114% base return on equity Base ROE used in calculating formula rates for
transmission service under the ISO-NE Open Access Transmission Tariff OATT. A change in the Base ROE would adversely impact the investor-owned utilities New England Transmission Owners, or NETOs, including NSTAR Electric, that own transmission
facilities within the footprint of ISO-NE, which serves as the regional transmission organization for New England. On October20, 2011,
NSTAR Electric along with the other NETOs, filed their response with the FERC. In that response, the NETOs vigorously defended the appropriateness of the current FERC-approved Base ROE. The NETOs requested that the FERC summarily dismiss the
complaint. Should any unfavorable ruling by FERC result in a reduction of the Base ROE, the exposure would be limited to OATT rates assessed following the complaint date of September30, 2011. NSTAR cannot predict the timing or outcome of this
proceeding. As of December31, 2011, NSTAR Electric has estimated that each 10 basis point change in the authorized base ROE would
change annual earnings by approximately $05 million. Legal Matters In the normal course of its business, NSTAR and its subsidiaries are involved in certain legal matters, including civil litigation, for which it has appropriately recognized legal liabilities. Management
has reviewed the range of reasonably possible court-ordered damages, settlement amounts, and related litigation costs legal liabilities that could be in excess of amounts accrued and amounts covered by insurance, and determined that the range of
reasonably possible legal liabilities would not be material. Based on the information currently available, NSTAR does not believe that it is probable that any such legal liabilities will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position.
However, it is reasonably possible that additional legal liabilities that may result from changes in circumstances could have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To Shareholders and Trustees of NSTAR: In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under a1 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of NSTAR and its subsidiaries the Company at December31, 2011 and 2010 and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under a2 present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As discussed in Note A
to the consolidated financial statements, the Company signed an Agreement and Plan of Merger on October16, 2010 with Northeast Utilities. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
