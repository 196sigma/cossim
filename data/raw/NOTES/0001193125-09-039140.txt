of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2007, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the UnitedStates of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed
its method of accounting for its equity-based compensation to conform to FASB Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payment as of January 1, 2006 and the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1,

CommScope,Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements In Thousands, Unless Otherwise Noted 1.BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS CommScope, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries CommScope or the Company is a world
leader in infrastructure solutions for communication networks. Through its Andrew brand, the Company is a global leader in radio frequency subsystem solutions for wireless networks.
Through its SYSTIMAX and Uniprise brands, CommScope is also a world leader in network infrastructure solutions for business
enterprise applications. CommScope is also the premier manufacturer of coaxial cable for broadband cable television networks and one of the leading North American providers of environmentally secure cabinets for digital subscriber line DSL and
Fiber-to-the-Node applications.  2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Consolidation The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include CommScope and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Cash and Cash
Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents represent deposits in banks and cash invested temporarily in various instruments with a maturity
of three months or less at the time of purchase. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory cost is determined on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis for substantially all of the Companys inventories. Costs such as idle facility expense,
excessive spoilage and rehandling costs are recognized as expenses as incurred. The Company maintains reserves to reduce the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market, including reserves for excess and obsolete inventory. Long-Lived Assets Property, Plant and Equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, including interest costs associated with qualifying capital additions. Provisions for depreciation
are based on estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Useful lives generally range from 10 to 35years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 10years for machinery and equipment. Expenditures for repairs and
maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Assets that management intends to dispose of and that meet held for sale criteria are carried at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is
assigned to reporting units, which are generally one level below the operating segment level, based on the difference between the purchase price as allocated to the reporting units and the fair value of the net assets acquired as allocated to the
reporting units. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at their 
58 Table of Contents CommScope,Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued In Thousands,
Unless Otherwise Noted 
estimated fair values at the time of acquisition less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the respective assets see Note4. Amortization related to intangible assets utilized in the production of goods is included within cost of sales. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of
these intangibles may no longer be recoverable. During the three months ended December31, 2008, the Companys management determined that an indication of potential goodwill impairment existed due to the sustained decrease in the
Companys market capitalization below book value along with the consideration of certain 2009 budgeting activities that indicated lower operating results for certain reporting units than had been previously forecasted. As a result of the
goodwill impairment testing required by SFAS No142, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $297 million in 2008. No impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives was identified during 2007 or 2006.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be derived from the use and ultimate disposition of the assets. Assets identified as impaired are carried at fair
value. During the three months ended December31, 2008, as a result of reduced expectations of future cash flows from certain identified intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Andrew, the Company determined that these assets were
impaired. A pretax impairment charge of $97 million was recognized primarily related to certain customer relationship intangible assets. Due to uncertain market conditions, it is possible that future impairment reviews may indicate additional impairments of goodwill and/or other intangible assets, which could result in charges that are material to the Companys results
of operations. Income Taxes Deferred
income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance, when appropriate, to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is
more likely than not to be realized. The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No48
FIN48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No109 as of January1, 2007 and recognized the impact of implementing FIN48 as an adjustment to Retained Earnings. Under
FIN48, tax benefits that result from uncertain tax positions may be recognized only if they are considered more likely than not to be sustainable, based on their technical merits. The amount of benefit to be recognized is the largest amount of
tax benefit that is at least 50% likely to be realized. The cumulative amount of undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries for
which no U.S. taxes have been provided was $5890million as of December31, 2008. In addition, the Company does not provide for U.S. taxes related to the foreign currency transaction gains and losses on its long-term intercompany loans
with foreign subsidiaries. These loans are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future, and the foreign currency gains and losses are therefore recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss.

Unless Otherwise Noted 
Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably
assured. The majority of CommScopes revenue comes from product sales. Revenue from product sales is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer and revenue is measurable. Revenue is not recognized related to
product sold to contract manufacturers that the Company anticipates repurchasing in order to complete the sale to the ultimate customer. Certain customer arrangements include sales of software and services. Revenue for software products is recognized pursuant to the provisions of SOP No97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, and related interpretations. The
fair value of each revenue element is determined based on vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value determined by stand-alone pricing of each element. These contracts typically contain post-contract support PCS services which are sold both
as part of a bundled product offering and as a separate contract. Revenue for PCS services is recognized ratably over the term of the PCS contract. Other service revenue is typically recognized when the service is performed. Revenue for certain of the Companys products is derived from multiple-element contracts. The fair value of the revenue elements within these
contracts is based on stand-alone pricing for each element in accordance with the guidance provided in EITF 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, and related interpretations. Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances, returns and rebates. In addition, accruals are
established for price protection programs with distributors at the time the related revenue is recognized. These estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms, inventory levels in the
distributor channel and other related factors. Product Warranties The Company recognizes a liability for the estimated claims that may be paid under its customer warranty agreements to remedy potential deficiencies of quality or performance of the Companys products. These
product warranties extend over periods ranging from one to twenty-five years from the date of sale, depending upon the product subject to the warranty. The Company records a provision for estimated future warranty claims as cost of sales based upon
the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales and specifically identified warranty issues. The Company bases its estimates on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates, as appropriate,
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary. Shipping and Handling Costs CommScope includes shipping and handling costs billed to customers in net sales and includes the costs incurred to transport product to customers as cost
of sales. Certain internal handling costs, which relate to activities to prepare goods for shipment, are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense and were approximately $78 million in 2008, $73million in 2007 and
$61million in 2006. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Advertising expense was $154million in 2008, $38million in 2007 and $33million in 2006. 
60 Table of Contents CommScope,Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued In Thousands,
Unless Otherwise Noted 
Research and Development Costs Research and development RD costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. RD costs include materials, equipment and facilities that have no alternative future use, depreciation on equipment
and facilities currently used for RD purposes, personnel costs, contract services and reasonable allocations of indirect costs, if clearly related to an RD activity. Expenditures in the pre-production phase of an RD project are
recorded as RD expense. However, costs incurred in the pre-production phase that are associated with output actually used in production are recorded in cost of sales. A project is considered finished with pre-production efforts when management
determines that it has achieved acceptable levels of scrap and yield, which vary by project. Expenditures related to ongoing production are recorded in cost of sales. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities CommScope is exposed to risks resulting from adverse
fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. CommScopes risk management strategy includes the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments as hedges of these risks, whenever management
determines their use to be reasonable and practical. This strategy does not permit the use of derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, nor does it allow for speculation. A hedging instrument may be designated as a net investment hedge
to manage exposure to foreign currency risks related to an investment in a foreign subsidiary; a fair value hedge to manage exposure to risks related to a foreign-currency-denominated cash or other account or a firm commitment for the purchase of
raw materials or equipment; or a cash flow hedge to manage exposure to risks related to a forecasted purchase of raw materials, variable interest rate payments or a forecasted foreign-currency-denominated sale of product. The use of non-derivative
financial instruments in hedging activities is limited to hedging fair value risk related to a foreign-currency-denominated firm commitment or a foreign currency risk related to a net investment in a foreign subsidiary. The Companys risk management strategy permits the reasonable and practical use of derivative hedging instruments such as forward contracts,
options, cross currency swaps, certain interest rate swaps, caps and floors, and non-derivative hedging instruments such as foreign-currency-denominated loans. The Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments as assets or liabilities and
measures them at fair value. All hedging instruments are designated and documented as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a net investment hedge at inception. For fair value hedges, the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is
recognized currently in earnings. To the extent the fair value hedging relationship is effective, the change in fair value of the hedged item is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognized currently in
earnings. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss, net of tax, and is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations
when the hedged item affects earnings. Any ineffectiveness of a cash flow hedge is recognized currently in earnings. For net investment hedges, the effective portion of the change in fair value of a derivative instrument, or the change in carrying
amount of a non-derivative instrument, is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss, net of tax, and is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations only if there is a substantially complete liquidation of the investment
in the foreign subsidiary. Any ineffectiveness of a net investment hedge is recognized currently in earnings. The effectiveness of designated hedging relationships is tested and documented on at least a quarterly basis. At December31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had a cross-currency swap designated as a hedge. In December 2007, the Company entered into an interest
rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge to mitigate the cash flow effects of interest rate fluctuations on interest expense for a portion of its variable-rate debt instruments. See Note9 for further disclosure related to the derivative
instruments and hedging activities.

Unless Otherwise Noted 
The Company also uses derivative instruments such as forward exchange contracts to manage the risk of
foreign currency fluctuations. These instruments are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculation. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and are marked to market each period through earnings and, as such,
there were no unrecognized gains or losses as of December31, 2008 or 2007. The Company has elected and documented the use of the
normal purchases and sales exception for normal purchase and sales contracts that meet the definition of a derivative financial instrument. Foreign
Currency Translation For the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, approximately 53%, 33% and 32%, respectively, of the
Companys net sales were to customers located outside the U.S. A portion of these sales were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, particularly sales from the Companys foreign subsidiaries. The financial position and
results of operations of certain of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Revenues and expenses of these subsidiaries have been translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange
rates prevailing during the period. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries have been translated at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Translation gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss.
Aggregate foreign currency transaction gains and losses of the Company and its subsidiaries, such as those resulting from the settlement
of receivables or payables and short-term intercompany advances in a currency other than the subsidiarys functional currency, are recorded currently in earnings and resulted in gains losses of $117 million, $05 million, and $01
million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to long-term intercompany loans that are not expected to be settled in the foreseeable future are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive
income loss. Earnings Loss Per Share Basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings loss per share is based on net income loss adjusted for after-tax
interest and amortization of debt issuance costs related to convertible debt, if dilutive, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted for the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock units, performance
share units and convertible securities.

The calculation of diluted earnings loss per share for the year ended December31, 2008 excludes the dilutive effect of 08million stock options, 07million
restricted stock units and performance share units, and 97million convertible senior subordinated debentures because they would have decreased the loss per share. c
Options to purchase approximately 10million and 06million common shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings loss per share, for the years ended
December31, 2008 and 2006, respectively, because they would have been antidilutive. No options to purchase common shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended December31, 2007. For additional
information regarding employee stock options, see Note13. Equity-Based Compensation On January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payment, using the modified prospective transition method to
account for its equity-based compensation arrangements. The Company previously applied Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations and provided the required
pro forma disclosures of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. The adoption of SFAS No123R did not materially affect the accounting for the equity-based compensation associated with the Companys
previously awarded phantom stock or performance units, which was already based on the market price of the stock at date of grant. Under the modified prospective transition method, new and previously granted but unvested equity awards are recognized
as compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations based on the estimated fair value of the award net of estimated forfeitures at the grant date, and prior period results are not restated. The Company estimates the fair value of
stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The balance previously reflected as deferred equity compensation a contra-equity account was eliminated against additional paid-in capital APIC upon adoption of SFAS No123R.
63 Table of Contents CommScope,Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued In Thousands,
Unless Otherwise Noted 
With the adoption of SFAS No123R, the Company changed its method of expense attribution for
equity-based compensation for future awards from recognition over the nominal vesting period to recognition over the requisite service period. Compensation expense for equity-based awards granted prior to January1, 2006 continued to be
recognized over the nominal vesting period. For the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, additional pretax compensation expense of $12million, $12 million and $11 million, respectively, was recognized due to the continued use
of the nominal vesting period for awards that were granted prior to January1, 2006 to retirement-eligible employees. The Company
records deferred tax assets related to compensation expense for awards that are expected to result in future tax deductions for the Company, based on the amount of compensation cost recognized and the Companys statutory tax rate in the
jurisdiction in which it expects to receive a deduction. Differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and actual tax deductions reported on the Companys income tax return are recorded in APIC if the
tax deduction exceeds the deferred tax asset or in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as additional income tax expense if the deferred tax asset exceeds the tax deduction and no excess APIC exists from previous awards. SFAS No123R requires the benefit of tax deductions in excess of the compensation costs recognized for those options to be classified as
financing cash inflows. As a result of utilizing the simplified alternative provided under FSPFAS123R-3, $62million, $167million and $181 million of tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options that were
vested as of the adoption of SFAS No123R were classified as financing cash inflows for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Use of Estimates in the Preparation of the Financial Statements The preparation of the accompanying
consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. These estimates and their underlying assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other objective sources. The Company bases its estimates
on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates, as appropriate, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary. Significant
accounting estimates reflected in the Companys financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts; reserves for sales returns, discounts, allowances, rebates and distributor price protection programs; inventory excess and
obsolescence reserves; product warranty reserves and other contingent liabilities; tax valuation allowances and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits; purchase price allocations; impairment reviews for investments, fixed assets, goodwill and
other intangibles; and pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities. Although these estimates are based on managements knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on managements assumptions about future
events, it is at least reasonably possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results. Concentrations of Risk Non-derivative financial instruments used by the Company in the normal course of business include letters of credit and commitments to extend credit,
primarily accounts receivable. These financial instruments involve risk, including the credit risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to those instruments, and the maximum potential loss may exceed the reserves provided in the Companys
balance sheet. See Note16 for further discussion of customer-related concentrations of risk. The Company manages its exposures to
credit risk associated with accounts receivable using such tools as credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures. CommScope estimates the allowance for doubtful 
64 Table of Contents CommScope,Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued In Thousands,
Unless Otherwise Noted 
accounts based on the actual payment history and individual circumstances of significant customers as well as the age of receivables. In managements
opinion, as of December31, 2008, the Company did not have significant unreserved risk of credit loss due to the nonperformance of customers or other counterparties related to amounts receivable. However, an adverse change in financial
condition of a significant customer or group of customers or in the telecommunications industry could materially affect the Companys estimates related to doubtful accounts. The principal raw materials purchased by CommScope copper, fabricated aluminum, steel, brass, plastics and other polymers, bimetals and optical fiber
are subject to changes in market price as these materials are linked to various commodity markets. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks through effective requirements planning and by working closely with its key suppliers to obtain the best
possible pricing and delivery terms. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141 revised 2007, Business Combinations SFAS No141R. SFAS
No141Rmodifies how acquirers recognize and measure the consideration transferred, identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interests and goodwill acquired in a business combination. SFAS
No141Rrequires that acquisition related expenses and restructuring costs be expensed. SFAS No141Rwill be implemented as of January1, 2009 and will generally be effective, on a prospective basis, for transactions
consummated on or after January1, 2009. Provisions of SFAS No141Rrelated to the accounting for certain income tax assets and liabilities will also be effective for acquisitions completed prior to the effective date. As the
impact of adopting SFAS No141R is dependent on future acquisitions, the Company is unable to determine the impact of adopting SFAS No141R. In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements SFAS No160. SFAS No160 establishes requirements for ownership
interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the Company i.e.,minority interests to be shown separate from the parents equity within the equity section of the consolidated statement of financial position. Changes in the
parents ownership interests are required to be accounted for as equity transactions and any noncontrolling equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries must be measured initially at fair value. SFAS No160 will be implemented, on a
prospective basis, as of January1, 2009. Presentation and disclosure requirements must be retrospectively applied to comparative financial statements. SFAS No160 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys
consolidated financial position and results of operations. In February2008, the FASB issued FSP No.FAS 157-2, Effective
Date of FASB Statement No157 which delayed the effective date of SFAS No157 as it applies to non-financial assets and liabilities that are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring at least annual basis. As a
result of the delay, SFAS No157 will be applied to the Companys non-financial assets and liabilities as of January1, 2009. SFAS No157 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial
position and results of operations. In March2008, the FASB issued SFAS No161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activitiesan amendment of FASB Statement No133 SFAS No161. SFAS No161 expands required disclosure about an entitys derivative instruments and hedging activities and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November15, 2008. In April2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP No.FAS 142-3,
Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets, which amends guidance regarding the assumptions used in determining the useful lives of intangible assets that may be renewed or extended. This FSP is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December15, 2008 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 
65 Table of Contents CommScope,Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued In Thousands,
Unless Otherwise Noted 
In May2008, the FASB issued FSP No.APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt
Instruments That MayBe Settled in Cash Upon Conversion Including Partial Cash Settlement, which requires the liability and equity components of convertible debt to be accounted for separately with interest expense recognized on the
liability component at a non-convertible debt borrowing rate. This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008 and is required to be applied retrospectively to all past periods presented. The Company does not expect this
FSP to have an impact on its current or prior consolidated financial statements. 3.ACQUISITIONS Andrew Corporation On December27, 2007,
CommScope completed its acquisition of Andrew. The total purchase price consisted of approximately $23billion in cash and approximately 51million shares of CommScope common stock, with a value of approximately $255million. The
cash portion of the purchase price was funded primarily through $21billion of borrowings under new senior secured credit facilities see Note8. As of December31, 2008, the following represents the Companys estimate of the
acquisition date fair values of each major asset and liability category of Andrew in millions:  EstimatedFairValue

126 The identifiable intangible assets were determined by management to have finite lives. The useful
lives for the customer base were based on managements forecasts of customer turnover, sales levels with major customers and types of customers as of the acquisition date. The useful lives for the trade names and trademarks were estimated based
on the periods that the trade names and trademarks have been in use and the absence of a definite plan to discontinue their use in the foreseeable future. The useful lives for the patents and technologies were based on review of historical lives of
similar products, in conjunction with technology-specific factors and anticipated future trends in the industry as well as the remaining lives of the related patents. The goodwill arising from the purchase price allocation is believed to be consistent with Andrews reputation in the marketplace which is expected to lead to sales to new customers, synergies expected to be
realized from the acquisition and the going concern value of the assembled Andrew business. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The Andrew amounts included in the following proforma information are based on Andrews historical results and, therefore, may not be indicative of the actual results when operated as part of CommScope. The
proforma adjustments represent managements best estimates based on information available at the time the proforma information was prepared and may differ from the adjustments that may actually have been required. Accordingly, the
proforma financial information should not be relied upon as being indicative of the historical results that would have been realized had the acquisition occurred as of the date indicated or that may be achieved in the future. The following table presents proforma consolidated results of operations for CommScope for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 as
though the acquisition had been completed as of January1, 2007 and 2006, respectively in millions, except per share amounts:  Unaudited 2007 2006 Revenue 4,1499 3,7775 Net loss 1557 768 Net loss per share 234 121
These pro forma results reflect pro forma adjustments for net interest expense, depreciation,
amortization and related income taxes. No pro forma adjustment has been made to reverse asset impairments or to provide a tax benefit for Andrews actual net losses. The 2007 pro forma results include pretax impairment charges of approximately
$161 million related to Andrews historical goodwill and long-lived assets, certain Andrew

investments and Andrews Satellite Communications business. The 2007 pro forma results also include a $45 million pretax charge related to the
TruePosition litigation judgment see Note 15. During 2007 and 2006, Andrew incurred pretax acquisition-related costs of $36 million and $13 million, respectively, that are included in the pro forma results above. The 2006 pro forma results also
include the impact of recording a valuation allowance for deferred taxes of $83 million. Net loss during 2008 includes certain charges
benefits that relate directly or indirectly to the acquisition, as listed below on a pretax basis inmillions:  2008 Purchase accounting inventory adjustment 597 Alignment of certain employee benefit policies 122
The Company has initiated changes to various employee benefits to align benefit structures in
conjunction with the integration of Andrew and CommScope. As a result of changes implemented during the year ended December31, 2008, the Company recognized a benefit of $122 million which is reflected as a reduction of selling, general and
administrative expenses. On January31, 2008, the Company sold the Satellite Communications SatCom product line, acquired as part
of the Andrew acquisition, to ASC Signal Corporation ASC. The Company received $85million in cash, $25million in notes receivable due April30, 2011, a 179% ownership interest in ASC and the potential for up to an additional
$250million of cash if certain financial targets are met over a three year period from the date of the divestiture. In addition, the Company expects to receive an additional note receivable for $25million also due April30, 2011,
upon completion of certain inventory and manufacturing asset transfers. The SatCom product line had net sales of $16 million for 2008 and $103 million for 2007 prior to the acquisition of Andrew. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale of
SatCom. On March26, 2008, the Company entered into an agreement to divest its minority interest in Andes Industries,Inc.
Andes, which had been acquired as part of the Andrew acquisition. The agreement was approved by the United States Department of Justice on April24, 2008 and the transaction was consummated on April28, 2008. No gain or loss was
recognized on the disposal of the Andes interest. Signal Vision,Inc. On May1, 2007, CommScope acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain current liabilities of Signal Vision,Inc., a leading
supplier of broadband radio frequency subscriber products, for approximately $190million, of which $185million was paid in cash and the balance is payable in 2009. The acquisition is included within the Broadband segment and resulted
in net sales of $196 million and $165million for the years ended December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Andrew, the Company determined that these assets were not recoverable and consequently recorded intangible asset impairment charges of $910 million for customer base intangible assets and $56
million for patents and technologies intangible assets. The fair value of the intangible assets was estimated using a discounted cash flow method. Of the intangible asset impairment charge, $768 million relates to the WNS segment and $198 million
relates to the ACCG segment.

During 2008, the Companys management determined that an indication of potential goodwill
impairment existed due to the sustained decrease in the Companys market capitalization below book value along with the consideration of certain 2009 budgeting activities that indicated lower operating results for certain reporting units than
were previously forecast. After completing the goodwill impairment testing, which included estimating the fair value of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow method, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $1945 million and
$1028 million related to the WNS and ACCG segments, respectively. The following table presents the allocation of the remaining goodwill balance to reportable segments as of December31, 2008 in millions:  Goodwill allocation ACCG 7086

CommScope and The Furukawa ElectricCo.,Ltd. Furukawa. After the Company sold its interest in OFS BrightWave to Furukawa in 2004, CommScope determined that there was an other-than-temporary impairment in the $30 million note receivable
and reduced the carrying value of the note to zero. On June30, 2006, CommScope agreed to accept and received $298million plus accrued interest in full satisfaction of the amount owed by OFS BrightWave and the note agreement was
terminated. The recovery of the OFS BrightWave note receivable resulted in a 2006 pretax gain of $298million $186million after-tax, or $026 per diluted share.

6.RESTRUCTURING CHARGE AND EMPLOYEE TERMINATION BENEFITS During the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded net restructuring charges of $376 million, $10 million and $126
million, respectively. The net restructuring charges for the year ended December31, 2008 include $253 million of charges related to the closure of the Companys legacy CommScope Belgian and Brazilian manufacturing facilities and a $28
million charge related to the closure of the Companys legacy CommScope Australian manufacturing facility. The Belgian and Brazilian facilities primarily supported the Broadband segment while the Australian facility supported the Enterprise
segment. The majority of the remainder of the 2008 restructuring costs resulted from workforce reductions at several facilities. The restructuring costs incurred during 2008 resulted from an effort to lower the overall manufacturing cost structure
of the Company following the Andrew acquisition and in response to a slowdown in demand for most major product groups. The Companys pretax restructuring charges recognized by segment during the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
were as follows:  2008

Employee-related costs include the expected severance costs and related benefits, accrued over the
remaining period employees are required to work in order to receive severance benefits. Lease termination costs relate to the cost of vacating leased facilities, net of anticipated sub-rental income. Equipment relocation costs relate to the costs to
uninstall, pack, ship and reinstall manufacturing equipment as well as the costs to prepare the receiving facility to accommodate the equipment. The Company expects to have substantially completed these restructuring actions by late 2009, though it
is likely that there will be additional restructuring charges and such charges could be material. As a result of restructuring and
consolidation actions, there is unutilized real estate at various facilities in the U.S. and internationally, which is recorded in property, plant and equipment on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at the lower of cost or estimated fair
value. The Company is attempting to sell or lease this unutilized space. As additional restructuring initiatives are implemented, additional excess property may be identified and impairment charges, which may be material, may be incurred.

$25billion. The Company amended the senior secured credit facilities on December24, 2008, as described below. The senior secured credit facilities consist of a $135billion term loan that matures on December27, 2014 the
seven-year senior secured term loan, a $750million term loan that matures on December27, 2013 the six-year senior secured term loan, and a $400million revolving credit facility that matures on December27, 2013. In
connection with entering into and amending the senior secured credit facilities, the Company incurred costs of approximately $396million, which were capitalized as other assets and are being amortized over the terms of the facilities. The
senior secured credit facilities are secured by substantially all of the Companys assets and are guaranteed by all of the Companys active domestic subsidiaries. The seven-year senior secured term loan, as amended, is required to be
repaid with $1061 million as part of the estimated excess cash flow payment due in March 2009 and quarterly installments of $28 millionwith a final payment of all outstanding principal and interest at maturity on December27, 2014. The
six-year senior secured term loan, as amended, is required to be repaid with $520 million as part of the estimated excess cash flow payment due in March 2009 and quarterly installments of $106million on December31, 2011 475million from March31, 2012 to December31, 2012, and $871million from March31, 2013 to December27, 2013. As of December31, 2008, $183billion was outstanding under the term loans and there were no
outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. However, availability under the revolving credit facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit and a limitation based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in
the credit agreement. The Companys availability under the revolving credit facility 
73 Table of Contents CommScope,Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued In Thousands,
Unless Otherwise Noted 
was $2033million as of December31, 2008. In addition, availability under the revolving credit facility will be automatically and permanently
reduced by an amount equal to 100% of the amount, if any, by which the Companys cash payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its 1% convertible senior subordinated debentures exceed $100 million in the aggregate. On September30, 2008, the Company made a voluntary $100 million prepayment of the six-year senior secured term loan. On December26, 2008, as
required by the amendment to the senior secured credit facilities, the Company made a $150 million prepayment of the term loans. As a result of these prepayments, the Company wrote off $29 million in deferred financing fees to interest expense
during 2008. Outstanding principal under the seven-year senior secured term loan bears interest at a rate equal to, at the Companys
option, either 1the base rate which is the highest of the then current Federal Funds rate plus 05%, the prime rate most recently announced by Bank of America, N.A., the administrative agent under the senior credit facilities, and the
one-month Eurodollar rate plus 10% plus a margin of 150% or 2the adjusted one, two, three or six-month London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus a margin of 250%. Outstanding principal under the six-year senior secured term loan and the
revolving credit facility bears interest at a rate equal to, at the Companys option, either 1the base rate plus a margin of 125%, or 2the adjusted one, two, three or six-month LIBOR plus a margin of 225%. The undrawn portion
of the revolving credit facility is subject to an unused line fee calculated at an annual rate of 050%. Pricing of the six-year senior secured term loan, the revolving credit facility and the unused line fee for the revolving credit facility are
determined by reference to a pricing grid based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio for the four-quarter period then ended. Under the pricing grid, the applicable margins for the six-year senior secured term loan and the revolving
credit facility range from 075% to 125% for base rate loans and from 175% to 225% for LIBOR loans, and the unused line fee for the revolving credit facility ranges from 0375% to 050%. Outstanding letters of credit are subject to an annual fee
equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR loans under the revolving credit facility as in effect from time to time, plus a fronting fee on the undrawn amount at an annual rate of 025%. The senior secured credit facilities are subject to mandatory prepayment based upon specified percentages of the net cash proceeds of certain asset
dispositions, casualty events, and debt and equity issuances, in each case subject to certain conditions. The senior secured credit facilities are also subject to a mandatory annual prepayment in an amount equal to 50% of excess cash flow,
calculated based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA, changes in working capital and other adjustments based on cash flow, as set forth in senior secured credit facilities. The excess cash flow payment that is
required to be paid in March 2009 is estimated at $1581 million and is included in the current portion of long-term debt. The senior
secured credit facilities contain covenants that restrict, among other things, the Companys ability to create liens, incur indebtedness and guarantees, make certain investments or acquisitions, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, pay
dividends, repurchase or redeem capital stock and subordinated indebtedness, change the nature of their business, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, make capital expenditures in excess of specified annual amounts, and make changes in
accounting policies or practices except as required by generally accepted accounting principles. The Company is also required to comply with two primary financial covenants: an interest coverage ratio for the preceding twelve months, which is tested
at the end of each fiscal quarter, and a consolidated leverage ratio, with which the Company must comply at all times. As of December31, 2008, the minimum interest coverage ratio and the maximum consolidated leverage ratio permitted under the
senior secured credit facilities were both 375 to 10. The Companys estimated interest coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio as of December31, 2008 were 471 to 10 and 321 to 10, respectively. Beginning with the quarter
ending September30, 2009, the minimum interest coverage ratio increases to 450 to 10 and the maximum consolidated leverage ratio decreases to 325 to 10. Beginning with the quarter ending 
74 Table of Contents CommScope,Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued In Thousands,
Unless Otherwise Noted 
September30, 2010, the minimum interest coverage ratio increases further to 500 to 10 and the maximum consolidated leverage ratio decreases further
to 250 to 10. Management believes the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the senior secured credit facilities as of December31, 2008. Failure to comply with these covenants would cause an event of default under the senior secured credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the outstanding balance of the senior secured term
loans becoming due and payable immediately, a material increase in the interest rate and further restrictions on the Companys operational and financial flexibility. As noted above, the Company amended its senior secured credit facilities on December24, 2008. Among other things, the amendment:  permits the Company to make, on or prior to March23, 2009, cash payments of up to $200 million in the aggregate to acquire, prepay, redeem, purchase or
convert its 1% convertible senior subordinated debentures;  provides that availability under the revolving credit facility will be permanently reduced by an amount equal to 100% of the amount, if any, by which the
Companys cash payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its 1% convertible senior subordinated debentures exceed $100 million in the aggregate;  provides that future optional prepayments of term loans during any fiscal year will reduce the excess cash flow prepayment requirement for such fiscal year
1by 75% of the amount of such optional prepayments, if the Companys consolidated leverage ratio as of the last day of such fiscal year is greater than or equal to 250 to 100, and 2by 100% of the amount of such optional
prepayments, if the Companys consolidated leverage ratio as of the last day of such fiscal year is less than 250 to 100; and  required the Company to make a prepayment of the term loans in the amount of $150 million on December26, 2008. Convertible Debentures 1% Convertible Senior Subordinated
Debentures In March 2004, the Company issued $250million aggregate principal amount of 1% convertible senior subordinated
debentures due March15, 2024. In connection with the issuance of the debentures, the Company incurred costs of approximately $69million, which were capitalized as other assets and are being amortized over a period of five years,
representing the period until the debenture holders may first require the Company to repurchase the debentures. The Company may redeem
some or all of these debentures at any time on or after March20, 2009 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures, plus accrued interest. Additionally, holders of the debentures may require the Company to
repurchase all or any portion of their debentures for cash on March20, 2009, March15, 2014 and March15, 2019 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of debentures to be repurchased, plus accrued interest. These debentures
are included in the current portion of long-term debt as of December31, 2008 because they are expected to be converted, redeemed or repurchased in the first quarter of 2009. See Note 18 for developments after December 31, 2008. 
75 Table of Contents CommScope,Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued In Thousands,
Unless Otherwise Noted 
During the year ended December31, 2008, the Company agreed with certain holders of the 1%
convertible senior subordinated debentures to increase the conversion rate as an inducement for them to convert their debentures to common stock. Accordingly, $5048 million of the debentures were converted into 2,394,938 shares of common stock
2,320,919 related to the original conversion ratio and 74,019 related to the inducement. As a result of the inducement, the Company recorded a $28 million pretax charge in other expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. These debentures are convertible into shares of CommScope common stock in the following circumstances: 1if the closing price of CommScope common
stock exceeds 120% of the conversion price then in effect for at least twenty trading days in the thirty consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, which condition was met for the
quarter ended December31, 2008 but was not met as of January1, 2009; 2subject to certain exceptions, during the five business days after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal
amount of the debentures for each day of such period was less than 98% of the product of the closing sale price of CommScope common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of $1,000 principal amount of the debentures; 3if the
debentures have been called for redemption; or 4upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions. As of December31,
2008, the conversion rate of these debentures was 45977 shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures, representing a conversion price of $2175 per share. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment, without duplication, upon the occurrence of
any of the following events, as more fully explained in the indenture governing the debentures: 1payment or issuance of common stock as a dividend or distribution on the Companys common stock; 2the issuance to all holders of
common stock of rights, warrants or options to purchase the Companys common stock for a period expiring within 45days of the record date for such distribution at a price less than the average of the closing sale prices for the 10 trading
days preceding the declaration date for such distribution; 3subdivisions, splits or combinations of the Companys common stock; 4distributions by the Company to all holders of the Companys common stock of shares of the
Companys capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, property or assets, including rights, warrants, options and other securities but excluding dividends or distributions covered by clauses1 or 2above or any dividend or
distribution paid exclusively in cash; provided that in the event that the Company distributes capital stock of, or similar equity interests in, a subsidiary or other business unit of the Company, then the conversion rate will be adjusted based on
the market value of the securities so distributed relative to the market value of the Companys common stock, in each case based on the average closing sales prices of those securities where such closing prices are available for the 10
trading days commencing on and including the fifth trading day after the date on which ex-dividend trading commences for such distribution on the New York Stock Exchange or such other principal national or regional exchange or market on
which the securities are then listed or quoted or in the absence of such a quotation, a closing sale price determined by the Company on a basis it considers appropriate; 5the payment of cash as a dividend or distribution on the
Companys common stock, excluding any dividend or distribution in connection with the Companys liquidation, dissolution or winding up; or 6the Company or any of its subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or
exchange offer for the Companys common stock to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of the Companys common stock exceeds the closing sale price per share of the Companys
common stock on the trading day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer. To the extent that any future shareholder rights plan adopted by the Company is in effect upon conversion of the debentures into common stock, holders of the debentures will receive, in addition to the common stock, the rights under the
rights plan unless the rights have separated from the common stock at the time of conversion, in which case the conversion rate will be adjusted as if the Company distributed to all holders of its common stock, 
76 Table of Contents CommScope,Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued In Thousands,
Unless Otherwise Noted 
shares of its capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, property or assets as described in clause4 above, subject to readjustment in the event of the
expiration, termination or redemption of such rights. In the event of 1any reclassification of the Companys common stock;
2a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange involving the Company; or 3a sale or conveyance to another person or entity of all or substantially all of the Companys property and assets, in which holders of the
Companys common stock would be entitled to receive stock, other securities, other property, assets or cash for their common stock, holders of the debentures will, upon conversion, be entitled to receive the same type of consideration that they
would have been entitled to receive if they had converted the debentures into the Companys common stock immediately prior to any of these events. The Company may, from time to time, increase the conversion rate if the Companys Board of Directors has made a determination that this increase would be in the Companys best interests. In addition, the
Company may increase the conversion rate if the Companys Board of Directors deems it advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of common stock resulting from any stock or rights distribution. 325% Convertible Senior Subordinated Debentures In
connection with the acquisition of Andrew, the Company assumed the outstanding balance of Andrews 325% convertible debentures. As a result of the acquisition, the debentures became convertible into merger consideration of $98615 of cash and
2304159 shares of the Companys common stock for each $1,000 in face value of the debentures. The $2105million outstanding face value of the debentures was recorded as $2313million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
December31, 2007, reflecting the fair value of the merger consideration. During the year ended December31, 2008, holders of
the 325% convertible senior subordinated debentures chose either to convert their debentures into the contractual merger consideration or to receive payment of principal plus accrued interest. As a result, $2076 million of cash was paid and
484,903 shares of the Companys common stock were issued. Other Matters Several of the Companys foreign subsidiaries maintain credit agreements. The total availability under these foreign credit agreements was
approximately $53 million, none of which was outstanding as of December31, 2008. The following table summarizes scheduled maturities
of long-term debt in millions.  2009

The weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings, including amortization of
associated loan fees, under the above debt instruments was 545% and 623% at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 9.DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES In December 2007, the Company entered into an interest rate
swap agreement to hedge against the variability of forecasted interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on a portion of the term loans issued under the senior secured credit facilities. Through this swap, the Company fixed the
following notional 
77 Table of Contents CommScope,Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued In Thousands,
Unless Otherwise Noted 
amounts at 41275%: $15billion from December27, 2007 through December31, 2008; $13billion during 2009; $10billion during
2010; and $400million during 2011. The interest rate swap agreement was designated as a cash flow hedge at inception and such designation was substantially effective at December31, 2008 and is expected to continue to be effective for the
duration of the swap agreement. During the year ended December31, 2008, interest expense of $13 million was recognized as a result of hedge ineffectiveness related to the interest rate swap. The fair value of the interest rate swap, reflected
in other noncurrent liabilities, was $706 million and $45 million as of December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. During the year
ended December31, 2008, the Company paid approximately $50 million and amended its cross currency swap to reduce the notional amount from $14 million to $7 million. This payment is included as an investing use of cash on the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows. Prior to this amendment, a portion of the swap was designated and documented as a hedge of the Companys net investment in its Belgian subsidiary to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by changes
in euro exchange rates. Subsequent to the amendment, the swap is designated as a hedge against fluctuations in the fair value of certain of the Companys euro-denominated assets. Pretax gains losses of $03 million, $07 million and
$03million on the portion designated as a fair value hedge are reflected in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The designations of the hedging
instrument were effective as of December31, 2008 and 2007, and are expected to continue to be effective for the duration of the agreement, resulting in no anticipated hedge ineffectiveness. The fair value of the cross currency swap was
$39million and $87million as of December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The cross currency swap matures in December 2009 and was included in other accrued liabilities at December31, 2008 and other noncurrent liabilities at
December31, 2007. There were no reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to earnings related to
derivative and hedging activities during the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Activity in the accumulated net loss on derivative instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the years ended
December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 consisted of the following:  2008 2007 2006 Accumulated net loss on derivative instruments, beginning of year 8,849 5,201 4,274 Loss on cross currency swap designated as a net fair value hedge, net of taxes 486 807 927 Loss on interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge, net of taxes 40,802 2,841 Accumulated net loss on derivative instruments, end of year 50,137 8,849 5,201 10.FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS As of January1, 2008, the Company implemented SFAS No157, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value as
required by other accounting pronouncements and expands disclosure requirements. In February2008, the FASB issued FSP No.FAS 157-2, which delays the effective date of SFAS No157 as it applies to non-financial assets and
liabilities that are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring at least annual basis. As a result of the delay, SFAS No157 will be applied to the Companys non-financial assets and liabilities as of January1, 2009.
78 Table of Contents CommScope,Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued In Thousands,
Unless Otherwise Noted 
SFAS No157 establishes a three-tier hierarchy for evaluating fair values based on the inputs
utilized to measure the fair values as follows:  Level1 Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets Level2 Inputs other than quoted market prices in active markets that are observable, either directly or indirectly; and
Level3 Inputs for which there is little or no observable market data, which requires the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
The Companys financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, trade
receivables, trade payables, debt instruments, a cross currency swap contract and an interest rate swap agreement see Note9. For cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and trade payables, the carrying amounts of these financial
instruments as of December31, 2008 and 2007 were considered representative of their fair values due to their short terms to maturity. The fair values of the Companys seven-year senior secured term loan and 1% convertible debentures see
Note8 were based on quoted market prices. The fair value of the Companys six-year senior secured term loan, which is not quoted in an active market, was based on the quoted market price of the seven-year term loan. The fair value of the
325% convertible debentures assumed in the Andrew acquisition was based on the value of merger consideration those noteholders were entitled to receive see Note8. The fair value of the Companys cross currency swap contract was based
on the net present value of the difference between the expected future U.S. dollar cash flows and the expected future euro cash flows. The fair value of the Companys interest rate swap agreement was based on the net present value of the
difference between the expected future fixed rate interest payments and variable rate interest payments. The fair value of the auction rate securities classified as other noncurrent assets was based on a broker quote. The carrying amounts, estimated fair values and SFAS No157 input levels of the Companys senior secured term loans, convertible debentures,
cross currency swap, interest rate swap, and auction rate securities as of December31, 2008 and 2007, are as follows:  2008

The fair value estimates presented above are based on pertinent information available to
management as of December31, 2008 and 2007. Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect these fair value estimates, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial
statements since those dates, and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented. The provisions of
SFAS No159 became effective for the Company as of January1, 2008. This standard gives companies the irrevocable option to carry most financial assets or liabilities at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. The
Company did not elect to carry any of its financial assets or liabilities at fair value under the provisions of SFAS No159.

11.EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Defined Contribution Plans The Company sponsors
defined contribution retirement savings plans that allow employees of certain subsidiaries to contribute a portion of their compensation on a pretax and/or after-tax basis in accordance with guidelines established by the plans and the Internal
Revenue Service. The Company matches a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits. The Company contributed $147million in 2008, $107million in 2007 and $102million in 2006 to these retirement savings plans.
The Company also maintains a noncontributory unfunded defined contribution pension plan the Restated SERP for certain active and retired
key executives. The Company is not required to make any payments until the participant is eligible to receive retirement benefits. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recognized pretax costs of $18million, $15million and
$12million, respectively, representing additional accrued benefits and interest credited under the Restated SERP. Benefit payments to retirees were $02million, $09million and $03million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The accrued liability, included in other noncurrent liabilities, was approximately $109million and $93million as of December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans The
Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans covering domestic represented employees and certain other domestic and foreign employees. Included in the defined benefit pension plans are both funded and unfunded plans and contributory and
noncontributory plans. The Company also sponsors postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans that provide benefits to certain domestic represented employees and certain full-time employees who retire from the Company. The health care
plans contain various cost-sharing features such as participant contributions, deductibles, coinsurance and caps, with Medicare as the primary provider of health care benefits for eligible retirees. The accounting for the health care plans
anticipates future cost-sharing changes to the written plan that are consistent with the Companys expressed intent to maintain a consistent level of cost sharing with retirees. The Company recognizes the cost of providing and maintaining
postretirement benefits during employees expected active service periods.

The Company considered the available yields on high-quality fixed-income investments with
maturities corresponding to the Companys expected benefit obligations to determine the discount rates at each measurement date. A
one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have had the following effects as of and for the year ended December31, 2008 in millions:  1-Percentage-PointIncrease
1-Percentage-PointDecrease Effect on total of service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost 16 13 Effect on postretirement benefit obligation 154 130
Plan Assets In developing the expected rate of return on plan assets, the Company considered the expected long-term rate of return of individual asset classes. Expected return on plan assets is based on the market related value
of the assets. Substantially all of the pension assets and certain of the other postretirement assets are managed by an independent investment advisor with an objective of maximizing return, subject to assuming a prudent level of risk. The majority
of such assets are currently invested with a target allocation of 70% equity securities and 30% fixed income instruments. The
Companys weighted-average asset allocations at December31, 2008 and 2007, by asset category, are as follows:  Pension Benefits OtherPostretirementBenefits 2008 2007 2008 2007 Asset category Equity securities

associated with federal net operating loss carryforwards, all of which were acquired in connection with the Companys acquisition of Andrew. These net operating loss carryforwards will expire between 2018 and 2028. Deferred tax assets as of
December31, 2008 also include $37 million of tax benefits associated with federal capital loss carryforwards which will expire in 2013. A full valuation allowance of $37 million has been established against this deferred tax asset because
available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the Company will not generate capital gains necessary to realize these benefits prior to expiration. During 2008, the Company realized $211million of foreign tax credit carryforwards. The deferred tax asset for federal tax credit carryforwards as of December31, 2008 includes foreign tax credit
carryforwards of 
86 Table of Contents CommScope,Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued In Thousands,
Unless Otherwise Noted 
$610million, which will expire between 2009 and 2018, research tax credit carryforwards of $260million, which will expire between 2009 and
2026, and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $17million with no expiration. A valuation allowance of $05million has been established against the deferred tax asset for research tax credit carryforwards because the
available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize a portion of these tax credit carryforwards prior to expiration. The deferred tax asset for state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards as of December31, 2008 includes tax benefits net of federal tax impact of $208million associated with state net operating
loss carryforwards, which begin to expire in 2009, and tax benefits net of federal tax impact of $33million associated with state tax credit carryforwards, which will expire between 2011 and 2028. A valuation allowance of $235million
has been established against this deferred tax asset because the available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize a portion of these net operating loss carryforwards prior to expiration. Deferred tax assets as of December31, 2008 include $461 million of tax benefits associated with foreign net operating loss carryforwards. These
net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2009 and some are subject to local restrictions limiting their utilization. Valuation allowances related to these foreign net operating loss carryforwards and certain other foreign deferred tax
assets of $446million as of December31, 2008 have been established because the available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize a portion of these net operating loss carryforwards and
deferred tax assets prior to expiration. In addition to the valuation allowances detailed above, the Company has also established a
valuation allowance of $32million against its deferred tax asset for certain transaction costs which the available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize these deferred tax benefits. 
The Company adopted the provisions of FIN48 as of January1, 2007, resulting in a $42million increase in the liability for
unrecognized tax benefits with an offsetting reduction to opening retained earnings. In addition, the Company reduced a long-term deferred tax asset by $40million with an offsetting reduction to opening retained earning of $19million
and an increase of $21million to long-lived assets as a purchase accounting adjustment related to the 2004 acquisition of ConnectivitySolutions. The activity within the liability for unrecognized tax benefits under FIN48 during
2008 and 2007 was as follows:  YearEndedDecember31 2008 2007 Balance at beginning of year 61,254 11,350 Increases related to prior periods 1,570 3,061 Decreases related to prior periods 2,733 310 Increases related to current periods 2,110 1,637 Decreases related to settlement with taxing authorities 4,911 2,249 Decreases related to lapse in statute of limitations 2,305 58 Increase related to Andrew acquisition 9,731 47,823 Balance at end of year 64,716 61,254 The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax
expense. As of December31, 2008, the Company had accrued approximately $79million for the payment of interest and penalties of which $16million and $14 million was accrued through the income tax provision during the years ended
December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In connection with the regular examination of the Companys federal, state and foreign
income tax returns for 2003 through 2006, the Company agreed to certain settlement positions with the IRS and various state and foreign tax authorities that reduced the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits by $49 million during 2008.
87 Table of Contents CommScope,Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued In Thousands,
Unless Otherwise Noted 
The Companys liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $647 million includes $499 million
that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate in future periods. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $30 million to $50 million in the
next twelve months as a result of the completion and settlement of audits in various jurisdictions. The tax issues include non-U.S. transfer pricing adjustments and state taxes. In the opinion of management, the Company has adequate reserves with
respect to these issues. As of December31, 2008, a deferred tax liability in the amount of $441 million had been established to
reflect the U.S. tax and state tax cost associated with the planned repatriation of that portion of the Companys undistributed foreign earnings that are not considered to be permanently reinvested in foreign operations. The cumulative amount
of undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries for which no U.S. income taxes have been provided was $5890million as of December31, 2008 as these earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Although
the Company does not currently intend to repatriate these earnings from foreign subsidiaries, foreign tax credits and other tax planning techniques may be available to reduce the resulting U.S. tax cost in the event of such repatriation.

issuance, of which no more than 15million shares may be full value awards stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance awards, as defined. Awards under the 2006 Plan may include stock, stock options, restricted stock,
restricted stock units, performance units, performance share units, performance-based restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and dividend equivalent rights for employees and non-employee directors of the Company. Approval of the 2006 Plan
canceled all shares authorized but not issued under the Amended and Restated CommScope,Inc. 1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan the 1997 Plan. Awards granted prior to May5, 2006 remain subject to the provisions of the 1997 Plan. As of
December31, 2008, approximately 09million shares were available for future grants under the 2006 Plan, of which 05million may be full value awards. In connection with the acquisition of Andrew, the Company filed a Registration Statement on FormS-8 to register approximately 19million shares of CommScope common stock to be issued under plans previously
authorized by Andrew shareholders the Andrew Plans. Of the approximately 19million shares registered, no more than approximately 07million may be full value awards. As of December31, 2008, approximately 09million shares
were available for future grants under the Andrew Plans, of which 05million may be full value awards. As of December31, 2008 266million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested awards are expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 18years. There were no significant capitalized equity-based compensation costs
at December31, 2008.

Stock Options Stock options are awards that allow the recipient to purchase shares of the Companys common stock at a fixed price. Stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to or greater than the Companys
stock price at the date of grant. These awards generally vest one-third per year over the three years following the grant date and have a contractual term of ten years.

2,566 2601 The weighted average remaining contractual life of exercisable options at December31, 2008
was 41years. The Company uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. Key input assumptions used
in the model to estimate the fair value of stock options include the grant price of the award, the expected option term, volatility of the Companys stock, the risk-free rate and the Companys projected dividend yield. The Company believes
that the valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in estimating the fair values of CommScope stock options. Estimates of fair value

are not intended to predict actual future events or the value that will ultimately be realized by employees who receive equity awards, and subsequent events
are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by the Company. The following table presents the weighted average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock option awards granted for the years ended

All stock options granted in 2007 were part of the consideration for the Andrew acquisition. On August10, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors amended certain stock option agreements with employees to
accelerate the vesting of certain outstanding unvested stock options. Unvested options to purchase 21million shares with an average exercise price of $1754 per share became exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration. The intrinsic
value of the stock options on the acceleration date was $26million. The Company recognized no compensation expense associated with these options during the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 as a result of the accelerated
vesting in 2005. Had these options not been accelerated, the Company would have recognized an additional $29million and $65million in pretax compensation expense for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Performance Share Units Performance
Share Units issued under the 2006 Plan and the Andrew plans or Performance Units issued under the 1997 Plan collectively PSUs are stock awards in which the number of shares ultimately received by the employee depends on Company performance against
specified targets. Such awards vest and shares are issued after three years if the performance targets are met. The fair value of each PSU is determined on the date of grant, based on the Companys stock price and the likelihood that
performance targets will be achieved. Over the performance period, the number of shares of stock that will be issued is adjusted upward or downward based upon the probable achievement of performance targets. The ultimate number of shares issued and
the related compensation cost recognized will be based on a comparison of the final performance metrics to the targets specified in the grants. For PSUs granted during 2008, the level of performance achieved was 71%, resulting in a decline in the
number of PSUs outstanding as of December31, 2008. The following table summarizes the PSU activity for the year ended

regulations governing the use, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous materials. Compliance with current laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a materially adverse effect on the Companys financial condition
or results of operations. Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a patent infringement lawsuit with TruePosition, Inc. related to Andrews sale of certain mobile location products. In September of 2007, a jury ruled in favor of TruePosition and awarded $453 million in
damages. Management believed the verdict was in error and sought to have it reversed. After the submission of motions on the
Companys attempts to set aside the verdict and TruePositions request for a permanent injunction and an enhancement of the damages awarded, up to trebling the amount, the trial court reduced the compensatory judgment amount from $453
million to $186 million plus interest, and while denying the request for trebling, enhanced the reduced damage amount by 25%, bringing the total judgment to $2325 million. The court also granted TruePositions motion for a permanent
injunction related to the products at issue and indicated that it will enter such an injunction. The parties are currently engaged in discovery related to the scope of the injunction, as well as an accounting to determine what, if any, additional
amounts Andrew may be liable for related to one additional phase of the customer project at issue. CommScope disagrees with the underlying
verdict, the enhancement of damages and the entry of an injunction and continues to believe that the products at issue do not infringe TruePositions patent. CommScope expects to appeal the remaining portion of the underlying judgment, as well
as the injunction which the court indicated it will enter. As a result of the trial court ruling in the case, the Companys estimate
of the probable loss was reduced from $453 million to $284 million including interest. The ultimate resolution of the TruePosition litigation may be materially different than the current estimate, which does not include legal fees we may incur
in appeals or other proceedings. The litigation with TruePosition may result in the loss of future revenue opportunities, including opportunities to manufacture and sell products using uplink time difference of arrival U-TDOA technology; however,
the Company is not currently able to assess the likelihood or magnitude of such potential lost opportunities. In March 2008, TruePosition
Inc. served Andrew with a complaint in a lawsuit filed in the Superior Court, New Castle County in Delaware. The suit alleges that Andrew breached certain patent license royalty obligations to TruePosition under a 2004 settlement agreement related
to a prior lawsuit between the parties and alleges that Andrew owes TruePosition approximately $30 million. The Company believes it has valid defenses and will vigorously defend itself in this action.

CommScope is either a plaintiff or a defendant in other pending legal matters in the normal course of
business. Management believes none of these other legal matters, other than that discussed above, will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition upon their final disposition. 16.INDUSTRY SEGMENTS, MAJOR CUSTOMERS, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION Segment Information As a result of the acquisition
of Andrew, management reorganized its internal reporting structure, which consequently affects the Companys reportable segments. The Companys four reportable segments, which align with the manner in which the business is managed, are as
follows: Antenna, Cable and Cabinets Group ACCG; Enterprise; Broadband; and Wireless Network Solutions WNS. The ACCG segment includes
product offerings of primarily passive transmission devices for the wireless infrastructure market including base station antennas, coaxial cable and connectors and microwave antennas as well as secure environmental enclosures for electronic devices
and equipment used by wireline and wireless providers. The ACCG segment is largely composed of product lines that were part of legacy Andrew. The Enterprise segment consists mainly of structured cabling systems for business enterprise applications and connectivity solutions for wired and wireless networks within organizations. The segment also includes coaxial cable for various
video and data applications that are not related to cable television. The Broadband segment consists mainly of coaxial cable, fiber optic
cable and conduit for cable television system operators. These products support multi-channel video, voice and high-speed data services for residential and commercial customers using hybrid fiber coaxial architecture. The WNS segment consists of base station subsystems and core network products such as power amplifiers, filters, location-based systems, network
optimization analysis systems and products and solutions that extend and enhance the coverage of wireless networks, such as RF repeaters and distributed antenna systems. Base station subsystems and RF products cover all of the major wireless
standards and frequency bands and are sold individually or as part of integrated systems. The WNS segment is entirely composed of product lines that were part of legacy Andrew.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Our disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have reviewed the
effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form10-K and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December31, 2008 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting The management of CommScope is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule13a-15f or 15d-15f promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:  Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and  Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a
material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. CommScope management assessed the effectiveness of CommScopes internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008. In making this assessment, CommScopes management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management concludes that, as of December31, 2008, CommScopes
internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the COSO internal control criteria. CommScopes independent
registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of CommScopes internal control over financial reporting. February26, 2009

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders of CommScope, Inc. We have audited CommScope, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. CommScope, Incs management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, CommScope, Inc. maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited,
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheet of CommScope, Inc. as of December31, 2008 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity and comprehensive loss and cash flows for the year ended December31, 2008 and our report dated February26, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst Young LLP Charlotte,
