ENGlobal Corporation
Houston, Texas
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ENGlobal
Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and
cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31,
2009. We have also audited the schedule listed in the accompanying Item 8. These
consolidated financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements and schedule are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and
schedule, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements and schedule. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ENGlobal Corporation
and subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three year period
ended December 31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, the schedule presents fairly, in all material respects,
the information set forth, therein in relation to the financial statements taken
as a whole.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the Company internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established
in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 8, 2010,

54 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
ENGlobal Corporation
We have audited ENGlobal Corporation internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal
Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. ENGlobal Corporation
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the company internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, ENGlobal Corporation maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in
Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of
ENGlobal Corporation as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, of ENGlobal and
our report dated March 8, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ Hein & Associates LLP,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Organization and Operations
- ENGlobal Corporation is a Nevada corporation formed in 1994. Unless the context
requires otherwise, references to we, us, our, the Company or ENGlobal
are intended to mean the consolidated business and operations of ENGlobal
Corporation.
Our business operations consist of providing engineering and other professional
project services related to design, fabrication, procurement, maintenance,
environmental and other governmental compliance and construction management,
primarily with respect to energy sector infrastructure facilities throughout the
United States and Canada. Please see Note 17-Segment Information for a
description of our segments and segment operations.
Basis of Presentation
- The accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes present our
consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
results of our operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders' equity for
the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. They are prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Certain amounts for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to
the current presentation. In preparing financial statements, management makes
informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing
basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to
percentage-of-completion contracts in progress, litigation, income taxes,
impairment of long-lived assets and fair values. Changes in facts and
circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
NOTE 2 -ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
On July 1, 2009, the FASB issued the authoritative version of the Accounting
Standards Codification TM Codification or ASC as the single source of
authoritative nongovernmental U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
U.S. GAAP. The Codification is effective for interim and annual periods ended
after September 15, 2009 and all previous level a-d U.S. GAAP standards
issued by a standard setter are superseded. The Company has adopted the
provisions of the Codification with its reporting period ended September 30,
2009. Adoption of the new guidance did not materially impact the Company
financial statements.
Cash and cash equivalents
- Cash and cash equivalents include all cash on hand, demand deposits, and
investments with original maturities of three months or less. We consider cash
equivalents to include short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant
risk of changes in value.
The company utilizes a cash management system whereby bank accounts are swept
daily to reduce outstanding balances on the Company line of credit. Major
operating bank accounts are automatically replenished daily to meet
check-clearing requirements. Outstanding checks are recorded as a reduction of
cash when they are issued. Our checks that have not yet been paid by banks at a
reporting date are reclassified to accounts payable in the financial statements.
Amounts reclassified to accounts payable for outstanding checks were $13
million and $30 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 respectively.
Consolidation Policy
- Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our
majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest after the
elimination of all material inter-company accounts and transactions. Currently,
all of our subsidiaries are wholly-owned. We also consolidate other entities and
ventures in which we possess a controlling interest. We evaluate our financial
interests in business enterprises to determine if they represent variable
60            ENGLOBAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary. If such criteria are
met, we consolidate the financial statements of such businesses with those of
our own. We do not currently hold such interests.
While we do not currently own any significant equity interests in unconsolidated
affiliates and do not frequently conduct our business through such entities, it
is our policy to follow the equity method of accounting if our ownership
interest is between 20% and 50% and we exercise significant influence over the
operating and financial policies of an entity. Our proportionate share of
profits and losses from transactions with equity method unconsolidated
affiliates is eliminated in consolidation to the extent such amounts are
material and remain on our equity method investees' balance sheet in inventory
or similar accounts.
If our ownership interest in an investee does not provide us with either control
or significant influence over the investee, we account for the investment using
the cost method.
Comprehensive Income
- Comprehensive income includes net income and other comprehensive income.
Currently our other comprehensive income is comprised of unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses.
Accumulated other comprehensive income is as follows                        2009    2008    2007

Comprehensive income loss        $ 1,137  $ 18,143  $ 12,459
Concentration of Credit Risk
- Financial instruments which potentially subject ENGlobal to concentrations of
credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts and notes receivable. Although
our services are provided largely to the energy sector, management believes the
risk due to this concentration is limited because a significant portion of our
services are provided under contracts with major integrated oil and gas
companies and other industry leaders. To the extent that the Company has entered
into contracts with smaller customers, it has incurred an increased credit risk.
We extend credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of
business. We have established various procedures to manage our credit exposure,
including initial credit approvals, credit limits and terms, letters of credit,
and occasionally through rights of offset. We also use prepayments and
guarantees to limit credit risk to ensure that our established credit criteria
are met. Our most significant exposure to credit risks relates to situations
under which we provide services early in the life of a project that is dependent
on financing. Certain of these development projects are susceptible to
unforeseen delays and other issues that expose us to reduced margins and
possible losses. Risks increase in times of general economic crisis and under
conditions that threaten project feasibility.
Estimated losses on accounts receivable are provided through an allowance for
doubtful accounts. In evaluating the level of established reserves, we make
judgments regarding each party ability to make required payments, economic
events and other factors. As the financial condition of any party changes,
circumstances develop or additional information becomes available, adjustments
to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required.
Earnings per share
- The Company basic earnings per share EPS amounts have been computed based on
the average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted
EPS amounts include the effect of our outstanding stock options, restricted
stock awards and restricted stock units under the treasury stock method, if
including such potential shares of common stock is dilutive. See Note 5.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Debt Issue Costs
- Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of long-term debt are capitalized
and charged to interest expense over the term of the related debt on a
straight-line basis, which approximates the interest method.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
- 
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the
fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company assesses
the carrying amount of goodwill by testing the goodwill for impairment annually.
We perform a test for impairment as of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year
and in any period in which impairment indicators arise. The impairment test
requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to business
units referred to as reporting units. The fair value of each reporting unit is
determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the fair
value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, including goodwill,
then the goodwill is written down to the implied fair value of the goodwill
through a charge to expense. Reporting units for the purpose of goodwill
impairment calculations are components one level below our operating segments.
Changes in goodwill may result from, among other things, changes in deferred
income tax liabilities related to previous acquisitions, impairments, future
acquisitions or future divestitures.
Intangible assets are comprised primarily of non-compete covenants and customer
relationships acquired through acquisitions and are amortized using the
straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of the intangible
assets.
We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be
recoverable. This review consists of comparing the carrying value of the asset
with the asset expected future undiscounted cash flows. Estimates of expected
future cash flows represent management best estimate based on reasonable and
supportable assumptions. If such a review should indicate that the carrying
amount of intangible assets is not recoverable, we reduce the carrying amount of
such assets to fair value.
Property and Equipment
- Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated service lives of our asset
groups are as follows                              Range of
Asset Group                  Years
Machinery and equipment             7-10
Furniture and fixtures             5-7
Computing equipment and automobiles       3-5
Software                    3-5
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the related lease. See
Note 7 for details related to property and equipment and related depreciation.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Upon
disposition or retirement of property and equipment, any gain or loss is charged
to operations.
The Company reviews property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of
an asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount.
Pre-Contract Costs
- The Company expenses pre-contract costs as they are incurred. Pre-contract
costs, otherwise called Proposal costs, are recorded in accordance with ASC
605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type Contracts, which requires that
costs that are incurred for a specific anticipated contract and that will result
62            ENGLOBAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS in no future benefits unless the contract is obtained should not be included in
contract costs or inventory before the receipt of the contract. Costs related to
anticipated contracts are charged to expenses as incurred because their recovery
is not considered probable and they are not reinstated by a credit to income on
the subsequent receipt of the contract.
Income Taxes
- The Company accounts for deferred income taxes in accordance with the asset and
liability method, whereby deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax
consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates
applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of its assets and liabilities. The
provision for income taxes represents the current taxes payable or refundable
for the period plus or minus the tax effect of the net change in the deferred
tax assets and liabilities during the period. Valuation allowances are provided
for deferred tax assets when their recovery is doubtful.
The Company files income tax returns in federal, state and foreign jurisdictions
as more fully described in Note 15. It has not taken an uncertain tax position
as defined by authoritative accounting literature and does not expect to take
such a position on a tax return not yet filed.
Revenue Recognition
- Our revenue is comprised of engineering, construction management and procurement
service fees and sales of control systems that we design and fabricate. In
general, we recognize revenues when all of the following criteria are met: 1
persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists, if applicable, 2
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, 3 the price is fixed or
determinable, and 4 collection is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes
service revenue as the services are performed. The majority of the Company
engineering services are provided under cost-plus contracts. A majority of sales
of fabricated systems are under fixed-price contracts that may also include a
service element covered under that contract price.
We also sometimes serve as purchasing agent by procuring subcontractors,
materials and equipment on behalf of a client and pass the cost on to the client
with no mark-up or profit. In accordance with ASC 605-35, revenues and costs for
these types of pass-through transactions are reported net. During 2009 and
2008, we had no pass-through transactions but in 2007, pass-through transactions
totaled $05 million.
Profits and losses on our fixed-price contracts are recognized on the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting, measured by the
percentage-of-contract cost incurred to date relative to estimated total
contract cost. Contract costs used for estimating percentage-of-completion
factors include professional compensation and related benefits, materials,
subcontractor services and other direct cost of projects. Freight charges and
inspection costs are charged directly to the projects to which they relate.
Costs recognized for labor include all actual employee compensation plus a
burden factor to cover estimated variable labor expenses. These variable labor
expenses consist of payroll taxes, self-insured medical plan expenses, workers
compensation insurance, general liability insurance, and paid time off. These
estimated amounts are adjusted to actual costs incurred at the end of each
quarter.
Under the percentage-of-completion method, revenue recognition is dependent upon
the accuracy of a variety of estimates, including the progress of engineering
and design efforts, material installation, labor productivity, cost estimates
and others. These estimates are based on various professional judgments and are
difficult to accurately determine until projects are significantly underway. Due
to uncertainties inherent to the estimation process, it is possible that actual
percentage-of-completion may vary materially from our estimates. Estimating
errors may cause errors in revenue recognition on uncompleted contracts and may
even result in losses on the contracts. Anticipated losses on uncompleted
contracts are charged to operations as soon as such losses can be estimated.
Changes in job performance, job conditions, estimated profitability and final
contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are
recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.
Occasionally, it is appropriate for us to combine or segment contracts in order
to meet requirements of ASC 605-35. Contracts are combined in those limited
circumstances when they are negotiated as a package in the same economic
63            ENGLOBAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS environment with an overall profit margin objective and constitute, in essence,
an agreement to do a single project. In such cases, we recognize revenue and
cost over the performance period of the combined contracts as if they were one.
Contracts may be segmented if the customer has the right to accept separate
elements of a contract and the total economic returns and risks of the separate
contract elements are similar to the economic returns and risks of the overall
contract. For segmented contracts, we recognize revenue as if they were separate
contracts over the performance periods of the individual elements or phases.
Software Development Costs
- ENGlobal capitalizes costs associated with software developed or acquired for
internal use when these criteria are met - the preliminary project stage is
completed, management authorizes funding for the project and the project is
deemed probable of completion. Capitalized costs include external costs of
materials and services incurred in obtaining and developing the software and
payroll and payroll related costs for employees in proportion to time devoted to
the project. Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at
which the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its
intended use. Software development costs are included in property and equipment
and are amortized on the straight-line basis over five years.
Stock-Based Compensation
- The Company accounts for stock-based compensation at fair value. The company
grants various types of stock-based awards including stock options and
non-vested equity shares restricted stock awards and units. The fair value of
stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Restricted stock awards and units are valued using the market price of ENGlobal
common stock on the grant date. The Company records compensation cost for
stock-based compensation awards over the requisite service period usually a
vesting period. Compensation expense is recognized net of estimated
forfeitures. As each award vests, adjustments are made to compensation cost for
any difference between estimated forfeitures and the actual forfeitures related
to the awards.

The following table lists the percentage of our consolidated sales by customer,

Alon USA         <1%   10%   <1 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
- 
Management reviews property and equipment for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may
not be recoverable. The carrying amount is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds
the undiscounted sum of the cash flows expected to result from the use and
eventual disposition of the asset. Estimates of expected future cash flows
represent management best estimate based on reasonable and supportable
assumptions. If the carrying amount is not recoverable, the impairment loss is
measured as the excess of the asset carrying value over its fair value.
Management assesses the fair value of long-lived assets using commonly accepted
techniques, and may use more than one method, including, but not limited to,
recent third party comparable sales, internally developed discounted cash flow
analysis and analysis from outside advisors.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
- 
Certain recently issued accounting standards that apply to our business are
discussed below in terms of their effect on the Company financial statements.
On May 28, 2009, the FASB issued FAS 165, Subsequent Events, now codified as ASC
855, Subsequent Events, which provides guidance on management assessment of
subsequent events. Historically, management had relied on U.S. auditing
64            ENGLOBAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS literature for guidance on assessing and disclosing subsequent events. ASC 855
represents the inclusion of guidance on subsequent events in the accounting
literature and is directed specifically to management, since management is
responsible for preparing an entity financial statements. ASC 855 clarifies
that management must evaluate, as of each reporting period, events or
transactions that occur after the balance sheet date through the date that the
financial statements are issued. ASC 855 is effective prospectively for interim
and annual financial periods ending after June 15, 2009. The Company has adopted
the provisions of ASC 855 effective with its reporting period ending June 30,
2009. The adoption of ASC 855 did not have a material impact on the Company
financial condition or results of operations. The Company has evaluated
subsequent events up through the date of the filing of this report with the SEC.
In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS 141R, Business Combinations, now
codified as ASC 805, Business Combinations. ASC 805 significantly changes the
accounting for business combinations. Under ASC 805, an acquiring entity is
required to recognize, with limited exceptions, all the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value. ASC 805
changes the accounting treatment for certain specific acquisition related items
including, among other items: 1 expensing acquisition related costs as
incurred, 2 valuing non-controlling interests at fair value at the acquisition
date, and 3 expensing restructuring costs associated with an acquired
business. ASC 805 also includes a substantial number of new disclosure
requirements. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 805 on January 1, 2009.
The full impact to the Company, which could be material, will be dependent upon
any individual transactions consummated.
NOTE 3 - ACQUISITIONS
PCI Management and Consulting Company
A subsidiary of the Company acquired the operations of PCI Management and
Consulting Company PCI, a private Illinois based power consulting business,
through an immaterial business combination which closed August 14, 2009.
Consideration approximated $1,050,000 in cash and $200,000 in the form of a
note. PCI provides engineering, consulting and project management services,
specializing in projects related to the generation, transmission and
distribution of energy. PCI services complement the services historically
provided by our Construction segment, and the Company anticipates that PCI
location in the Chicago, Illinois area will allow the Company to establish a
strong regional base from which to serve the power market. Results of operations
are included in the Construction segment beginning August 15, 2009.
The acquisition, which was structured as a taxable transaction that excluded all
monetary assets and liabilities and all contingencies of the acquired business,
was accounted for following the requirements of ASC 805. The Company recognized
customer relationships and non-compete covenants as intangible assets. The
intangible assets were recognized at their fair values on the acquisition date
of $353,000 and $177,000 respectively, and are being amortized over five years.
The fair values were determined using an income approach methodology that is
consistent with previous similar acquisitions.
The residual portion of consideration $702,000 was recognized as goodwill, all
of which is deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill represents management
estimate of the cost associated with acquiring PCI power consulting
reputation, technical expertise, workforce and the potential synergies with our
other energy infrastructure consulting businesses. Acquisition cost of $6,000
was incurred and expensed as general and administrative expenses during the nine
months ended September 30, 2009.
Advanced Control Engineering, LLC
On September 29, 2008, we acquired all of the business of Advanced Control
Engineering, LLC ACE for $4,484,000, including acquisition related costs.
Advanced Control provides control systems and related technical services for a
broad range of industries including the mid-stream oil and gas and refining
industry. We acquired ACE to complement the services of our existing Automation
Segment and to expand our technical intellectual talent base and geographical
and industry coverage. ACE is included in our consolidated results of operations
65            ENGLOBAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS from October 1, 2008. We accounted for this acquisition in accordance with ASC
805, Business Combinations. The purchase price was allocated to assets acquired
and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values of the respective assets
and liabilities at the time of closing. Amounts allocated to non-compete
covenants and customer relationships were recorded at their estimated fair
values of approximately $471,000 and $1,568,000, respectively, resulting in
approximately $1,017,000 of the purchase price being allocated to goodwill. The
allocation is summarized below.

reflect any cost savings or other synergies that might be anticipated or any
future acquisition-related expenses. The pro forma adjustments are based on
estimates and assumptions.
The pro forma information for 2008 and 2007 is a result of combining the income
statement of ENGlobal with the pre-acquisition results from January 1, 2008 and
2007 of ACE adjusted for 1 recording pro forma interest expense on debt
incurred to acquire ACE; 2 amortization expense for intangible assets
recognized in applying the purchase method of accounting; and 3 the related
income tax effects of these adjustments and recognition of income taxes not
previously recognized by ACE because of its status as a limited liability
company, based on applicable statutory tax rates. NOTE 4 - GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill
- The Company recognized goodwill of $702,000 associated with the acquisition of
PCI Management and Consulting Company during 2009 and $1,017,000 associated with
the acquisition of Advanced Control Engineering during 2008 as discussed in Note
3.

Our annual goodwill impairment analysis for the years ended December 31, 2009
and 2008 indicated that no goodwill impairments were required for any of our
reporting units for the period. Our methodologies for performing our goodwill
impairment analysis have not changed from the prior year. However, we did
incorporate changes relating to growth rate in response to current economic
condition, and the discount rate increased approximately 1% for the current year
analysis. Except for Automation, the fair value of all of our reporting units
substantially exceeded their carrying value. The fair value for Automation,
which has $18 million of goodwill recorded as of December 31, 2009, exceeded
carrying value by 7%. Deterioration in our expected operating results or
increases in our cost of capital could have a negative effect on fair value and
lead to an impairment in the future.
The results of our annual goodwill impairment analysis for the year ended
December 31, 2007 indicated impairment to goodwill recorded in our Automation
segment. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $432,000
during the fourth quarter of 2007. The impairment stemmed primarily from a
continuing decline in the reporting unit cash flows. The charge was a full
impairment of the goodwill recorded as a result of the merger between Industrial
Data Systems Corporation and Petrocon Engineering, Inc. in December 2001.
Intangible Assets
- The Company recognized $530,000 of intangible assets during 2009 in connection
with the acquisition of PCI Management and Consulting Company. The Company
recognized $2,039,000 of intangible assets during 2008 in connection with the
acquisition of Advanced Control Engineering. Our identifiable intangible assets
are comprised primarily of non-compete covenants and customer relationships
acquired through acquisitions. All are being amortized. The following table

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Subject to our reserve for uncollectible accounts, all amounts listed are
believed to be collectible within a year. The billed accounts receivable amount
includes $716,000 in claims subject to uncertainty concerning their
determination or ultimate realization due to bankruptcy issues. These claims are
fully accounted for in our reserve for uncollectible accounts. There are no
amounts unbilled representing claims or other similar items subject to
uncertainty concerning their determination or ultimate realization. In
estimating the allowance for uncollectible accounts, we consider the length of
time receivable balances have been outstanding, historical collection
experience, current economic conditions and customer specific information. When
we ultimately conclude that a receivable is uncollectible, the balance is
charged against the allowance for uncollectible accounts.
The components of long-term receivables as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 are as
follows                               2009    2008

Other notes and claims receivable            6,001     16
$ 14,621  $ 8,636
On August 31, 2007, SLE executed a Collateral Mortgage, a Collateral Note, and a
Promissory Note in the amount of up to $15 million, securing payment of the
amounts due. In connection with this Promissory Note, and as provided for under
Louisiana law, SLE executed another promissory note the Hand Note on or
about October 22, 2007. The Hand Note had a principal balance of approximately
$123 million, constituting all amounts then due.
As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a valuation
reserve and subsequent charge against Bad Debt expense in the amount of $32
million to reduce the book value of the Note Receivable. In the fourth quarter
of 2008, the Company increased the valuation reserve and subsequent charge
against Bad Debt expense in the amount of $559,000. As of December 31, 2008, the
Company performed its impairment analysis for the asset group classified as
long-term notes receivable, particularly Notes Receivable - South Louisiana
Ethanol, of $86 million.
In August 2009, SLE filed for Chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in New Orleans. Due to the ongoing discovery and analysis currently in process
on our SLE litigation, we cannot yet determine the actual proceeds that would be
generated for ENGlobal when the courts determine the status of each asset and
the relative lien priorities of SLE creditors, and then such assets are sold.
However, at this time, management believes that, given the Company lien
position as documented in public records, the value of the collateral will cover
the current balance sheet exposure. Any additional charge, or negative
determination by the courts, could have a negative impact on future earnings
estimated at 21 cents per share per million of un-recovered exposure as a
result of a non-cash charge to operations. However, at this time the Company
believes that the ultimate disposition of the SLE collateral will not materially
adversely affect our liquidity or overall financial position.
The Company continues to believe that, because of the potential liquidation
value of the Collateral and the Company favorable lien status, the Note
Receivable should be substantially collectible. Specifically, an appraisal in
December 2008 from the bridge lending bank appraiser indicates a fair market
value of $221 million, an orderly liquidation value of $149 million, and a
forced liquidation value of $117 million.
The Company has reclassified the notes receivable of $30 million related to the
Alon USA, LP litigation to a long-term notes receivable. From the facts
determinable at present, we believe all amounts are collectible. However, if the
Company is unsuccessful in collecting the entire amount due, based on the
current year tax rate, the future financial impact to EPS would be
approximately $006 per share.
70            ENGLOBAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company has reclassified the accounts receivable balance of $30 million
related to the Bigler, L.P. litigation and subsequent bankruptcy filing to a
long term claims receivable. The Company believes the lien position is favorable
and there is sufficient collateral to cover any amounts due to the Company.
However, the company continues to assess its lien priorities and other matters
related to the distribution of assets. A failure to collect a material portion
of this claim could have a material financial impact, but should not impact the
Company liquidity position as charge-backs would be non-cash in nature. If the
Company was unsuccessful in collecting the entire amount of the current balance
of $30 million, based on the current year tax rate, the future financial
impact to EPS would be approximately $006 per share. The Company plans to
closely monitor the bankruptcy claims and will continue to pursue all available
remedies to recover on its claims. At this time, the Company considers the claim
to be collectible. The Company has not recorded a reserve against the account
balance but has created a reserve to cover its anticipated legal expenses.
The components of other current liabilities as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 are
as follows                             2009     2008

NOTE 10 - LINE OF CREDIT AND DEBT
Effective December 29, 2009, the Company entered into a new credit agreement
with Wells Fargo Bank, which provides a twenty-eight month, $25 million senior
secured revolving credit facility Wells Fargo Credit Facility. The Wells
Fargo Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of the Company
subsidiaries, is secured by substantially all of the Company assets, and
positions Wells Fargo as senior to all other debt. The Wells Fargo Facility
replaced a $50 million senior revolving credit facility with Comerica Bank that
would have expired in August 2010. The outstanding balance on the Wells Fargo
71            ENGLOBAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Credit Facility as of December 31, 2009 was $60 million borrowed at a
fluctuating rate per the terms of the Wells Fargo Credit Facility. The remaining
borrowings available under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility as of December 31,
2009 were $184 million after consideration of loan covenant restrictions.
At the Company option, amounts borrowed under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility
will bear interest at either a fluctuating rate per annum two percent 2% above
the Daily One Month LIBOR Rate in effect from to time to time or a fixed rate
per annum determined by Wells Fargo to be two percent 2% above LIBOR in effect
on the first day of an applicable fixed rate term. The Wells Fargo Credit
Facility includes a commitment fee of 30 basis points for the unused portion of
the $25 million credit facility.
At any time any portion of the debt under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility bears
interest determined in relation to LIBOR for a Fixed Rate Term, it may be
continued by the Company at the end of the Fixed Rate Term applicable thereto so
that all or a portion thereof bears interest determined in relation to the Daily
One Month LIBOR Rate or to LIBOR for a new Fixed Rate Term designated by the
Company.
The Company Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain certain financial
covenants as of the end of each calendar quarter, including the following   o  Total Liabilities to Tangible Net Worth Ratio not greater than 225 to
100;
o  Asset Coverage Ratio not less than 200 to 100; and
o  Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio not less than 175 to 100 Total Liabilities is defined as the aggregate of current liabilities and
non-current liabilities. Tangible Net Worth is defined as the aggregate of
total stockholders' equity less any intangible assets and less any loans or
advances to, or investments in, any related entities or individuals. Asset
Coverage Ratio is defined as accounts receivable divided by revolver balance.
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is determined on a rolling four-quarter basis and
is defined as EBITDA minus cash taxes, divided by interest expense, plus the
current maturity of long term debt, where EBITDA is net income, plus interest
expense, plus income taxes, plus depreciation and amortization, plus stock
compensation expense.
The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility as of
December 31, 2009. During the previous quarterly reporting period our Total
Liabilities to Tangible Net Worth Ratio ranged from 107 to 061; our Asset
Coverage Ratio ranged from 376 to 845; and our Fixed Charge Ratio ranged from
847 to 291. During the twelve month period ended December 31, 2009, we
expended or committed approximately 92%, or $32 million, of the $35 million
fiscal year covenant limitation on capital expenditures. Our office expansion in
Beaumont and the relocation of our manufacturing facility in Houston account for
$11 million and $16 million respectively in leasehold and equipment costs. The
$05 million balance of our capital expenditures for the twelve month period has
been for normal operating requirements including office furniture, computers,
software and vehicles.
For the quarterly period ended December 31, 2009, our Total Liabilities to
Tangible Net Worth Ratio and Asset Coverage Ratio covenant levels improved over
their respective average ratios for the three previous quarterly periods. The
Company Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the quarterly period ended December
31, 2009 declined 53% from the average ratio of the three previous quarterly
periods.
The Wells Fargo Credit Facility also contains covenants that place certain
limitations on the Company including limits on capital expenditures, other
indebtedness, mergers, asset sales, investments, guarantees, restrictions on
dividends and certain distributions and pledges of assets. The Company was in
compliance with all covenants under the Wells Fargo Credit Facility as of
December 31, 2009.
Letters of Credit
- As of December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling
$611,000 primarily to cover self-insured deductibles under both our general
liability and our workers' compensation insurance policies.

NOTE 12 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
ENGlobal sponsors a 401k profit sharing plan for its employees. Until January
2009, the Company made matching contributions equal to 6666% of employee
contributions up to 6% of employee compensation for regular as distinguished
from project or contract employees. All other employees except our pipeline
inspectors were matched at 50% of employee contribution up to 6% of
compensation, as defined by the plan. The Company, at the direction of the Board
of Directors, may make other discretionary contributions. Our employees may
elect to make contributions pursuant to a salary reduction agreement upon
meeting age and length-of-service requirements. On January 1, 2009 due to the
current economic conditions, the Company elected to reduce its match on regular
employees to 50% and all other employees except our pipeline inspectors to
3333% of employee contributions up to 6% of employee compensation. On April 4,
2009, the Company elected to eliminate its match on all employees. The Company
made contributions of approximately $982,000, $3,049,000, and $2,147,000,
respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007.
NOTE 13 - STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS
The Company 1998 Incentive Plan Option Plan that provided for the issuance
of options to acquire up to 3,250,000 shares of common stock expired in June
2008. The Option Plan provided for grants of non-statutory options, incentive
stock options, restricted stock awards and stock appreciation rights. All stock
option grants were for a ten-year term. Stock options issued to executives and
management generally vest over a four-year period, one-fifth at grant date and
one-fifth at December 31 of each year until they are fully vested. Stock options
issued to directors under the Option Plan vested quarterly over a one-year
period. In 2008, options were granted to employees to acquire 140,000 shares. In
2007, no stock options were granted to employees. At the 2007 Annual Meeting of
Directors, grants of stock options were approved for 50,000 shares to each
non-employee director. All stock options granted had a strike price equal to the
market value of the Company stock on the date of the grant by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors.
In June 2009, the Company stockholders approved a new 2009 Equity Incentive
Plan Equity Plan that provides for the issuance of up to 480,000 shares of
common stock. The Equity Plan provides for grants of non-statutory options                    74            ENGLOBAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, performance shares,
performance units, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards. Grants
to employees, if any, will vest over a four-year period, one-fifth at grant date
and one-fifth at December 31 of each year until they are fully vested. Grants to
non-employee directors will vest quarterly over a one-year period. The Company
anticipates that the shares available in the Equity Plan will be used primarily
to compensate non-employee directors.
Stock Options
- Consistent with ASC 718, Stock Compensation, the Company recognizes stock
compensation expense relating to share-based payments in net income using the
fair-value measurement method. Under the fair value method, the estimated fair
value of awards is charged to expense over the requisite service period, which
is generally the vesting period.
The fair value of the 2008 and 2007 options granted to employees is estimated on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as follows                         2008        2007

We estimate the volatility of our stock price by using historical volatility
looking back 156 weeks. We have considered using a combination of historical and
implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock but do not believe
that it would materially impact the company estimates of future volatility
over the expected life of the options. The expected term of options granted has
been derived from the simplified method, due to changes in vesting terms and
contractual lives of current options compared to our historical grants. We base
the estimate of the risk-free interest rate on the United States Treasury
zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. We have never paid cash
dividends and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends; accordingly, we
have assumed a 0% dividend yield.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 14 -REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK AUTHORIZED
During 2006, a new class of capital stock of the Company, consisting of
2,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0001 per share the Preferred
Stock, was approved by the Company stockholders to replace previously
authorized but not issued preferred shares. The Board of Directors has the
authority to approve the issuance of all or any portion of these shares of
Preferred Stock in one or more series, to determine the number of shares
constituting any series and to determine any voting powers, conversion rights,
dividend rights, and other designations, preferences, limitations, restrictions
and rights relating to such shares without any further action by the
stockholders. The designations, preferences, limitations, restrictions and
rights of any series of Preferred Stock designated by the Board of Directors
will be set forth in an amendment to the Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation Amended Articles filed in accordance with Nevada law.
The reason for authorizing this Preferred Stock is to provide the Company with
flexibility in connection with its future growth. Although the Company presently
has no intentions of issuing shares of Preferred Stock, opportunities may arise
that require the Board to act quickly, such as businesses becoming available for
acquisition or favorable market conditions for the sale of a particular type of
Preferred Stock. The Board believes that the authorization to issue Preferred
Stock is advisable in order to enhance the Company ability to respond to these
and similar opportunities.

The Company had a federal net operating loss carry-forward at December 31, 2009
of approximately $18,000. Earlier utilization of the net operating loss on the
Company 2002 and 2003 consolidated tax returns was disallowed by the IRS which
resulted in a reinstated carry-forward that will be available for utilization
from 2008 through 2010.
The Company also has a foreign net operating loss carry-forward at December 31,
2009 of approximately $14 million. This loss is available for utilization from
2008 through 2017; however, application of the net operating loss is restricted
to the income of ENGlobal Canada. The Company is unsure of its ability to fully
utilize the foreign net operating loss. Therefore, the Company has set up a
valuation allowance of $567,000 against the entire net operating loss.
On July 13, 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes, and Related Implementation Issues, which is now codified under ASC 740,
Income Taxes. This standard provides guidance on the financial statement
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions
that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. Under ASC 740,
financial statements should reflect expected future tax consequences of such
positions presuming the taxing authorities have full knowledge of the position
and all relevant facts. This interpretation also revises the disclosure
requirements and was adopted by the Company effective as of January 1, 2007.
There are currently no material tax positions identified as uncertain for the
Company or its' subsidiaries.
79            ENGLOBAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We recognize interest related to uncertain tax positions in interest expense and
penalties related to uncertain tax positions in governmental penalties. As of
December 31, 2009, we have not recognized interest or penalties relating to any
uncertain tax positions.
During 2007, the Company subsidiary, ENGlobal Land, Inc. was audited for the
pre-acquisition fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. There was no material
adjustment as a result of this audit, and it has been closed. The Company is
currently not the subject of any examination by the Internal Revenue Service,
and the open years subject to audit are currently tax years 2006-2008. In most
states where the Company conducts business, the Company is subject to
examination for the preceding three to six years.
NOTE 16 - SALE OF ASSET
During May 2008, the Company received cash proceeds of $382,000 upon completion
of the sale of property owned through, PEI Investments. The Company recognized a

NOTE 17 - SEGMENT INFORMATION
ENGlobal has four reportable segments: Engineering, Construction, Automation and
Land. Our segments are strategic business units that offer different services
and products and therefore require different marketing and management
strategies.
The Engineering segment provides consulting services relating to the
development, management and execution of projects requiring professional
engineering and related project services. Services provided by the Engineering
segment include feasibility studies, engineering, design, procurement, and
construction management. The Construction segment provides construction
management personnel and services in the areas of inspection, vendor and
turnaround management, plant asset management, commissioning and start-up,
instrumentation and electrical, mechanical integrity, field support and quality
assurance. The Automation segment provides services related to the design,
fabrication, and implementation of process distributed control and analyzer
systems, advanced automation, information technology and heat tracing projects.
The Land segment provides land management, right-of-way, environmental
compliance, legislative affairs support and governmental regulatory compliance
services primarily to the pipeline, utility and telecom companies and other
owner/operators of infrastructure facilities throughout the United States and
Canada.
Sales, operating income, identifiable assets, capital expenditures and
depreciation for each segment are set forth in the following table. The amount
identified as Corporate includes those activities that are not allocated to the
operating segments and include costs related to business development, executive
functions, finance, accounting, safety, human resources and information
technology that are not specifically identifiable with the segments. The
Corporate function supports all business segments and therefore cannot be
specifically assigned to any specific segment. A significant portion of
corporate costs are allocated to each segment based on each segment revenue
and subsequently eliminated in consolidation.

NOTE 18 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Employment Agreements
- The Company has employment agreements with certain of its executive officers and
certain other officers, the terms of which expire in December 2010, with the
severance terms ranging from six to twelve months. Such agreements provide for
minimum salary levels. If employment is terminated for any reason other than 1
termination for cause, 2 voluntary resignation, or 3 employee death, the
Company is obligated to provide a severance benefit equal to between six and
twelve months of the employee salary, and, at its option, an additional six
months at 50% to 100% of the employee salary in exchange for an extension of a
non-competition agreement. These agreements are renewable for an additional
one-year term at the Company option. No liability is recorded for the
Company obligations under employment agreements as the amounts that will
ultimately be paid cannot be reasonably estimated, if any.
Litigation
- From time to time, the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries is involved in
various legal proceedings or is subject to claims that arise in the ordinary
course of business alleging, among other things, claims of breach of contract or
negligence in connection with the performance or delivery of goods and/or
services, and the outcome of any such claims or proceedings cannot be predicted
with certainty. As of the date of this filing, all such active proceedings and
claims of substance that have been raised against any subsidiary business entity
have been adequately reserved for, or are covered by insurance, such that, if
determined adversely to those entities individually or in the aggregate, they
would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or
financial position.
Insurance
- The Company carries a broad range of insurance coverage, including general and
business automobile liability, commercial property, professional errors and
omissions, workers' compensation insurance and a general umbrella policy. The
Company is not aware of any claims in excess of insurance recoveries. ENGlobal
82            ENGLOBAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS is partially self-funded for health insurance claims. Provisions for expected
future payments are accrued based on the Company experience. Specific stop
loss levels provide protection for the Company with $200,000 per occurrence and
