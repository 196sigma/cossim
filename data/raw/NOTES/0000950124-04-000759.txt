Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data REPORT OF ERNST YOUNG LLP,
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS The Board of Directors and Stockholders Corixa Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Corixa Corporation as of December31,
2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December31, 2003.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Corixa Corporation at
December31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2003 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. As discussed in Note1 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company adopted the full provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No141,
Business Combinations, and No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, effective January1, 2002.

Description of Business and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies   
Description of Business and Basis of
Presentation We are a developer of innovative
immunotherapeutic products designed to affect the immune system
and treat debilitating and life-threatening conditions caused by
cancer and infectious disease. Originally founded to pursue development of
leading, proprietary antigen discovery technology, we are
emerging as a product development company with multiple product
candidates, many in late-stage human clinical trials. Our
development efforts are focused on core areas of immunotherapy
expertise, including monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and
adjuvants, and small molecules called TLR4 agonists and
antagonists that stimulate innate immunity. The consolidated financial statements include our
accounts and those of our wholly owned subsidiary, Coulter. All
significant intercompany account balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.   
Cash and Cash Equivalents All short-term investments, which consist
primarily of bankers acceptances and certificates of
deposit, with maturities of three months or less at date of
purchase, are considered to be cash equivalents. The amounts are
recorded at cost, which approximates fair market value.   
Securities Available-for-Sale Our investment portfolio is classified as
available-for-sale and is segregated into current and
non-current portions based on the remaining term of the
instrument. Investments with outstanding maturity dates of two
years or longer are classified as non-current. Our primary
investment objectives are preservation of principal, a high
degree of liquidity and a maximum total return. We invest
primarily in United States dollar denominated only: commercial
paper; short and mid-term corporate notes/bonds, with no more
than 10% of the portfolio in any one corporate issuer; and
federal agencies with terms not exceeding four years. Such
securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains
and losses reflected in stockholders equity. Interest
earned on securities is included in interest income. The
amortized cost of investments is adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such
amortization and accretions are included in interest income. The
cost of securities sold is calculated using the specific
identification method.   
Certain Concentrations Credit Risk. We are
subject to concentrations of credit risk, primarily from our
investments. Credit risk for investments is managed by the
purchase of investment-grade securities, A1/P1 for money market
instruments and A or better for debt instruments, and
diversification of the investment portfolio among issuers and
maturities. Suppliers. We have
contracted with a third-party manufacturer, BI Pharma KG, to
produce bulk Tositumomab, a key component of BEXXAR therapeutic
regimen for use in ongoing clinical trials and to meet
commercial requirements, as well as to provide for fill/finish
and packaging services. We have committed to purchase minimum
annual quantities of Tositumomab from BI Pharma KG. In February
2003, we amended our Supply Agreement with BI Pharma KG to
temporarily reduce our minimum annual order commitment for
Tositumomab following the commercial launch of BEXXAR
therapeutic regimen. The minimum annual order for 2004 is
approximately $29million. We have also contracted with a
third-party manufacturer, Nordion, for radiolabeling supply of
the Tositumomab component of BEXXAR therapeutic regimen at
Nordions centralized radiolabeling facility. In June 2003
we signed a new seven-year manufacturing agreement with Nordion
replacing the existing supply agreement. 65 Table of Contents CORIXA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued   
Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost and is
depreciated on the straight-line method over the assets
estimated useful lives, which range from three to seven years
for computers and equipment and twenty years for buildings.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their
estimated useful lives or the term of the lease.   
Acquisition-Related Intangible
Assets Effective January1, 2002, we adopted
SFAS141, Business Combinations and
SFAS142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. SFAS141 requires that the purchase
method of accounting be used for all business combinations
initiated after June30, 2001, and also specifies the
criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately
from goodwill. Under the new rules, goodwill is no longer
amortized but is subject to an impairment test at least annually
or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Separately
identified and recognized intangible assets resulting from
business combinations completed before July1, 2001, that
did not meet the new criteria for separate recognition of
intangible assets were subsumed in goodwill upon adoption. The
only intangible asset of the company that did not meet the
separate recognition criteria of SFAS141 was our assembled
workforce. We continue to amortize intangible assets that meet
the new criteria over their useful lives. A reconciliation of previously reported net loss
and net loss per share to the amounts adjusted for the exclusion
of goodwill amortization for the year-ended December31,
2001 as if we had adopted FAS142 on January1, 2001,
is as follows in thousands

On March12, 2002, we received a second
complete review letter from the FDA regarding our BLA for BEXXAR
therapeutic regimen. In the complete review letter, the FDA
stated that additional clinical studies would be required to
provide sufficient evidence of the safety and net clinical
benefit of BEXXAR therapeutic regimen. Upon announcement on March13, 2002 of the
receipt of the complete review letter from the FDA, the value of
our common stock declined which, in managements opinion
represented an indication of impairment of recorded goodwill. In
accordance with the requirements of SFAS142, an interim
test of goodwill impairment was performed as of March13,
2002. The impairment test involves a two-step approach. Under
step one of the test, we compared our estimated fair value the
reporting unit based upon the market price of our common stock
to the carrying value of our equity. Because the carrying value
of our equity exceeded our fair value, we performed step two of
the test, which involved allocating our fair value to all of our
assets and liabilities to determine how much, if any, of the
excess value should be allocated to goodwill. The results of the
impairment test indicated that no goodwill was present and
accordingly, we recognized a $1611million goodwill
impairment charge in the first quarter of 2002. 66 Table of Contents CORIXA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Acquisition-related intangible assets at
December31, 2003, consist of adjuvant know-how and an
assumed lease with balances of approximately $12million
and $20million, respectively. Adjuvant know-how and the
acquired lease are amortized on the straight-line method over
periods of seven and ten years, respectively. In the second and third quarters of 2003 we
subleased approximately 117,000square feet of our leased
facilities in South SanFrancisco. In accordance with
SFASNo144, long-lived assets must be reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of those long-lived assets might not be
recoverable. Upon entering into the sublease agreements an
estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to
the subleases was performed and was determined to be less than
the carrying amount of the intangible asset acquired lease,
related leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures.
Because the carrying value exceeded the fair value, we
recognized an impairment charge of $126million and
$59million in the second and third quarters of 2003,
respectively, related to these assets. Amortization of the remaining acquired lease is
recorded as additional rent expense. The expected future annual
amortization expense of our other acquisition-related intangible
assets is as follows in thousands

At December31, 2003 and 2002, we had

assets.   
Stock-Based Compensation We have adopted the disclosure-only provisions of
SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation and apply Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No25, or APB25, and related interpretations
in accounting for our stock option plans. Accordingly, our
employee stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on
the intrinsic value of the option on the date of grant. At December31, 2003 we had two stock-based
employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in
Note7. No stock-based employee compensation cost, other
than compensation associated with options assumed in
acquisitions, is reflected in net loss, as all options granted
under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market
value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The
following table illustrates 67 Table of Contents CORIXA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued the effect on net loss and net loss per share if

Stock compensation expense for options granted to
nonemployees has been determined in accordance with SFAS12
and EITF 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That
Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in
Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services, as the
fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of
the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably
measured. The fair value of options granted to nonemployees is
periodically re-measured as the underlying options vest.   
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.   
Other Financial Instruments As of December31, 2003 and
December31, 2002, the carrying value of financial
instruments such as receivables and payables approximated their
fair values, based on the short-term maturities of these
instruments. Additionally, the carrying value of long-term
liabilities approximated their fair values because the
underlying interest rates approximate market rates at the
balance sheet dates.   
Revenue We generate revenue from technology licenses,
collaborative research and development arrangements, cost
reimbursement contracts, co-promotion revenues under our
agreement with GSK for BEXXAR therapeutic regimen and sales of
research adjuvants. Revenue under technology licenses and
collaborative agreements typically consists of non-refundable
and/or guaranteed technology license fees, collaborative
research funding, technology access fees, and various milestone
and future product royalty or profit-sharing payments. Revenue associated with up-front license,
technology access and research and development funding payments
under collaborative agreements is recognized ratably over the
relevant periods specified in the respective agreements,
generally the research and development period. Revenue from
substantive at-risk milestones and future product royalties is
recognized upon completion of the milestones and adjuvant sales,
as defined in the respective agreements. Revenue under cost
reimbursement contracts is recognized as the related costs are
incurred. Co-promotion revenue or expense under our agreement
with GSK for BEXXAR therapeutic regimen is determined based on
the calculation of joint profit or loss as defined in the
agreement. Such amounts were not significant through
December31, 2003. Revenue from adjuvant sales is 68 Table of Contents CORIXA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued recognized upon customer acceptance of the
product. Payments received in advance of recognition as revenue
are recorded as deferred revenue. We recognized 77% of our
collaborative revenue in 2003 from five collaborative partners,
73% from five collaborative partners in 2002 and 84% from five
collaborative partners in 2001.   
Research and Development
Expenses Pursuant to SFASNo2,
Accounting for Research and Development Costs,
our research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
The value of acquired IPRD is charged to expense on the
date of acquisition. Research and development expenses include,
but are not limited to, payroll and personnel expense, lab
supplies, preclinical, outside manufacturing, legal fees and
consulting.   
Net Loss Per Share Basic net loss per share is calculated by
dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted
net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss
applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average common
shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock
options, stock warrants and preferred stock. Because we report a
net loss, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net
loss per share because the effect of outstanding stock options,
stock warrants and preferred stock being added to weighted
average shares outstanding would reduce the loss per share.
Therefore, outstanding stock options, stock warrants and
preferred stock are not included in the calculation.   
Segment Information We currently operate as a single segment under
SFASNo131, Disclosures About Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information.   
New Accounting Pronouncements In May 2003, FASB issued SFAS150.
SFAS150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies
and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics
of both liabilities and equity. SFAS150 is effective for
financial instruments entered into or modified after
May31, 2003. This Standard does not currently have any
impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial
position or disclosure. In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No46.
FIN No46 addresses consolidation by business enterprises
of variable interest entities that possess certain
characteristics. The interpretation requires that if a business
enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable
interest entity, the assets, liabilities and results of
operations of the variable interest entity must be included in
the consolidated financial statements with those of the business
enterprise. This interpretation applies immediately to variable
interest entities created after January31, 2003 and to
variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an
interest after that date. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN
No46R, which includes significant amendments to
previously issued FIN No46. Among other provisions, FIN
No46R includes revised transition dates for public
entities. We are now required to adopt the provisions of FIN
No46R no later than the end of the first reporting period
that ends after March15, 2004. The adoption of this
interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on our
financial statements or results of operations. Effective prospectively for arrangements entered
into in fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2003, EITF
Issue 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables, addresses the accounting by a vendor for
contractual arrangements in which multiple revenue-generating
activities will be performed by the vendor. In some situations,
the different revenue-generating activities
deliverablesare sufficiently separable and there exists
sufficient evidence of fair values to account separately for the
different deliverables that is 69 Table of Contents CORIXA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued there are separate units of accounting. In other
situations, some or all of the different deliverables are
interrelated closely or there is not sufficient evidence of fair
value to account separately for the different deliverables. EITF
Issue 00-21 addresses when and, if so, how an arrangement
involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate
units of accounting. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have
a material impact on our consolidated results of operations,
financial position or disclosure for the year-ended
December31, 2003. EIFT Issue 00-21 was effective for us
beginning July1, 2003. In July 2002, the FASB issued
SFASNo146. SFASNo146, which is
effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities
initiated after December31, 2002, applies to costs
associated with an exit activity, including restructurings, or
with a disposal of long-lived assets. Those activities can
include eliminating or reducing product lines, terminating
employees and contracts and relocating plant facilities or
personnel. SFASNo146 requires that exit or disposal
costs are recorded as an operating expense when the liability is
incurred and can be measured at fair value. We accounted for our
November 2003 restructuring, as discussed in Note11, in
accordance with SFASNo146.   
Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to the
prior years financial statements to conform to the 2003
presentation.   
2.
Scientific Collaborative and License
Agreements GSK. In October
1998, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement
effective September1, 1998 with GSK for multiple discovery
programs. In August 2002 the funded research and development
period of our collaboration and license agreement with GSK
terminated in all of the cancer fields covered by the agreement.
In October 2002 GSK extended the funded research and development
period for the programs for tuberculosis and chlamydia vaccines
through August 2004. We recognized revenue of $46million 117million and $137million in 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively, from this agreement. In January 2003, we and GSK entered into a new
agreement which extends our and GSKs collaborative efforts
into vaccine development and potential proof-of-principle
clinical trials. Under the terms of the new agreement, GSK
granted us a worldwide, exclusive license to develop a vaccine
candidate for prostate cancer and a vaccine candidate for breast
cancer. As a part of the agreement, GSK retains the option to
buy-back exclusive worldwide rights for either or both vaccine
candidates following the completion of proof-of-principle
clinical trials. If GSK exercises its buy-back rights, we have
the option of participating in further development, up to and
including a sharing of promotion rights in the United States.
The buy-back price will be based on our research costs incurred
under this new agreement plus a premium of 25% and up to an
additional $30million depending on the stage of
development at the time GSK exercises its buy-back option. In
the event GSK does not exercise its buy-back option, we will be
free to develop the vaccines alone or with other partners and
have agreed to pay GSK success-based milestones and royalties in
the event of product sales. Under our new agreement, we will be
responsible for providing resources and development funding of
up to $32million to complete proof-of-principle clinical
studies over a period of time in excess of five years. This
funding will be used to pay for GMP grade material, production
and clinical trials for prostate and breast vaccine development
efforts. GSK purchased $25million of our common
stock in 1998 at a premium to our fair market value.
Additionally, the loan in principal amount of $5million
from GSK under a prior collaboration agreement was due on
September1, 2003. At GSKs option, GSK may chose to
receive repayment of this loan in cash or shares of our common
stock at a specified premium to the five day average closing
price of our common stock 70 Table of Contents CORIXA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued for the period immediately preceding
September1, 2003. GSK has not yet made its election
regarding the form or repayment and accordingly the
$5million loan remains outstanding. We have a collaborative agreement with GSK for
the development and commercialization of BEXXAR therapeutic
regimen, which was approved by the FDA on June27, 2003 for
the treatment of patients with CD20 positive, follicular,
non-Hodgkins lymphoma, or NHL, with and without
transformation, whose disease is refractory to Rituximab and has
relapsed following chemotherapy. Under the terms of the
agreement, both companies contribute to the commercialization
efforts of BEXXAR therapeutic regimen in the United States and
share profits and losses from GSKs sales of BEXXAR
therapeutic regimen equally. We recognize the costs we incur associated with
BEXXAR therapeutic regimen related activities such as the cost
of co-promotion revenue and sales and promotion costs in our
statement of operations. We and GSK then prepare a quarterly
calculation of the joint profit or loss which considers all
revenue and costs associated with BEXXAR therapeutic regimen
commercial activities incurred by us and GSK and the equal
sharing of the joint profit or loss. If the quarterly joint
profit or loss calculation results in a reimbursement to Corixa,
we record that amount as revenue. If the quarterly joint profit
or loss calculation results in a payment by Corixa, we record
that amount as additional operating expense. Prior to
commercialization, we recorded our share of the net
reimbursement or payment from the joint profit or loss
calculation in sales, general and administrative expenses. For
the year ended December31, 2003 our actual commercial
costs related to BEXXAR therapeutic regimen and the payment
resulting from the joint profit or loss calculation are included
in sales, general and administrative expenses. Additionally, the agreement provides that we and
GSK will share certain costs related to clinical and
manufacturing development activities and that we will receive
additional payments from the achievement of certain clinical
development and regulatory milestones. Development expenses are
included in research and development expenses, and reimbursement
revenue is included in revenue from collaborative agreements. In
the second quarter of 2003 we recognized milestone revenue from
our collaborative agreement with GSK for the FDA approval of
BEXXAR therapeutic regimen. We recognized reimbursement and milestone revenue
of $52million, $7million and $129million in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively under the terms of this
agreement. We also have an outstanding balance of
$15million under a credit line related to our
collaborative agreement with GSK for BEXXAR therapeutic regimen
as described in footnote6. Borrowings under the credit
line are due in October 2004. We are subject to certain
financial covenants including liquidity and net worth covenants
as defined in the agreement. At December31, 2003, we were
in compliance with these covenants. Quarterly interest payments,
due in arrears, are at a fixed interest rate of 95%. Interest
expense for 2003 was approximately $14million. At our
sole discretion, we may repay the principal in either cash or
common stock. Payment in our common stock would be based upon
the fair market value of our common stock at the time of payment. We have several license and supply agreements
with GSK whereby we have licensed certain adjuvants for use in
vaccines that GSK is developing for infectious diseases, cancer
and allergy. These agreements grant GSK exclusive and
co-exclusive license rights depending on the disease field and
territory. Under the terms of the agreements, GSK pays annual
license fees, milestones, transfer payments and future royalty
payments. We recognized revenue of $48million in 2003 and
$43million in 2002 and $28million in 2001 in
connection with these agreements. Amounts receivable from GSK
under these agreements at December31, 2003 and 2002 were
$41million and $62million, respectively. Amersham Health. In
October 2001, we entered into an agreement whereby Amersham
Health has agreed to market BEXXAR therapeutic regimen in
Europe. We and Amersham Health will cooperate to register the
product in Europe. We will initially be the holder of the MAA
for BEXXAR therapeutic regimen in Europe, and after certain
conditions have been met, including approval for commercial sale
in Europe, we 71 Table of Contents CORIXA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued will transfer the MAA to Amersham Health. We will
be responsible for generating clinical trial data to support the
registration of BEXXAR therapeutic regimen in Europe and
Amersham Health will be responsible for manufacture and sale of
BEXXAR therapeutic regimen in Europe. Under the terms of a stock
purchase agreement with Amersham Health we had the option to
sell up to a total of $15million of shares of our common
stock to Amersham Health. Upon execution of the agreement
Amersham Health purchased 271,343shares of our common
stock for a total of $5million, or $1843per share,
which represented a premium to the then current market value of
our common stock of approximately forty percent or
$14million. The premium has been accounted for as a
nonrefundable license payment and was deferred and will be
recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement,
consistent with our revenue recognition policy. Following our
partial option exercises in October 2001 and December 2002, on
May14, 2003, we completed the exercise of our option to
sell up to $15million of shares of our common stock to
Amersham Health when we sold 721,814shares of our common
stock to Amersham Health at a price per share of $6927 for a
total purchase price of approximately $5million. In
addition, Amersham Health has agreed to pay us milestone
payments upon regulatory approval in the territory and
achievement of certain sales volume targets. Amersham Health has
agreed to pay us royalties on all future product sales in
Europe. We recognized revenue from this agreement of
approximately $389,000 in 2003 and 2002. Wyeth. We have
several license and supply agreements with Wyeth, granting Wyeth
licenses to certain adjuvants for use in vaccines for certain
infectious and autoimmune disease fields that Wyeth is
developing. These agreements grant Wyeth exclusive, co-exclusive
and non-exclusive license rights depending on the disease field.
Under the terms of the agreements, Wyeth pays annual license
fees, milestones, transfer payments and future royalty payments.
We recognized revenue of $25million, $20million
and $906,000 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Zambon Group and JT.
During May and June 1999, we entered into corporate partnerships
with Zambon and JT, respectively, for the research, development
and commercialization of vaccine products aimed at preventing
and treating lung cancer. Zambon has exclusive rights to develop
and sell vaccine products in Europe, the countries of the former
Soviet Union, Argentina, Brazil and Columbia and co-exclusive
rights in China. Under the June 1999 agreement, we granted JT
exclusive rights to develop and sell vaccine products outside of
the territory licensed to Zambon, including the United States
and Japan, and co-exclusive rights to develop and sell vaccine
products in China. We also granted Zambon a nonexclusive license
and JT an option to formulate vaccines that may result from the
collaboration using our microsphere delivery system with our
proprietary adjuvants. During 2002, the three-year research
terms of the agreements expired and the respective research
funding obligations ceased. In November 2002, we and Zambon
amended our agreement so that we jointly fund clinical testing
of a non- small cell lung cancer vaccine. In December 2002, we
recorded a milestone payment of $10million from Zambon in
connection with the filing of our IND for a lung cancer vaccine
candidate in the United States. In January 2003, we amended and
restated our agreement with JT so that we hold exclusive rights
to all antigens discovered in our lung cancer vaccine program in
all countries previously licensed to JT, with the exception of
rights associated with commercialization of a non small cell,
lung carcinoma vaccine candidate in Japan. Under the terms of
our amended agreement with JT, JT will continue to hold an
exclusive license to this vaccine candidate for development and
commercialization in Japan, and we will hold all rights in North
America and in those territories not previously licensed to
Zambon. In connection with the restructuring of the JT
agreement, we and JT have agreed to pay each other fees,
milestones and royalties in the event that development
milestones and product sales are achieved. We recognized revenue
of $993,000, $69million and $77million in
connection with the Zambon and JT agreements in 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. Amounts receivable from Zambon at
December31, 2003 were zero as compared to
$12million at December31, 2002. Kirin. In December
2002, we entered into a multiyear development and
commercialization agreement with Kirin for potential cancer
vaccine for the treatment of multiple forms of cancer, including
leukemia, myelodysplasia and melanoma. Under the agreement we
grant Kirin exclusive rights to develop and market 72 Table of Contents CORIXA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued vaccine products resulting from our WT1 antigen
vaccine program in Asia/ Australasia. We and Kirin have agreed
to share WT1 vaccine commercialization rights and Kirin will
fund one-half of the research and development cost in North
America. We will retain marketing rights for the potential
vaccine in Europe. Upon effectiveness of the agreement, Kirin
paid us $3million in up-front license fees which will be
recorded as revenue over the estimated research and development
term of the agreement of approximately nine years. Under the
terms of the agreement, Kirin will co-fund development of WT1
vaccine products and has agreed to pay us success-based
milestone payments and royalties on future product sales in
Asia/ Australasia. We recognized revenue related to this
agreement of approximately $23million in 2003. Medicis and Zenyaku
Kogyo. In August 2000, we entered into
a multiyear development, commercialization and license agreement
with Medicis covering our psoriasis immunotherapeutic product,
PVAC treatment. Under the agreement we grant Medicis exclusive
rights to PVAC treatment in the United States and Canada.
Medicis made a nonrefundable payment of $17million upon
effectiveness of the agreement. We recognized revenue from this
agreement of $79million, $31million and
$46million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In August 1999, we entered into a corporate
partnership with Zenyaku Kogyo for researching and developing
PVAC treatment in Japan. In May 2002, the three year research
term of the agreement expired and Zenyaku Kogyos research
funding obligation ceased. Zenyaku Kogyos exclusive rights
to PVAC treatment in Japan continue and they are responsible for
future milestone payments based on successful clinical and
commercial progress, and royalties on future product sales. We
recognized revenue of approximately $13million in 2003,
as compared to $20million in 2002 and $22million
in 2001, in connection with the agreement. In December 2003 we announced that we have
discontinued development of PVAC treatment due to phaseII
trial results that confirmed PVAC therapy failed to provide a
statistically significant benefit versus placebo. We also
terminated our license agreement with Medicis. As a result of
discontinuing development of PVAC treatment, we recognized
$5million of revenue and $25million of expense that
was previously deferred and was related to the initial Medicis
payment received in 2000. We developed PVAC treatment in collaboration with
New Zealand-based Genesis. We paid Genesis $81million in
2000, as a result of payments received from Medicis. We also
paid $900,000 to SR Pharma, our licensor for certain
intellectual property related to PVAC treatment. These payments
were being amortized over the period the related Medicis
revenues were being recognized. As a result of the
discontinuance of the development of PVAC treatment, we
recognized the remaining balance of $25million. Other Agreements. We
have various other collaborative research agreements with
academic universities and research institutions, which expire at
various intervals through 2003. Certain agreements stipulate the
reimbursement by us of research costs incurred by these
universities and institutions on our behalf. Included in
research and development expenses for the years ended
December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 are reimbursements by us
to these universities and institutions of approximating
$56million, $87million and $91million,
respectively. Certain 2003 collaborative agreements extend into
2004, and as of December31, 2003, we are committed to
reimburse these universities and institutions approximately
$272,000 in 2004. We have entered into certain license agreements
and obtained options to negotiate license agreements under the
terms of which we received license, technology and patent
rights. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, we paid initial license
and/or option fees approximating $881,000, $776,000 and
$12million, respectively. In addition, we issued
9,599shares of common stock and options valued at $55,637
during 2002, in exchange for such rights. No common stock or
options were issued in 2003 or 2001. All such amounts were
expensed when paid and are included in research and development
expense as the related technology was in development, and did
not have alternative future uses. 73 Table of Contents CORIXA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Certain agreements call for royalty and milestone
payments to be paid by us. The agreements are for terms from 10
to 17years or the expiration of the last issued patent
within the licensed technology, unless terminated earlier for
certain specified events, as defined in the respective
agreements. Additionally, we have entered into research and
license and supply agreements and granted rights to other
parties to negotiate license agreements under the terms of which
we provide license, technology and patent rights and quantities
of product for research and clinical development purposes. Under
the terms of the agreements, we will receive additional license
fees, option fees and/or reimbursement of certain research and
development costs and product sales revenue. The agreements may
also provide for one-time payments upon achieving certain
milestones and the payment of royalties based on product sales. We estimate that research and development
expenses incurred under these scientific collaborative and
license agreements were approximately $764million 750million and $996million in 2003, 2002 and 2001. Because of the large number of research projects
we have ongoing at any one time, and the ability to utilize
resources across several projects, the majority of our research
and development costs are not directly tied to any individual
project and are allocated among multiple projects. Our project
management is based primarily on scientific data and
supplemented by these cost allocations, which are based
primarily on human resource time incurred on each project. The
costs allocated to a project as a result do not necessarily
reflect the actual costs of the project. Accordingly, we do not
maintain actual cost incurred information for our projects on a
project-by-project basis. Costs attributed to research and
preclinical projects largely represent our pipeline generating
activities. Costs associated with clinical development programs
represent the advancement of these activities into product
candidates.

The credit line and loan from a corporate partner
consists of a $5million loan received in exchange for
options to license two of our early-stage cancer vaccines under
a prior collaboration agreement and a $15million credit
line related to our collaboration agreement for BEXXAR
therapeutic regimen refer to Note2 with regard to the
terms and conditions of the credit line. The $15million
line matures in October 2004 and accrues interest at a fixed
rate per annum of 95%, or the maximum permissible by law,
whichever is less. Under the terms of the note, we are required
to meet the following minimum covenants: iremaining
months liquidity, iidebt service coverage ratio,
iiitangible net worth, and ivleverage ratio. As
of December31, 2003, we were in compliance with these
covenants. The $5million loan is non-interest bearing and
matured on September1, 2003. At GSKs option, GSK may
elect to receive the repayment in cash or shares of our common
stock at a specified premium to the five day average closing
price of our common stock for the period immediately preceding
September1, 2003. GSK has not yet made its election
regarding the form of repayment and accordingly the
$5million loan remains outstanding. As of December31, 2003, we had outstanding
bank loans of $138million. This amount is composed of
loans with two financial institutions BNP Paribas and GE
Capital. The BNP loans require quarterly interest and
principal payments and begin maturing in May 2004 through August
2005. The loans bear an average rate of interest of 26%, which
is a function of either the London InterBank Offering Rate, or
LIBOR, or the prime rate of a major bank or federal fund. Under the terms of the notes, we are required to
meet the following minimum covenants: itangible net
worth, iinet cash calculated based on the sum of the
principal balance plus the interest reserve under the note plus
a multiple of our actual cash burn or $37,500,000, whichever is
greater, iiitotal debt to net worth ratios, and
ivcurrent ratio. As of December31, 2003, we were
in compliance with the covenants. The GE Capital loans require monthly interest and
principal payments and expire beginning in February 2005 through
November 2008. The loans bear interest at an average rate of
45%. Deferred charges, deposits and other assets include
$35million that secures our obligations under the GE
Capital loans. In June 2003, we sold $100million of
425%convertible subordinated notes due in 2008 to a
qualified institutional buyer pursuant to Rule144A under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes are
convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of
$9175, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. At the
initial conversion price, each $1,000 in principal amount of
notes will be convertible into approximately
1089918shares of our common stock. The initial conversion
price represents a 25% premium over the last reported sale of
our common stock on June9, 2003. The notes will be
subordinate to our existing and future senior indebtedness. We
will pay interest on the notes on January 1 and July1 of
each year, beginning on January1, 2004. The notes mature
on July1, 2008. We received net proceeds of approximately
$963million after deducting underwriting commissions and
offering expenses. Debt issuance costs of 76 Table of Contents CORIXA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued 37million are being amortized to interest
expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest
method. On or after July5, 2005, we may redeem the
notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption price, which is
100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, to the date of redemption; provided, however, that if
the redemption date is before July1, 2007, we may redeem
the notes only if the closing price of our common stock exceeds
140% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in any
consecutive 30-day trading period and if certain other
conditions are met. In certain circumstances, the holders of the
notes may require us to repurchase the notes upon a change
in control, as defined in the agreement. Minimum future debt payments under all long-term

renew for two additional five-year periods. We have issued a
standby letter of credit in the amount of $22million and
have a security deposit of $225,000 in connection with this
lease. At December31, 2003, non-current securities
available-for-sale included certificates of deposit of
$43million that secure a financing agreement and
$22million that secure letters of credit related to our
leased properties. In October 2002, we entered into a lease
agreement with Life Sciences Building, LLC to house our future
headquarters at the Ninth Stewart Lifesciences
Building in Seattle, Washington. The lease provides us with
approximately 138,000square feet of office and laboratory
space. The lease will commence on November1, 2004 if
certain improvements to the building are substantially completed
and the term of the lease is 15years. In January 2003 we
guaranteed a portion of our obligations under the lease in the
form of a letter of credit in the amount of approximately
$45million. 77 Table of Contents CORIXA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Stockholders Equity   
Preferred Stock In April 1999, we entered into an agreement with
Castle Gate, L.L.C., an investment partnership focused primarily
on health-care and biomedical companies, to provide us with an
equity line of credit of up to $50million, or the Line.
Upon execution of the agreement, we completed an initial draw
under the Line of $125million, or the Initial Draw, and
issued Castle Gate 12,500shares of SeriesA preferred
stock and warrants to purchase 1,037,137shares of common
stock, or the Initial Closing Warrants. The Initial Closing
Warrants consist of warrants to purchase 312,500 and
724,637shares of common stock at exercise prices of
$850per share and $828per share, respectively. The
conversion price for the SeriesA preferred stock issued in
the Initial Draw is $850per share. Under the terms of the agreement, we issued
warrants on the first and second anniversaries of the Line equal
to $1125million and $10million of common stock
respectively, based on the value of our common stock. These
warrants had a value of $53million at the time we entered
into the agreement and were included in equity. Accordingly, on
April8, 2001 and April8, 2000, we issued warrants to
purchase 130,028 and 30,540shares of common stock at $769
and $3684per share, respectively. On December29, 2000, we drew down the
remaining $375million under the Line by issuing
37,500shares of SeriesB preferred stock. The
SeriesB preferred stock has the same rights and
preferences as the SeriesA preferred stock issued at the
time of the Initial Draw in April 1999. In addition, we issued
warrants to purchase 237,500shares of common stock,
consisting of a warrant to purchase 187,500shares of
common stock as required under the terms of the Line and an
additional warrant to purchase 50,000shares of common
stock, at an exercise price of $1822per share. The
conversion price of the SeriesB preferred stock is
$2558per share. On the dates of the initial and remaining draws,
the effective conversion prices of the SeriesA and B
preferred stock after allocating a portion of the proceeds to
the common stock warrants based on the relative fair values of
the two instruments were at a discount to the price of the
common stock into which the preferred stock was convertible. The
discount of $55million in 1999 and $93million in
2000 related to the SeriesA and SeriesB preferred
stock, was recorded as preferred stock dividends. The preferred stock has an annual cumulative
dividend rate of 5% and may be paid, at our option, in cash or
in shares of our common stock. If we elect to pay in common
stock the number of shares issued is calculated as the cash
dividend amount divided by the stated conversion price of the
respective preferred 78 Table of Contents CORIXA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued stock. The Preferred Stock may be converted into
common stock at the option of Castle Gate at any time following
issuance. Beginning on the fourth anniversary of issuance,
shares of outstanding preferred stock will be converted into
common stock if the price of our common stock exceeds the
preferred stock conversion price by at least 30%, as specified
in the agreement. Additionally, any shares of Preferred Stock
that have not been converted previously will be converted
automatically on the seventh anniversary of issuance.
SeriesA and SeriesB preferred shares have voting
rights based on the number of common shares into which the
preferred shares are convertible. In the event of liquidation,
the preferred stockholders share pro rata with common
stockholders. We elected to pay the 2002 annual dividend on the
SeriesA preferred stock in shares of our common stock by
issuing 73,529shares of common stock in April 2003. The
value of these shares at the time of issuance was approximately
$529,000, which was approximately $96,000 less than the cash
dividend value of $625,000. In addition, we elected to pay the
2003 annual dividend on the SeriesB preferred stock in
shares of our common stock by issuing 73,299shares of our
common stock in December 2003. The value of these shares at the
time of issuance was approximately $438,000, which was
approximately $15million less than the cash dividend
value of $19million. The dividends have been recorded
based on the fair value of the common stock issued. We are accruing the dividend at the lower of the
cash dividend amount or the current fair value of the shares to
be issued.   
Common Stock On September11, 2003, we delivered a draw
down notice to BNY Capital Markets, Inc., or CMI, in accordance
with the terms of the equity line financing agreement between us
and CMI and, as a result, a draw down period commenced on
September15, 2003 and terminated on October10, 2003.
Pursuant to the equity line financing agreement, CMI purchased
an aggregate of 291,334shares of our common stock at an
average price per share of $858 for a total purchase price of
approximately $2,500,000. The price at which CMI purchased these
shares from us was established under the equity line financing
agreement by reference to prices of our common stock on the
Nasdaq National Market for the period beginning on
September15, 2003 and ending on October10, 2003, net
of a discount of 2%. In June 2003, we completed the sale of
3,719,085shares of newly issued common stock and issued
five-year warrants to purchase 669,435shares of our common
stock at an exercise price of $8044per share, in a
private placement to institutional investors. We sold the newly
issued common stock for $8044per share and we issued the
warrants at a purchase price of $0125per share. We
received net proceeds of approximately $284million, after
deducting underwriting fees and offering expenses. In April 2003, we exercised our option to sell
721,814shares of common stock to Amersham Health at a
price per share of $6927, for a total purchase price of
$5million. We sold the shares of common stock pursuant to
our October 2001 collaboration agreement with Amersham Health. In August 2002, we completed the sale of
7,322,562shares of newly issued common stock and issued
five-year warrants to purchase 1,244,836shares of our
common stock at an exercise price of $613per share, in a
private placement to select institutional and other accredited
investors. We sold the newly issued common stock for
$613per share and we issued the warrants at a purchase
price of $125per share. We received net proceeds of
approximately $428million, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and before deducting expenses payable
by us.   
Redeemable Common Stock In May 1999, we issued 141,576shares of our
common stock for $2,000,000, or $1413per share, to Zambon
in connection with a collaboration agreement. Under the terms of
the collaboration agreement 79 Table of Contents CORIXA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Zambon had the right to sell the common stock
back to us for the original purchase price at the end of the
research program term if Zambon determines that a commercial
product was not viable. This right expired in December 2002
subsequent to the end of the research program term. The
redeemable common stock has been reclassified on the
December31, 2002 balance sheet into stockholders
equity.   
Stock Option Plans In June 2001, we amended and restated the Amended
and Restated 1994 Stock Option Plan, and redesignated it the
2001 Stock Incentive Plan, or 2001 Plan. The amendment provides
for an increase in the shares available for issuance by
924,950shares to 7,500,000shares subject to an
annual increase equal to three percent of the outstanding common
stock as of the last trading day of the prior fiscal year, up to
a maximum annual increase of 2,000,000shares. In addition,
under the merger agreement with Coulter, we assumed their stock
option plans. As a result, we assumed options to purchase
approximately 5,614,535shares. As of December31,
2003, the 2001 Plan had 10,467,752shares of common stock
reserved for issuance to employees, directors and consultants.
The amendment also provides that we may grant stock awards and
stock appreciation rights, or SARs, under the 2001 plan. Options
granted under the 2001 Plan may be designated as incentive or
nonqualified at the discretion of the plan administrator. Generally, options become exercisable over a
four-year period with 25% vesting on the first year anniversary
of the date of grant and the remainder vesting monthly
thereafter. All options expire no later than ten years from the
date of grant. Incentive stock options are exercisable at not
less than the fair market value of the stock at the date of
grant, and nonqualified stock options are exercisable at prices
determined at the discretion of the plan administrator, but not
less than 85% of the fair market value of the stock at the date
of grant. The plan administrator has the discretion to grant
options that are exercisable for unvested shares of common stock
and, to the extent that an optionee holds options for such
unvested shares upon termination, we have the right to
repurchase any or all of the unvested shares at the per-share
exercise price paid by the optionee for the unvested shares. We adopted the 1997 Directors Stock Option
Plan, or the Directors Plan, on July25, 1997. As of
December31, 2003, 422,084shares of common stock were
reserved for issuance under the Directors Plan. The number
of shares reserved for issuance is subject to an automatic
increase on the first trading day of each of the five calendar
years beginning in 1998 and ending in 2002, in an amount equal
to 50,000shares or such lesser amount as the board of
directors may establish. The Directors Plan provides for
the grant of nonqualified stock options to nonemployee
directors. The Directors Plan provides that each person
who first became a nonemployee director shall be granted
nonqualified stock options to purchase 15,000shares of
common stock, or the First Option. Thereafter, on the first day
of each fiscal year, commencing in fiscal 1998, each nonemployee
director shall be automatically granted an additional option to
purchase 5,000shares of common stock, or a Subsequent
Option, if, on such date, he or she shall have served on our
board of directors for at least six months. The First Options
and Subsequent Options generally vest over 36 and
12months, respectively, and have 10-year terms. The
exercise price of such options shall be equal to the fair market
value of our common stock on the date of grant. The
Directors Plan has a 10-year term, unless terminated
earlier. In April and June of 2001, we cancelled
approximately 19million employee stock options with
exercise prices ranging from $2513 to $5119. We granted
approximately 18million replacement options in October
and December 2001 with exercise prices equal to the then current
fair market value of the underlying stock. Each replacement
option has an equivalent vesting schedule to the option that was
exchanged. 80 Table of Contents CORIXA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

At December31, 2002 and 2001, we had
5,512,155 and 4,585,061 options exercisable, respectively. In 2003 we issued 33,500shares of common
stock previously granted to certain former Coulter employees
upon the FDA approval of BEXXAR therapeutic regimen. We recorded
expense of $247,000 as a result of the stock issuance. 81 Table of Contents CORIXA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Deferred compensation of approximately
$292million was recorded at December31, 2000, as a
result of the merger with Coulter, which represented the
difference between the exercise prices of options assumed from
Coulter and their fair market values. Deferred compensation
expense of approximately $188,000, $15million and
$147million was recognized for the years ended
December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In 2003 and
2002, approximately $80,000 and $19million, respectively
of deferred compensation was reversed related to employees that
terminated employment during the year. Included in options outstanding at
December31, 2003 are approximately 182,000 options granted
to consultants for services. Expense of approximately $101,000
and $444,000 was recorded in 2003 and 2001, respectively,
related to options granted to consultants. A reduction to
expense of $168,000 was recorded in 2002 related to options
granted to consultants due to the decline in our stock price.   
Employee Stock Purchase Plan On July25, 1997, we adopted the 1997
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the Purchase Plan. Effective
June1, 2001, we amended and restated the Purchase Plan and
redesignated it the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the
2001 ESPP. The amendment provided for an immediate increase in
the shares available for issuance by 375,000shares to
500,000shares subject to an annual increase of not more
than 500,000shares in any calendar year. As of
December31, 2003, 340,847shares of common stock were
reserved for issuance under the 2001 ESPP. The 2001 ESPP permits
eligible employees to enroll in a two year offering period with
eight three-month purchase periods and to purchase shares of our
common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85%
of the fair market value of our common stock on the first day of
the applicable two year offering period or the last day of the
date of applicable purchase six-month offering period, whichever
is lower. The number of authorized shares is subject to
automatic increase on the first trading day of each of the 20
calendar years beginning in 1998 and ending in 2017. If the
number of shares reserved for issuance is less than 1% of the
outstanding common stock, the number of shares reserved for
issuance shall be increased until it equals 1% of the
outstanding common stock up to a maximum of 500,000shares
in any calendar year, or such lower amount as determined by the
board of directors. The board of directors has the power to
amend or terminate the 2001 ESPP as long as such action does not
adversely affect any outstanding rights to purchase stock under
the 2001 ESPP. The 2001 ESPP has a 20-year term, unless
terminated earlier. In 2003, 159,153shares were issued under
the 2001 ESPP at $528per share. In 2002,
137,663shares were issued under the 2001 ESPP at a price
of $524per share. In 2001, 124,575shares were
issued under the 2001 ESPP at prices ranging from $884 to
$2348per share.   
Pro Forma Information Pro forma information regarding net loss and loss
per share required by SFAS123 as disclosed in Note1
has been determined as if we had accounted for our employee
stock options under the fair value method of SFAS123. The

Stock Warrants We had common stock warrants outstanding to
purchase 3,518,900shares of common stock as of
December31, 2003 at a weighted average exercise price of
approximately $831per share, which warrants expire
between 2004 and 2010. Included in the total common stock

Income Taxes At December31, 2003 and 2002, we had net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$5118million and $4465million, respectively, and
research and experimentation credit carryforwards of
approximately $224million and $206million,
respectively, which begin to expire in 2005. Utilization of net
operating loss and research and development tax credit
carryforwards is subject to certain limitations under
Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code.
During the period 1995 through 2003, we experienced ownership
changes as defined by the Code. Accordingly, our use of losses
incurred through the date of any ownership changes will be
limited on an annual basis during the carryforward period,
therefore some of the carryforwards will expire without being
fully utilized. 83 Table of Contents CORIXA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects
of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for income tax purposes. We have recognized a valuation
allowance equal to the deferred tax assets due to the
uncertainty of realizing the benefits of the assets. The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets increased
$232million during 2003, $185million during 2002
and $301million during 2001. The effects of temporary
differences and carryforwards that give rise to deferred tax

401k Plan We have a tax-qualified employee savings and
retirement plan, or the 401k Plan, covering all of our
employees. Pursuant to the 401k Plan, employees may elect to
reduce their current compensation by up to the statutorily
prescribed annual limit $12,000 in 2003 and to have the amount
of such reduction contributed to the 401k Plan. Effective
January1, 1998, we implemented a 401k matching program
whereby we contribute twenty-five cents for each dollar a
participant contributes, with a maximum contribution of 25% of
the first 8% of a participants earnings not to exceed 25%
of the prescribed annual limit. The 401k Plan is intended to
qualify under Section401 of the Code so that contributions
by employees or by us to the 401k Plan, and income earned on
401k Plan contributions, are not taxable to employees until
withdrawn from the 401k Plan, and so that contributions by us,
if any, will be deductible by us when made. At the direction of
each participant, we invest the assets of the 401k Plan in any
of eleven investment options. Our contributions under the 401k
Plan were approximately $486,000 in 2003, $500,000 in 2002 and
$577,000 in 2001.

Sale of Technology and Other Assets In May 2002, Medarex purchased our proprietary
UPT technology for creating antibody-toxin conjugates and
certain preclinical product development programs in the field of
oncology and other disease indications. In return, we received
$21million, which was paid in six equal monthly payments.
These payments are included in other income in the accompanying
statement of operations. Medarex also purchased certain
equipment to support Medarexs continuing research efforts
from Corixa for an additional $25million. We recorded a
gain on the sale of fixed assets to Medarex of approximately
$1million in the second quarter of 2002. In 2003 we
received an additional $25million contingent
consideration related to the preclinical asset sale. 84 Table of Contents CORIXA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Restructuring charges In November 2003, we announced the restructuring
of our operations including a workforce reduction of
approximately 18percent, which includes the elimination of
unfilled open positions, as well as select existing positions.
The restructuring charge for the fourth quarter of 2003 was
$23million and consisted of employee severance, benefits
and outplacement services. As of December31, 2003 we had
paid $14million of the total restructuring charge. The
remaining severance, benefits and outplacement services will be
paid in 2004.

Commitments and Contingencies Biogen Idec, has challenged the validity of our
United States Patent Nos. 5,595,721, 5,843,398, 6,015,542,
6,090,365, 6,022,521, 6,251,362 and 6,287,537 related to BEXXAR
therapeutic regimen by seeking declaratory judgment of
invalidity of these patents. Biogen Idec is also seeking a
declaratory judgment that its Zevalin product for the treatment
of NHL is not infringing the patents. We, GSK and the Regents of
the University of Michigan are parties to a lawsuit against
Biogen Idec alleging patent infringement of our United States
Patent Nos. 5,595,721, 6,015,542, 6,090,365 and 6,287,537 by
Zevalin and seeking monetary damages and permanent injunctive
relief. Claims in the patents at issue in the litigation cover
composition of matter and methods-of-use in the treatment of
NHL. On October14, 2003, the United States District Court,
Southern District of California granted Biogen Idecs
motion for summary judgment that the 5,595,721, 6,015,542,
6,090,365 and 6,287,537 patents are unenforceable due to
inequitable conduct before the United States Patent and
Trademark Office. On November13, 2003 Corixa, GSK and the
Regents of the University of Michigan filed a motion for
reconsideration with the United States District Court, Southern
District of California requesting that the court reconsider
its October14, 2003 order. On January22, 2004,
the United States District Court, Southern District of
California granted the motion for reconsideration, vacated the
October14, 2003 order and denied Biogen Idecs motion
for summary judgment of inequitable conduct. On June2, 2003, Biogen Idec moved to amend
its complaint to add a claim for declaratory judgment relief of
non-infringement and invalidity of our U.S.Patent
No6,565,827. Issued Patent No6,565,827 covers
composition of matter used in the treatment of NHL. On that same
day, Biogen Idec also filed a separate lawsuit in the United
States District Court, Southern District of California, seeking
declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of this
same patent. On August11, 2003, the judge denied Biogen
Idecs motion to amend the complaint to include this patent
in the originally filed lawsuit or, alternatively, to
consolidate the first filed lawsuit with the one filed on
June2, 2003. Subsequently, on December16, 2003,
Biogen Idec filed with the United States District Court,
Southern District of California, a notice of voluntary dismissal
without prejudice for the June2, 2003 lawsuit. In addition, on February25, 2003, Biogen
Idec filed a complaint in the United States District Court,
Southern District of California, against us and GSK for patent
infringement of United States Reissue Patent No.RE38,008,
which claims, among other things, methods of enhancing the
delivery of conjugated specific antibodies to solid tumor target
cells. See Note13 for recent developments related
to this litigation. We are party to routine claims and litigation
incidental to our business. We believe the ultimate resolution
of these routine matters will not have a material adverse effect
on our financial position and results of operations or cash
flows.

Subsequent Events On March1, 2004 we announced that we and
GSK have reached a settlement with Biogen Idec regarding all
outstanding patent litigation between us and Biogen Idec. The
settlement, which serves as the basis for the dismissal of all
patent litigation between the parties, provides for Biogen Idec
to pay to us and GSK a $20million upfront settlement
payment, as well as a one-time milestone payment based on future 85 Table of Contents CORIXA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

IV, L.P., or NDC, of which Wells Fargo Community Development
Corporation is a limited partner, pursuant to a promissory note

bears interest at LIBOR plus 08%. NDC will forgive a portion of
the loan if we are in compliance the terms and conditions of the
note and the credit agreement. Pursuant to a security agreement,
the loan from NDC is fully secured by cash and cash equivalents.
