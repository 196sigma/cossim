Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors
of Coventry Health Care, Inc. We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Coventry Health Care, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders
equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. Our audit also included the financial statement schedule listed
in the Index at a. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. The
financial statements and schedule of Coventry Health Care, Inc. and subsidiaries for the years ended December 31,
2001 and 2000 were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations and whose report dated February 1, 2002
expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements and schedule before the restatement disclosures described in
Note C.
We
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Coventry Health Care, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
As
discussed in Note C to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2002, Coventry Health Care,
Inc., changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets.
As
discussed above, the consolidated financial statements of Coventry Health Care, Inc. as of December 31, 2001,
and for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 ended were audited by other auditors
who have ceased operations. As described in Note C,
these consolidated financial statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which was
adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2002. Our audit procedures with respect to the disclosures in Note C with
respect to 2001 and 2000 included a agreeing the previously reported net earnings to the previously issued financial
statements and the adjustments to reported net earnings representing amortization expense recognized in those
periods related to goodwill to the Companys underlying records obtained from management, and b testing the
mathematical accuracy of the reconciliation of adjusted net earnings to reported net earnings, and the related
earnings-per-share amounts. In our opinion, the disclosures for 2001 and 2000 in
Note C are appropriate. However, we were
not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 and 2000 financial statements of the Company other than
with respect to such disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on
the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors
of Coventry Health Care, Inc. We have audited the

Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in

Significant Accounting Policies
Principles
of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are 100% owned. All significant
inter-company transactions have been eliminated. 
Use
of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
amounts. 52 Significant
Customers - The Companys commercial business is diversified across a large
customer base and there are no commercial groups that make up 10% or more of
managed care premiums. For the years ended 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company
received 123%, 114% and 158%, respectively, of its managed care premiums from
the Federal Medicare program throughout its various markets. The Company also
received 131%, 124% and 115% of its managed care premiums in 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively, from its Medicaid programs throughout its various markets.
In 2002, the State of Missouri accounted for over half of the Companys
Medicaid membership. 
Cash
and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist principally of
overnight repurchase agreements, money market funds, commercial paper and
certificates of deposit. The Company considers all highly liquid securities
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents reported in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value. 
Investments
- - The Company accounts for investments in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115 Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, issued by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB. The Company invests primarily in
debt securities and classifies all its investments as available-for-sale.
Investments are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis to determine if declines
in value are other-than-temporary. In making that determination, all available
evidence relating to the realizable value of a security is considered. 
Temporary
declines in value of investments classified as available-for-sale are netted
with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of
stockholders equity. A decline in fair value below amortized cost that is
judged to be other-than-temporary is accounted for as if it was a realized loss
and the write down is included in earnings. Realized gains and losses on the
sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. 
Investments
with original maturities in excess of three months and less than one year are
classified as short-term investments and generally consist of time deposits,
U.S. Treasury Notes and obligations of various states and municipalities.
Long-term investments have original maturities in excess of one year and
primarily consist of debt securities. 
Derivative
Instruments - In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133 Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Effective January 1,
2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133 as amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No.
138. Accordingly, a transition gain of $09 million, net of tax, was recorded
in the first quarter of 2001 related to one financial instrument classified as
derivative in nature. The adjustment is shown separately as a cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle. 
Other
Receivables Other receivables include interest receivables, reinsurance
claims receivables, receivables from providers and suppliers and any other
receivables that do not relate to premiums. 
Property
and Equipment - Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the related
assets or, if shorter, over the terms of the respective leases. 
Business
Combinations, Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangibles In June 2001,
the FASB issued two standards related to business combinations. The first
statement, SFAS No. 141 Business Combinations, requires all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using
the purchase method and prohibits the pooling-of-interest method of accounting.
SFAS No. 141 also states that acquired intangible assets should be separately
recognized upon meeting certain criteria. Such intangible assets include, but
are not limited to, trade and service marks, non-compete agreements, customer
lists and licenses. The Company was not significantly affected by the
implementation of this statement. 
The
second statement, SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, requires companies to cease amortization of goodwill. Rather,
goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives will be subject
to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value-based test. The
Company uses three approaches to identifying the fair value of its goodwill and
other intangible assets: the market approach, the market capitalization approach
and the income approach. The market approach estimates a businesss fair
value by analyzing the recent sales of similar companies. The market
capitalization approach is based on market value of the Companys total
shares outstanding. The income approach is based on the present value of
expected future cash flows. Impairment charges may result in the future
write-downs in the period in which the impairment took place. As required, the
Company adopted SFAS No. 142 for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2002, and,
accordingly, goodwill was not amortized during 2002 nor did the Company incur an
impairment charge related to goodwill. See Note C to consolidated financial
statements for disclosure related to intangible assets. 53 Long-lived
Assets - In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144 Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. This statement addresses
financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived
assets. The provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The adoption of this
statement did not have a material impact on the Companys financial
position or results of operations. 
Medical
Claims Liabilities and Expense - Medical claims liabilities consist of actual
claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but
not reported. The estimated claims incurred but not reported are based on
historical data, current enrollment, health service utilization statistics and
other related information. In determining our IBNR liabilities, we employ
standard actuarial reserve methods that are specific to each markets
membership, product characteristics, geographic territories and provider
network. We also consider utilization frequency and unit costs of inpatient,
outpatient, pharmacy and other medical expenses, as well as claim payment
backlogs and the timing of provider reimbursements The Company also establishes
reserves, if required, for the probability that anticipated future health care
costs and contract maintenance costs under the group of existing contracts will
exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those
contracts. These accruals are continually monitored and reviewed, and as
settlements are made or accruals adjusted, differences are reflected in current
operations. Changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual
experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term. 
Revenue
Recognition - Managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in
which members are entitled to service. Premiums are based on a per subscriber
contract rate and the subscribers in the Companys records at the time of
billing. Premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month preceding
the month of coverage. Premium billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect
changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations, additions, or
other changes. The Company also receives premium payments from the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS on a monthly basis for its
Medicare+Choice membership. Membership and category eligibility are periodically
reconciled with CMS and could result in adjustments to revenue. Premiums
collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. Employer contracts are
typically on an annual basis, subject to cancellation by the employer group or
by the Company upon 30 days notice. 
Based
on information received subsequent to premium billings being sent, historical
trends, bad debt write-offs and the collectibility of specific accounts, the
Company estimates, on a monthly basis, the amount of bad debt and future
retroactivity and adjusts its revenue and reserves accordingly. 
Premiums
for services to federal employee groups are subject to audit and review by the
Office of Personnel Management OPM on a periodic basis. Such
audits are usually a number of years in arrears. Any differences between actual
results and estimates are recorded in the year the audits are finalized. 
The
Company currently enters into performance guarantees primarily with non-risk
employer groups where the Company pledges that it will meet certain standards.
These standards vary widely and could involve customer service, member
satisfaction, claims processing, claims accuracy and telephone on-hold time.
Under these performance guarantees, the Company could be at risk for not
maintaining the standards held in the contracts. The risk level varies by
agreement with penalties based on a variety of calculations including per member
per month, percentage of premium, or percentage of administration fees. Risk
levels are evaluated quarterly. When standards are not met under these
performance guarantees, reserves are established. 54 Stock-based
Compensation - The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to employees
under Accounting Principles Board APB No. 25 
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and complies with the
disclosure requirements for SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation and SFAS No. 148 Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and Disclosure. The Company does not expect to
transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation,
and, accordingly, this statement did not affect the Companys financial
position or results of operations. Had compensation cost for these plans been
determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Companys net earnings and
earnings per share EPS would have been reduced to the following
pro-forma amounts in thousands, except per share data:

Income
Taxes - The Company files a consolidated federal tax return for the Company and
its subsidiaries. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS
No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. The deferred tax assets
and/or liabilities are determined by multiplying the differences between the
financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the
enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are recovered
or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date. See Note F to
consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to income taxes. 
Reclassifications
- - Certain 2001 and 2000 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2002
presentation. 55 B. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS
During
the three years ended December 31, 2002, Coventry completed several business
combinations and membership purchases. The Companys business combinations
are all accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and, accordingly,
the operating results of each acquisition have been included in the
Companys consolidated financial statements since their effective date of
acquisition. The purchase price for each business combination was allocated to
the assets, including the identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities based
on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the net
identifiable assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. Prior to December 31,
2001, goodwill was amortized over a useful life of 25 to 35 years. In accordance
with SFAS No. 142, effective January 1, 2002, the Company no longer amortizes
goodwill. The purchase price of the Companys membership purchases was
allocated to identifiable intangible assets and is being amortized over a useful
life of five to fifteen years. 
The
following table summarizes all business combinations and membership purchases
for the three years ended December 31, 2002. The purchase price, in thousands,
of each business combination includes the payment for net worth and transition
costs.

C. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill
and other intangible assets consist of costs in excess of the fair value of the
net tangible assets of subsidiaries or operations acquired through December 31,
2002. 
Goodwill
As
described in the Companys segment disclosure, assets are not allocated to
specific products, and, accordingly, goodwill can not be reported by segment.
The Company has completed its impairment tests of goodwill and has determined
that there was no impairment of goodwill as of January 1, 2002 nor as of October
1, 2002, the Companys annual revaluation date. The changes in the carrying
amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2002 were as follows in

portion of the deferred tax asset resulting from net operating loss
carryforwards associated with certain acquisitions is doubtful. G. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Stock-Based Compensation As
of December 31, 2002, the Company had one stock incentive plan, the Amended and
Restated 1998 Stock Incentive Plan the Stock Incentive Plan under
which shares of the Companys common stock were authorized for issuance to
key employees, consultants and directors in the form of stock options,
restricted stock and other stock-based awards. 
The
Stock Incentive Plan is authorized to grant either incentive stock options or
nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and
other stock-based awards at the discretion of the Compensation and Benefits
Committee of the Board of Directors. At the annual meeting of shareholders held
on June 8, 2000, the Companys shareholders voted to increase the shares of
common stock authorized for issuance under the Stock Incentive Plan from an
aggregate of seven million shares to an aggregate of nine million shares. Shares
available for issuance under the Stock Incentive Plan were 662,705 and 1,463,925
as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 
Stock Options
Under
the Stock Incentive Plan, the terms and conditions of option grants are
established on an individual basis with the exercise price of the options being
equal to not less than 100% of the market value of the underlying stock at the
date of grant. Options generally become exercisable after one year in 20% to 25%
increments per year and expire ten years from the date of grant. At December 31,
2002, the Stock Incentive Plan had outstanding options representing 3,800,523
shares of common stock. 61 Transactions

The
weighted-average grant date fair values for options granted in 2002, 2001 and
2000 were $1566, $1017 and $601, respectively. Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The
Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan, implemented in 1994, allows
substantially all employees who meet length of service requirements to set aside
a portion of their salary for the purchase of the Companys common stock.
At the end of each plan year, the Company issues the stock to participating
employees at an issue price equal to 85% of the lower of the stock price at the
end of the plan year or the average stock price, as defined. The Company has
reserved 10 million shares of stock for this plan and has issued 10,997, 9,275
and 7,883 shares in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Restricted Stock Awards
During
2002, the Company awarded 527,700 shares of restricted stock with varying
vesting periods through May 2006. The fair value of the restricted shares, at
the grant date, is amortized over the vesting period. The restricted stock
shares were granted at a weighted-average fair value of $2863. The Company
recorded compensation expense related to restricted stock grants of $57
million, $15 million and $05 million for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively. The deferred portion of the restricted stock is
$172 million at December 31, 2002. Employee Retirement Plans
As
of December 31, 2002, the Company had two defined contribution retirement plans
qualifying under the Internal Revenue Code Section 401k, the Coventry Health
Care, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan the Savings Plan and the
Mid-America Health Partners Inc. 401 k and Investment Plan the MAH
Plan. All employees of Coventry Health Care, Inc. and employees of its
subsidiaries can elect to participate in the Savings Plan. The Savings Plan
assets are held by 1 Principal Life Insurance Company, as funding agent of the
assets held under the terms of the Flexible Investment Annuity Contract with
Coventry Health Care, Inc., 2 Delaware Charter Guarantee and Trust Company, as
custodial trustee of the mutual funds and 3 Bankers Trust Company, as
custodial trustee of the Savings Plans participant loans and the Coventry
Health Care, Inc. Common Stock. 62 Under
the Savings Plan participants may defer up to 15% of their eligible
compensation, limited by the maximum compensation deferral amount permitted by
applicable law. The Company makes matching contributions in the Companys
common stock equal to 100% of the participants contribution on the first
3% of the participants eligible compensation and equal to 50% of the
participants contribution on the second 3% of the participants
eligible compensation. Participants will vest in the Companys matching

length of service with the Company and/or its subsidiaries. All costs of the
Savings Plan are funded by the Company and participants as they are incurred. 
Several
acquisitions have been completed since the adoption of the Savings Plan.
Pursuant to specific terms of each acquisitions respective merger
agreement, the surviving entity 1 became an adopting employer of the Savings
Plan, and/or 2 commenced participation in the Savings Plan following approval
by the Companys board of directors. Immediately upon participation in the
Savings Plan, all participant account balances included in the assets of the
former qualified retirement plan were rolled over into the Savings Plan and
employees were permitted to commence participation in the Savings Plan except
for participants of the former Mid-America Health Partners. All employees of the
former Mid-America Health Partners were eligible to participate in the Savings
Plan effective December 2, 2002; however their balance in the MAH Plan remained
in the MAH Plan. The MAH Plan was terminated effective December 1, 2002 and the
Plan assets will remain until the earlier of i termination of employment with
Coventry or one of its affiliates; or ii receipt of the Internal Revenue
Service determination letter approving the termination of the MAH Plan. No
contributions were made to the MAH Plan after December 1, 2002. The MAH Plan
assets are held by Fidelity Management Trust Company, as funding agent of the
assets held under the terms of the Plan and Trust. All participants in the MAH
Plan were 100% vested in employer matching contributions as of December 1, 2002.

Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
As
of December 31, 2002, the Company was the sponsor of a Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan the SERP, currently known as the Coventry Health
Care, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. Under the SERP, participants
may defer up to 15% of their base salary and up to 100% of any bonus awarded.
The Company makes matching contributions equal to 100% of the participants
contribution on the first 3% of the participants compensation and 50% of
the participants contribution on the second 3% of the participants
compensation. Participants vest in the Companys matching contributions
ratably over two years. All costs of the SERP are funded by the Company as they
are incurred. 
The
cost, principally employer matching contributions, of the Savings Plan and the
SERP charged to operations for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $54 million, $56
million and $37 million, respectively. 63 H. SENIOR NOTES
On
February 1, 2002, the Company completed a transaction to sell $1750 million
original 8125% senior notes due 2012 in a private placement. These senior notes
have since been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
proceeds from the sale of senior notes were used to purchase, from Principal
Health Care, Inc., 71 million shares of Coventry common stock and a warrant
exercisable, at that time, for 31 million shares of Coventry common stock. The
aggregate purchase price for the shares of common stock and the warrant was
$1761 million. 
Senior
notes interest expense and amortization of issuance costs for the year ended
December 31, 2002 was $134 million. Interest on the notes is payable on
February 15 and August 15 each year. During 2002, the
Company paid $77 million of interest on the notes. 
The
Senior Notes contain certain covenants, including covenants regarding incurring
additional debt, limiting dividends or other restricted payments, and
restricting transactions with affiliates, sales of assets and consolidations or
mergers. The Company has complied with all covenants under the Senior Notes. I. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Leases
The
Company operates primarily in leased facilities with original lease terms of up
to ten years with options for renewal. Through its acquisitions, the Company has
office equipment leases with terms of approximately three years. 
Total
rent expense was $152 million, $153 million and $140 million, for the years
ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Legal Proceedings
In
the normal course of business, the Company has been named as a defendant in
various legal actions such as actions seeking payments for claims denied by the
Company, medical malpractice actions and other various claims seeking monetary
damages. The claims are in various stages of proceedings and some may ultimately
be brought to trial. Incidents occurring through December 31, 2002 may result in
the assertion of additional claims. The Company carries general liability
insurance for each of the Companys operations on a claims-made basis with
varying deductibles for which the Company maintains reserves. 
As
a result of significant premium increases required by insurers to renew the
Companys professional malpractice coverage, the Company formed a captive
subsidiary, CHC Casualty Risk Retention Group, Inc. CRRG, to
provide coverage for these events. CRRG provides up to $5 million in coverage
for each event and up to $10 million in coverage for each event that is a class
action. CRRG has an aggregate policy limit of $15 million. On top of the
CRRGs per event limit of $5 million, the Company is co-insured with the
Companys commercial carrier for an additional $10 million. Each
year the Company will re-evaluate the most cost effective method for insuring
these types of claims. In the opinion of management, the outcome of these
actions should not have a material adverse effect on the Companys
financial position or results of operations. 64 Coventry
Health Care, Inc. is a defendant in the provider track in the Managed Care
Litigation filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of Florida, Miami Division, MDL No. 1334, styled in re: Humana, Inc., Charles
B. Shane, MD, et al. vs. Humana, Inc., et al. This action was filed by a
group of physicians as a class action against Coventry and twelve other
companies in the managed care field. In its fourth amended complaint, the
plaintiffs have alleged violations of the federal racketeering act, Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations RICO, conspiracy to violate
RICO and aiding and abetting a scheme to violate RICO. In addition to these RICO
claims, the complaint includes counts for breach of contract, violations of
various state prompt payment laws and equitable claims for unjust enrichment and
quantum meruit. Coventry has filed a motion to dismiss each of these claims
because they fail to state a cause of action or, in the alternative, to compel
arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provisions which exist in the
Companys physician contracts. The trial court has certified various
subclasses of physicians; however, the Company was not subject to the class
certification order because the motion to certify was filed before Coventry was
joined as a defendant. The plaintiffs are currently pursuing class discovery
against Coventry and will then file their motion for class certification as to
Coventry. The defendants who were subject to the certification order filed an
appeal to the 11th Circuit which has been granted. Although Coventry
can not predict the outcome, management believes that the claims asserted in
this lawsuit are without merit and the Company intends to defend its position. 
The
Company may be the target of other similar lawsuits involving RICO and the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, generally claiming that managed
care companies overcharge consumers and misrepresent that they deliver quality
health care. Although the Company may be the target of other similar lawsuits,
the Company believes there is no valid basis for such lawsuits. 
The
Companys industry is heavily regulated and the laws and rules governing
the industry and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent
change. Existing or future laws could have significant impact on the
Companys operations. Capitation Arrangements
A
small percentage of the Companys membership is covered by global
capitation arrangements. Under the typical arrangement, the provider receives a
fixed percentage of premium to cover all the medical costs provided to the
globally capitated members. Under some capitated arrangements, physicians may
also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive
arrangements. Global capitation agreements limit the Companys exposure to
the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose the Company to risk as to the
adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider
organization. To the extent that the respective provider organization faces
financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under
the global capitation agreements, the Company, which is responsible for the
coverage of its members pursuant to its customer agreements, will be required to
perform such obligations, and may have to incur costs in doing so in excess of
the amounts it would otherwise have to pay under the global capitation
agreements. 
Federal
Employees Health Benefits Program
The
Company contracts with the OPM to provide managed health care services under the
Federal Employee Health Benefits Program FEHBP. These contracts
with the OPM and applicable government regulations establish premium rating
arrangements for this program. The OPM conducts periodic audits of its
contractors to, among other things, verify that the premiums established under
its contracts are in compliance with the community rating and other requirements
under FEHBP. The OPM may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions
against health plans that participate in the program. 
HealthAmerica
Pennsylvania, Inc., the Companys Pennsylvania HMO subsidiary, has received
draft audit reports from the OPM that questioned approximately $311 million of
subscription charges for contract years 1993 1999 that were paid to this
subsidiary under the FEHBP. The reports recommend that if these amounts are
deemed to be due, approximately $55 million in lost investment income charges
should also be recovered with respect to such overcharges, with additional
interest continuing to accrue until repayment of the overcharged amounts. This
matter has also been referred to the Office of the U.S. Attorney for
consideration of a possible civil action. The Company has responded to the OPM
and the U.S. Attorney with respect to the amounts questioned during these audits
and has provided additional information to support its positions. Although the
Company can not predict the outcome of this matter, management believes, after
consultation with legal counsel, that the ultimate resolution of this matter
will not have a material adverse effect on the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. 65 J. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments in marketable
securities and accounts receivable. The Company invests its excess cash in
interest bearing deposits with major banks, commercial paper, municipal
obligations, mortgage backed securities and money market funds. Investments in
marketable securities are managed within guidelines established by the Board of
Directors, which emphasize investment-grade fixed income securities and limit
the amount that may be invested in any one issuer. The fair value of the
Companys financial instruments is substantially equivalent to their
carrying value and, although there is some credit risk associated with these
instruments, the Company believes this risk to be minimal. 
Concentration
of credit risk with respect to receivables is limited due to the large number of
customers comprising the Companys customer base and their breakdown among
geographical locations. The Company believes the allowance for doubtful accounts
adequately provides for estimated losses as of December 31, 2002. The Company
has a risk of incurring losses if such allowances are not adequate. K. STATUTORY INFORMATION
The
Companys HMOs, its insurance company subsidiary, CHL, and CRRG are
required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances,
thereby limiting the dividends the parent may receive from its HMOs, CHL
and CRRG. During 2002, the Company collected $367 million in dividends from its
HMO subsidiaries, CHL and CRRG. 
The
National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC has proposed
that states adopt risk-based capital RBC standards that, if
implemented, would generally require higher minimum capitalization requirements
for HMOs and other risk-bearing health care entities. RBC is a method of
measuring the minimum amount of capital deemed appropriate for a managed care
organization to support its overall business operations with consideration for
its size and risk profile. This calculation, approved by the NAIC, incorporates
asset risk, underwriting risk, credit risk and business risk components. The
Companys health plans are required to submit a RBC report to the NAIC and
their domiciled states department of insurance with their annual filing. 
The
RBC results will then be used to determine if the health plans statutory
net worth is adequate to support the amount of its calculated risk profile.
Regulators will also use the RBC results to determine if any regulatory actions
are required. Regulatory actions that could take place, if any, range from
filing a financial action plan explaining how the plan will increase its
statutory net worth to the approved levels, to the health plan being placed
under regulatory control. 
The
majority of states in which the Company operates health plans have adopted a RBC
policy that recommends the health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above
the Company Action Level which is currently equal to 200% of their
RBC 250% for CHL. Although not all states have adopted the RBC policy,
the total 200% of RBC for all of the Companys HMO subsidiaries was $2375
million at December 31, 2002. Combined statutory capital and surplus of the
Companys HMOs was $3933 million at December 31, 2002 resulting in surplus
in excess of 200% of RBC of $1558 million, up from $721 million at December
31, 2001. These statutory reserves for the Companys HMO subsidiaries, as a
percentage of RBC, was 331% and 267% as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The increase is due to income from 2002 and capital contributions
made by the parent company to HMO subsidiaries in order to comply with newly
adopted RBC policies or to prevent the impairment of the subsidiaries
statutory net worth and offset by dividends paid to the parent company. Some
states in which the Companys HMOs operate require HMOs to maintain
deposits with the respective states departments of insurance. These
deposits totaled $139 million at December 31, 2002 and are included as part of
cash and cash equivalents and investments. 66 For
CHL, 250% of risk-based capital was $168 million at December 31, 2002.
Total adjusted statutory capital and surplus of CHL was $409 million,
resulting in surplus in excess of 250% of RBC of $241 million, up from $34
million at December 31, 2001. The total statutory reserve for CHL, as a
percentage of RBC, was 609% and 283% as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The increase is primarily due to income from 2002. Statutory
deposits for CHL as of December 31, 2002 totaled approximately $39
million. 
For
CRRG, 200% of risk-based capital was $18 million at December 31, 2002. Total
adjusted statutory capital and surplus of CRRG was $30 million, resulting in
excess of 200% of RBC of $12 million. The Company made a capital contribution
of $30 million to CRRG during 2002. L. OTHER INCOME
Other
income for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 includes investment
income, net of fees, of approximately $409 million, $432 million and $412
million, respectively. M. AHERF CHARGE
As
a consequence of the bankruptcy filed by Allegheny Health, Education and
Research Foundation AHERF on July 21, 1998, the Company and
certain affiliated hospitals of AHERF were involved in litigation to determine
if the Company had the financial responsibility for medical services provided to
the Companys members by the hospitals. As a result of the bankruptcy,
AHERF failed to pay for medical services under its global capitation agreement
with the Company covering approximately 250,000 Company members in the western
Pennsylvania market. The Company, which is ultimately responsible for the
medical costs of the capitated members, therefore recorded a charge of $550
million in the second quarter of 1998. 
On
July 22, 1999, the Company reached a settlement with the hospitals whereby the
hospitals agreed that the Company would not be liable for the payment of certain
medical services rendered by the hospitals to the Companys members prior
to July 21, 1998, the date of AHERFs bankruptcy filing. 
As
a result of this settlement and the quantification of remaining medical
obligations, the Company released $63 million of medical claims liabilities
from its AHERF reserve, which was reflected as a gain in the fourth quarter and
year-end 1999 results. 
Subsequently,
during the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company was notified that it would be
receiving a distribution from the AHERF bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, the
Company was in the final stages of renegotiating most of its AHERF related lease
obligations. These events necessitated a re-estimation of the Companys
remaining lease liabilities. This re-estimation resulted in an additional
release from the Companys AHERF reserve of $43 million. This release and
an estimation of the bankruptcy proceeds of $41 million was reflected as a gain
in the 2000 results. 
The
balance of the AHERF reserve at December 31, 2002 was $28 million and
represents the Companys remaining obligations under the settlement e.g.
vacant office leases and will be expended through August 2007. N. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic
earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share assume the exercise of
all options and warrants and the vesting of all restricted stock using the
treasury stock method. 67 The

O. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
On
December 20, 1999, the Company announced a program to purchase up to 5% of its
outstanding common stock. In August 2002, the Companys Board of Directors
approved the repurchase of up to an additional 5% of the Companys
outstanding common stock. Stock repurchases may be made from time to time at
prevailing prices on the open market, by block purchase or in private
transactions. As a part of this program, the Company purchased 22 million
shares of the Companys common stock in 2002 at an aggregate cost of $655
million. The total remaining common shares the Company is authorized to
repurchase under the program, including the new authorization, is approximately
25 million as of December 31, 2002. P. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The
Company has three reportable segments: Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid
products. The products are provided to a cross section of employer groups and
individuals throughout the Companys health plans. Commercial products
include HMO, PPO and POS products. HMO products provide comprehensive health
care benefits to members through a primary care physician. PPO and POS products
permit members to participate in managed care but allow them the flexibility to
utilize out-of-network providers in exchange for increased out-of-pocket costs.
The Company provides comprehensive health benefits to members participating in
Medicare and Medicaid programs and receives premium payments from federal and
state governments. 68 The
Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments and allocates
resources based on gross margin. Assets are not allocated to specific products
and, accordingly, can not be reported by segment. The following tables summarize
the Companys reportable segments through gross margin and include a

As a result of adopting SFAS No. 133, the Company recorded a gain of $09 million, net of tax, in the first
quarter of 2001 related to one financial instrument classified as derivative in nature. The gain was shown
separately as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. R. SUBSEQUENT EVENT UNAUDITED
On
February 3, 2003, the Company completed its acquisition of PersonalCare Health
Management, Inc. PersonalCare, in Champaign, Illinois. The
acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and,
accordingly, the operating results of PersonalCare will be included in the
Companys consolidated financial statements. The purchase price for
PersonalCare was allocated to the assets, including identifiable intangible
assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. PersonalCare had
approximately 78,000 commercial members in the Central and Southern Illinois
regions.
