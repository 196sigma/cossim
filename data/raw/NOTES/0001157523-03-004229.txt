principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in
our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein
when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Distribution Date. U.S. Office Products and the Company entered into a number
of agreements to facilitate the Distribution and the transition of the Company
to an independent business enterprise.
Workflow is one of the largest distributors of printed business products
in North America and is also a leading provider of end-to-end business
management outsourcing solutions, which include vendor-neutral custom print
sourcing, consulting and integrated storage and distribution services, that
allow its customers to control all of their print related costs. The Company
produces and distributes a full range of printed business products and provides
related management services to approximately 31,000 customers in North America
ranging in size from small businesses to Fortune 100 companies. The Company
provides customers with an integrated set of services and information tools that
reduces the costs of procuring, storing, distributing and using printed business
products and produces custom business documents, envelopes, direct mail and
commercial printing. Workflow employs approximately 2,900 persons and has 89
facilities and utilizes approximately 650,000 square feet for manufacturing,
574,000 square feet for distribution, 523,000 square feet for warehousing,
78,000 square feet for print-on-demand and 427,000 square feet for sales and
administrative offices throughout North America. NOTE 2--LIQUIDITY    On August 1, 2003, the Company amended its credit facility the Amended
Restructured Credit Facility which deferred repayment of the $50,000 Term Loan
B portion of the Amended Restructured Credit Facility from December 31, 2003 to
May 1, 2004 see Note 18--Subsequent Events. The Company is currently
pursuing various strategic and refinancing alternatives that would allow it to
repay Term Loan B by May 1, 2004. However, the Company does not have any written
agreements or firm commitments with respect to any potential refinancing or
similar transactions, nor does the Company anticipate generating operating cash
flows that would allow it to repay this obligation directly. There can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to repay Term Loan B by its due date. In
the event that the Company is unable to do so, it will be in default with its
lenders under the Amended Restructured Credit Facility. Any such default likely
would have a material adverse effect on the Company business, financial
condition and results of operations and lenders' remedies upon such default
would include the right to foreclose on the Company assets. NOTE 3--BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes to
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Workflow, including
companies acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase
method from their respective dates of acquisition. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant
estimates include allowance for doubtful account and inventory reserves,
impairment of property and equipment, impairment of goodwill and realization of
deferred tax assets. Definition of Fiscal Year
As used in these consolidated financial statements and related notes to
consolidated financial statements, Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001,
Fiscal 2000 and Fiscal 1999 refer to the Company fiscal years ended April
30, 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000 and April 24, 1999, respectively.                    F-7               WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Dollars In Thousands, Except Per Share Data Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made in the Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal
2001 financial statements to conform to the Fiscal 2003 presentation. Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers temporary cash investments with original maturities
of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable.
Receivables arising from sales to customers are not collateralized and, as a
result, management continually monitors the financial condition of its customers
to reduce the risk of loss. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful
accounts, which is reviewed at least quarterly for estimated losses resulting
from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Additional
allowances may be necessary in the future if the ability of its customers to pay
deteriorates. The Company five largest customers accounted for 105%, 90% and
84% of the Company revenues for Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001,
respectively. The Company single largest customer accounted for 47%, 37% and
23% of revenues for Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, respectively. Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined
on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis and consist primarily of products held for
sale. Inventory manufactured by the Company includes the cost of materials,
labor and manufacturing overhead. The Company maintains a reserve for slow
moving or obsolete inventory, which is reviewed at least quarterly, based upon
usage and inventory age to determine its adequacy. Physical inventories are
taken throughout each fiscal year. Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost. Additions and improvements are
capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation of
property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The estimated useful lives
range from 25 to 40 years for buildings and their components and 3 to 15 years
for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Property and equipment leased under
capital leases is amortized over the lesser of its useful life or its lease
terms. Gains and losses on the disposition of property and equipment are
computed based upon the difference between the sales proceeds received and the
net book value of the fixed asset at the date of the disposal. Property and
equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the assets, or the
appropriate grouping of assets, is compared with the carrying value to determine
whether an impairment exists, pursuant to the provisions of State of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets beginning in Fiscal 2003.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
During Fiscal 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, was issued. Workflow adopted this
new standard and as a result, the Company ceased to amortize goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets effective May 1, 2001. The Company continues
to amortize definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives
ranging from one to five years. In lieu of goodwill amortization Workflow
performed an initial impairment review of its goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets as of the implementation date, following which the Company
concluded that there was no impairment at May 1, 2001. An impairment is recorded
when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the
reporting unit net assets. Fair value of a reporting unit is derived from a
combination of discounted cash flows and comparison to comparable publicly
traded companies.                    F-8               WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Dollars In Thousands, Except Per Share Data Earn-Out Agreements
Several of the acquisition agreements for the Company business
combinations accounted for under the purchase method of accounting include
earn-out provisions that could result in additional purchase consideration
payable in the form of cash payments in subsequent periods dependent upon
specific future operating performance criteria. The Company records additional
purchase consideration under these earn-out provisions in accordance with SFAS
No. 141, Business Combinations. As such, when the outcome of the contingency
under the earn-out is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt, the Company
records the expected earn-out payment as goodwill and accrues the earn-out as an
accrued liability on the Company balance sheet. Translation of Foreign Currencies
The financial statements include the results of the Company Canadian
operations which are translated from Canadian dollars, their functional
currency, into U.S. dollars. Balance sheet accounts of foreign subsidiaries are
translated using the year-end exchange rate and the statement of operations
accounts are translated using the average prevailing exchange rate during the
year. Translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders' equity as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Foreign currency
transaction gains and losses are recorded in income when realized. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Company financial instruments including cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair
value. The face amounts of the Company credit facility, subordinated debt and
other long-term debt, approximate their fair values. Income Taxes
The Company provides for deferred taxes on temporary differences arising
from assets and liabilities whose bases are different for financial reporting
and state, federal and foreign income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is
recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a
tax benefit will not be realized. The primary factors considered are historical
results, earnings potential determined through use of internal projections and
the nature of income that can be used to realize the deferred tax asset. Based
on a consideration of these factors, the Company believes it is more likely than
not all of our deferred tax assets will be realized. If future results of
operations are less than expected future assessments may result in a
determination that some or all of the net deferred tax assets are not
realizable. Taxes on Undistributed Earnings
In Fiscal 2003, provision is made for U.S. income taxes on accumulated
earnings of Canadian subsidiary. In connection with obtaining the Company
Restructured Credit Facility in Fiscal 2003, the Company pledged shares of the
Canadian subsidiary. Although no cash distribution was made, the pledge
triggered inclusion of the Canadian subsidiary accumulated earnings which are
reported as dividend income for U.S. tax purposes. As the Company will report a
consolidated taxable loss on its Fiscal 2003 U.S. income tax return, it cannot
recognize a corresponding financial statement benefit for foreign tax credits
associated with the Canadian inclusion.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue for the majority of its products upon
shipment to the customer, upon the transfer of title and when risk of loss
passes to the buyer. Under agreements with certain customers, custom forms may
be stored by the Company for future delivery. In these situations, the Company
typically receives a warehousing fee for the services it provides. In these
cases, delivery and billing schedules are agreed upon with the customer and
revenue is recognized when manufacturing is complete, title transfers to the
customer, the order is invoiced and there is reasonable assurance as to
collectibility. Since the majority of products are customized, produce returns
are not significant. The Company recognizes revenues for warehousing customers'
inventory as storage services are provided. The Company does not charge separate
fees for on-line access and ordering of inventory as these services are offered
to customers as a convenience. Delivery costs billed to customers are recognized
in revenues. Revenues recognized for services were $19,347, $13,807 and $9,588
for Fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.                    F-9               WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Dollars In Thousands, Except Per Share Data Cost of Revenues
Vendor rebates are recognized on an accrual basis in the period earned and
are recorded as a reduction to cost of revenues. All delivery and warehouse
occupancy costs are included in cost of revenues. Advertising Costs
The Company expenses advertising costs when the advertisement occurs.
Advertising costs are included in the consolidated statement of operations as a
component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising expense
for Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001 was $85, $186 and $540,
respectively. Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs are charged to operations in the year
incurred. Research and development costs are included in the consolidated
statement of operations as a component of selling, general and administrative
expenses. Internally Developed Software
Internal costs related to internally developed software such as internal
salaries and supplies are expensed as incurred as a component of selling,
general and administrative expenses until the internally developed software
reaches its technological feasibility. External costs related to internally
developed software, such as outside programmers and consultants, are capitalized
as property and equipment and expensed over the expected useful life of the
software, normally three to five years. During Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and
Fiscal 2001, the Company capitalized $628, $1,391 and $621, respectively, in
internal salaries and outside consulting fees for internally developed software. Restructuring Costs
For exit and disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002, the
Company recognizes the costs associated with such an activity when a liability
is incurred and its fair value can be estimated. For exit and disposal
activities initiated prior to January 1, 2003, liability for an exit cost is
recognized at the date of the Company commitment to an exit plan. Deferred pension benefit
The cost of pensions and other retirement benefits earned by employees
covered by the defined benefit pension plans is determined using the projected
benefit method pro-rated on service and management best estimate of expected
plan investment performance, salary escalation and retirement ages of employees.
The discount rate used to determine the accrued benefit obligation is determined
by reference to market interest rates. For the purpose of calculating the
expected return on plan assets, those assets are valued at fair market value.
Adjustments arising from changes in pension benefits and assumptions and
experience gains and losses above 10% of lower of the accrued benefit obligation
and plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining service lives
of the employees.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Dollars In Thousands, Except Per Share Data New Accounting Pronouncements
Extinguishment of Debt and Accounting for Leases. In April 2002, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment
of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections, that supercedes previous
guidance for the reporting of gains and losses from extinguishment of debt and
accounting for leases, among other things.
SFAS No. 145 requires that only gains and losses from the extinguishment
of debt that meet the requirements for classification as Extraordinary Items,
as prescribed in APB No. 30, should be disclosed as such in the financial
statements. Previous guidance required all gains and losses from the
extinguishment of debt to be classified as Extraordinary Items. This portion
of SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002, with
restatement of prior periods required. Implementation of this portion of the
standard will result in the reclassification of certain losses on extinguishment
of debt previously treated as extraordinary items by Workflow.
In addition, SFAS No. 145 amends SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, as
it relates to accounting by a lessee for certain lease modifications. Under SFAS
No. 13, if a capital lease is modified in such a way that the change gives rise
to a new agreement classified as an operating lease, the assets and obligation
are removed, a gain or loss is recognized and the new lease is accounted for as
an operating lease. Under SFAS No. 145, capital leases that are modified so the
resulting lease agreement is classified as an operating lease are to be
accounted for under he sale-leaseback provisions of SFAS No. 98, Accounting or
Leases. These provisions of SFAS No. 145 are effective for transactions
occurring after May 15, 2002.
SFAS No. 145 will be applied as required. Adoption of SFAS No. 145 is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.
Accounting for Exit and Disposal Activities. In June 2002, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
which addresses the recognition, measurement, and reporting of costs associated
with exit and disposal activities, including restructuring activities. This
statement requires that liabilities for costs associated with an exit or
disposal activity not be recognized until the liability is incurred and the fair
value can be estimated, except for certain one-time termination benefits. SFAS
No. 146 nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 94-3 which permitted
recognition of a liability for such costs at the date of a company commitment
to an exit plan. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 are effective, and we have
adopted its provisions, for exit and disposal activities initiated after
December 31, 2002. The provisions of EITF 94-3 will continue to apply for
liabilities previously recorded.
Accounting for Consideration Received from a Vendor. In January 2003,
the Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF 02-16, Accounting by a Customer
Including a Reseller for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, which
states that cash consideration received from a vendor is presumed to be a
reduction of the prices of the vendor products or services and should,
therefore, be characterized as a reduction of cost of goods sold when recognized
in the statement of operations. That presumption is overcome when the
consideration is either a reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable
costs incurred to the sell the vendor products, or a payment for assets or
services delivered to the vendor. EITF 02-16 is effective, and we have adopted
it provisions, for arrangements entered into after December 31, 2002.
Guarantor Accounting for Guarantees. In December 2002, the FASB
issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others, which provides for additional disclosures to be made by a guarantor in
its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations and requires,
under certain circumstances, a guarantor to recognize, at the inception of a
guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in
issuing the guarantee. We have adopted the disclosure requirements for Fiscal
2003 and do not expect the recognition and measurement provisions of
Interpretation No. 45 to have an effect on our consolidated financial
statements.

During Fiscal 2003 the Company made no acquisitions. Fiscal 2002 and
Fiscal 2001, the Company made two and eight acquisitions, respectively,
accounted for under the purchase method the Purchased Companies. These
acquisitions were made in order to expand the Company presence in the
marketplace in which it serves. The results of these acquisitions have been
included in the Company results from their respective dates of acquisition.
Initial cash consideration and subsequent acquisition costs paid associated with
the acquisition of the Purchased Companies totaled $8,537, $17,494 and $29,989
during Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, respectively. The total assets
acquired with the Purchased Companies during Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal
2001, were $8,537, $18,078 and $39,431, respectively, including intangible
assets of $8,537, $16,464 and $20,282, respectively.
The majority of the Purchased Companies have earn-out provisions that
could result in additional purchase consideration payable in subsequent periods,
ranging from three to five years, dependent upon the future earnings of these
acquired companies. During Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, $7,659 9,451 and $6,614, respectively, of additional purchase consideration was paid
by the Company in connection with earn-out provisions and another $7,677 has
been accrued for these earn-out provisions at April 30, 2003. The additional
consideration, whether paid or accrued, has been reflected in the accompanying
balance sheet as goodwill at April 30, 2003.

Dollars In Thousands, Except Per Share Data NOTE 5--RESTRUCTURING COSTS
The Company historically has grown significantly through acquisitions.
However, the Company began to implement a new strategic business plan in Fiscal
2003. Under its new strategic plan, the Company has focused on i integrating
its existing core operations to improve profitability and ii divesting
non-core operations to pay down debt. The Company did not consummate any
acquisitions in Fiscal 2003 and does not anticipate pursuing or consummating
acquisitions in the near future.
During Fiscal 2003, the Company reversed into income a $1,242
restructuring charge taken in the three months ended April 30, 2001 that is no
longer required since the Company recently settled the underlying contract
dispute and expensed $4,668 in strategic restructuring costs associated with the
exploration of other financial, restructuring and strategic alternatives.
During Fiscal 2001, the Company incurred expenses of $8,092 in connection
with its' reorganization and integration plan. Under this restructuring plan,
the Company streamlined its operations by eliminating duplicate facilities and
employee functions and reducing corporate overhead. The Company paid $608 1,131 and $681 for severance and utilized an additional $2,186, $1,682 and
$4,025 for facility closures and asset write-downs, including software,
furniture and fixtures, associated with this plan in Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002
and Fiscal 2001, respectively.
Under the restructuring plans implemented during Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2001
and Fiscal 2000, the Company terminated and provided severance benefits to 37,
100 and 39 employees respectively. However, certain severed employees have
delayed severance payments. The majority of the workforce reductions were within
the production area and backroom functions such as accounting, human resources
and administration.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Dollars In Thousands, Except Per Share Data    In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations and
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires that
business combinations initiated subsequent to June 30, 2001, must be accounted
for by using the purchase method of accounting. SFAS No. 142 supersedes
Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 17, Intangible Assets,
however, the new statement carries forward provisions in APB Opinion No. 17
related to internally developed intangible assets. SFAS No. 142 requires that
the Company discontinue the amortization of goodwill. Early adoption of SFAS No.
142 is allowed for those companies with fiscal years beginning after March 15,
2001. The Company adopted and applied SFAS No. 142 as of May 1, 2001, the
beginning of Fiscal 2002.
SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be
assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques. Specifically,
goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first step of
the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by
comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value, including
goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount,
goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of
the goodwill impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of the
reporting unit goodwill exceeds its fair value, the second step of the
goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss,
if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied
fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that
goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the
implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an
amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in
the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.
That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets
and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as
if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair
value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting
unit. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an
impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Based upon a
valuation analysis performed by Standard and Poor during Fiscal 2003 and due
to sustained, significant deterioration in operating results, the fair value of
the direct mail and commercial print operations in southern California was
determined to be less than its then carrying value at April 30, 2003. In
arriving at a conclusion regarding fair values, a combination of discounted cash
flows and a comparison of the Company to comparable publicly traded companies
was utilized. Based upon the SFAS No. 142 step one and step two analyses, the
Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $17,996 as a component of
operating income during Fiscal 2003.                    F-16               WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT, INC.

NOTE 9 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Consistent with the Company business plan and long-term strategic
objectives, the Company Board of Directors adopted a plan to sell certain
non-core operations. The Company sold the non-core operations subsequent to
April 30, 2003, see Note 18 - Subsequent Events. The Company net realizable
value for these non-core operations is approximately $5,000. Accordingly, the
net assets of the subsidiaries have been written down to a fair value of $5,000.
The $16,210 write-down for discontinued operations was comprised exclusively of
a write-down in long-term assets held for sale. Current assets, specifically
accounts receivable and inventories, were not impaired and had been recorded at
their net realizable value in periods prior to the adoption of the Company
current business plan. The majority of the long-term asset write-down
represented a goodwill impairment. Before the business plan was adopted,
management believed that projected cash flows were sufficient to recover these
written-down assets. These projected cash flows assumed that the Company would
integrate these operations with other Company operations and enhance
profitability by making significant operational improvements. However, with the
adoption of the current strategic business plan and the desire of the Company
and its lenders to sell operations in order to pay down the Company bank debt,
the profit improvement plans will only be partially implemented prior to the
operations' disposal. In addition, prior to adoption of the current business
plan it was not anticipated that the Company would be required by its lenders to
dispose of certain operations prior to the profit improvement and integration
initiatives described above. Pursuant to SFAS No. 144, the operations to be sold
have been treated as discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for
sale as of April 30, 2003.
Summarized below are the results of operations for the years ended April 30,
2003, 2002 and 2001.                                    Fiscal

Long-Term Debt    On January 15, 2003, the Company entered into a restructured senior
secured credit facility with its lenders the Restructured Credit Facility
totaling approximately $180,000 and comprised of three separate tranches. The
tranches of debt under the Amended Restructured Credit Facility consist of: i
an approximately $100,000 asset based revolving credit facility the Revolver
which provides access to working capital advanced on a borrowing base formula;
ii an approximately $30,000 senior term loan the Term Loan A which
amortizes in scheduled increments semi-annually starting on June 30, 2003; and
iii a $500 million senior term loan the Term Loan B. The Revolver and
Term Loan A mature on June 30, 2005. Term Loan B matures on December 31, 2003.
The Revolver contains advance rates of 80% of the Company eligible accounts
receivable, 50% of the Company eligible inventories and $10,000 against the
Company fixed assets. At April 30, 2003, the blended annual interest rate on
the Restructured Credit Facility was approximately 90%. During the year ended
April 30, 2003, the Company incurred $18,752 in interest expense relating to its
previous credit facility and the Restructured Credit Facility. The outstanding balances in millions on the Restructured Credit Facility at
April 30, 2003 were as follows                     Maximum        Amount     Applicable

$   173,000     $   165,100
Including $3,069 in outstanding letters of credit, the Company
availability under the Restructured Credit Facility at April 30, 2003 was
$4,831. As of April 30, 2003, we had $165,107 outstanding on the Restructured
Credit Facility in addition to $3,069 in outstanding letters of credit.     The Restructured Credit Facility also contains provisions requiring the
Company to issue warrants to its lenders for the purchase of up to one million
shares of the Company common stock in the event the Company defaults on its
repayment obligations. These contingent warrants have an estimated value of $213
and have been recorded as a component of equity with an offsetting reduction in
the carrying value of the debt. No additional accounting recognition is expected
to occur as it relates to the issuance of the warrants. However, the remaining
carrying value of the debt will be accreted to par over its remaining term, with
such accretion being reported as interest expense. The Company considered the
guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force EITF No. 00-19, Accounting for
Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a
Company Own Stock and EITF 01-6, The Meaning of `Indexed to a Company Own
Stock' in concluding that the warrants should be recognized at fair value and
reported as equity at the time of the contractual agreement because the warrants
are indexed to, and will be settled in the Company own stock.     Under the terms of the Restructured Credit Facility, the Company is
required to defer or otherwise not pay at least $4,000 of earn-outs due in May
2003. Recipients of approximately $1,000 of earn-out payments voluntarily agreed
to accept subordinated notes due in 2005 in lieu of receiving a cash earn-out
payment in May. However, many earn-out recipients were not willing to accept
F-19               WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Dollars In Thousands, Except Per Share Data
these notes. As a result, to remain in compliance with its credit facility, the
Company was required to breach its earn-out obligations, or in one case deliver
a short term promissory note, with respect to individuals entitled to
approximately $3,000 in earn-out payments. Following these earn-out breaches,
various earn-out recipients initiated three separate legal actions against the
Company. The Company also believes that the earn-out breaches have had an
adverse effect on the morale and productivity of some of its most important
employees.
The Company had exceeded certain covenants in the Restructured Credit
Facility at April 30, 2003 that limited capital expenditures and the incurrence
of restructuring costs. The Company amended its Restructured Credit Facility
subsequent to April 30, 2003 including obtaining waivers for the debt covenant
violations, see Note 18 - Subsequent Events.    Long-Term debt consists of the following                                                April 30,

Letters of Credit
In addition, the Company also had outstanding letters of credit of
approximately $3,069 related to performance and payment guarantees. The letters
of credit expire over varying periods through May 2004. Based upon the Company
experience with these arrangements, the Company does not believe that any
obligations that may arise will be significant. Interest Rate Swap
The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
trading purposes. On May 3, 2001, the Company entered into an interest rate swap
agreement the Swap with various lending institutions at no initial cost to
the Company with an effective date of August 1, 2001 and an expiration date of
March 10, 2004. The Company exchanged its variable interest rate on $100,000 in
Credit Facility debt for a fixed LIBOR of approximately 510% plus the Company
interest rate spread under its prior credit facility. The Swap was entered into
to manage interest rate risk on the variable rate borrowings under the Company
revolving credit portion of its debt. This interest rate swap has the effect of
locking in, for a specified period, the base interest rate the Company will pay
on the $100,000 notional principal amount established in the Swap. As a result,
while this hedging arrangement is structured to reduce the Company exposure to
increases in interest rates, it also limits the benefit the Company might
otherwise have received from any decreases in interest rates.
The Company accounted for the Swap under the guidelines of SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Effective May 1,
2001, the Company implemented SFAS No. 133 as amended. This standard required
companies to record all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the
balance sheet, measured at fair value. The recognition of gains or losses
resulting from changes in the values of those derivative instruments is based on
the use of each derivative instrument and whether it qualifies for hedge
accounting. The key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging
relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair
value or cash flows. Under the guidelines of SFAS No. 133, the Company
originally classified the Swap as a cash flow hedge. However, on July 16, 2002,
the Company prior credit facility was amended so that borrowings under the
credit facility bore a non-LIBOR based fixed interest rate. Thus, under SFAS No.
133 as amended, the Swap underlying this debt became ineffective and could no
longer be designated as a cash flow hedge of variable rate debt. This
ineffective Swap is cash settled quarterly dependent upon the movement of
3-month LIBOR rates. In measuring the fair value of the Swap at April 30, 2003,
the Company recorded a short-term liability of $4,263. During Fiscal 2003, the
Company paid $3,347 representing cash settlement payments on the Swap. Prior to
the Swap becoming ineffective, the Company recorded $817 as interest expense
during the three months ended July 31, 2002. The Company expensed an additional
$5,990 as loss on ineffective interest rate hedge for Fiscal 2003, for the
change in the prevailing LIBOR rate compared to the fixed rate under the Swap
agreement.                    F-21               WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT, INC.

per share because they were anti-dilutive. Options to purchase 4,024, 4,613 and
4,556 shares of common stock were anti-dilutive and outstanding during Fiscal
2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, respectively.
The Company also granted warrants to its senior lenders under the

included in the computation of diluted loss per share because the strike price
was not yet determinable at April 30, 2003. See further discussion under Note

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Dollars In Thousands, Except Per Share Data Notes Receivable for Stock Loans
During Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 1999, the Company extended loans to
certain members of management and the Board of Directors the Director and
Officer Notes for the purchase, in the open market, of the Company common
stock by those individuals. The Director and Officer Notes were full recourse
promissory notes bearing interest at 675% and 80% per annum, respectively,
with principal and interest payable at maturity on January 2, 2003 and February
3, 2003. During the year ended April 30, 2003, the Company collected $4,502 in
principal and $769 in interest as payments on the Director and Officer Notes and
charged $681 for uncollectible notes. At April 30, 2003, $53 net of a $270
reserve established for uncollectible notes was outstanding on the Director and
Officer notes. The Company is actively pursuing all legal remedies available to
facilitate collection of outstanding amounts. Employee Stock Plans
Prior to the Distribution, certain employees of the Company participated
in the U.S. Office Products 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan USOP Plan covering
employees of U.S. Office Products. Upon the Distribution, the Company replaced
the options to purchase shares of U.S. Office Products common stock held by its
employees with options to purchase shares of common stock of the Company. In
order to keep the Company employees that were option holders in the USOP Plan in
the same economic position immediately before and after the Distribution, the
number of U.S. Office Products' options held by Company personnel was multiplied
by 1556 and the exercise price of those options was divided by 1556 for
purposes of the replacement options. The vesting provisions and option period of
the original grants were not changed.
U.S. Office Products, as the sole stockholder of the Company prior to the
Distribution, approved the provisions of the Company 1998 Stock Incentive Plan
the Plan that permit issuance of up to 300% of the outstanding shares of
the Company common stock immediately following the Distribution, which equals
4,393 shares, including the issuance of 600 shares of incentive stock options
as that term is defined in the Internal Revenue Code, the options granted to
Jonathan J. Ledecky, Thomas B. D'Agostino, Sr., executive officers and
non-employee directors described below. All employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries, as well as non-employee directors and consultants of the Company,
are eligible for awards under the Plan. Non-qualified stock options and
incentive stock options granted to employees generally are exercisable beginning
one year from the date of grant in cumulative yearly amounts for periods ranging
from one to four years and generally expire ten years from the date of the
grant. The Company Board of Directors adopted the Plan prior to the
Distribution. As of April 30, 2003, 262 shares have been issued under the Plan.                    F-26              WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT, INC.

Under a service agreement entered into with Jonathan J. Ledecky, the Board
of Directors of U.S. Office Products the USOP Board agreed that Mr. Ledecky
would receive from the Company a stock option for the Company Common Stock as
of the date of the Distribution. The USOP Board intended the option to be
compensation for Mr. Ledecky services as an employee of the Company. The
option was to cover 75% of the outstanding Company Common Stock determined as
of the date of the Distribution, with no anti-dilution provisions in the event
of issuance of additional shares of common stock other than with respect to
stock splits or reverse stock splits. The total number of options issued to Mr.
Ledecky in connection with this grant was 1,097 options with an exercise price
equal to the closing sale price of the Company Common Stock on Nasdaq on the
first day of post-Distribution trading, June 10, 1998 the date of grant, which
was $900 per share. These options vested immediately and became exercisable on

NOTE 16--SEGMENT REPORTING
The long-term strategic business plan adopted during fiscal the year ended
April 30, 2003 views the Company as a single reporting entity in the printing
business. Consistent with this view, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer began assessing performance and allocating resources based on
the Company consolidated results and financial position. Accordingly, the
Company ceased reporting segment information for its operations formerly known
as the Printing and Solutions divisions for Fiscal 2003.
The Company transacts business in the United States, Canada and Puerto
Rico. The Company does not allocate corporate overhead by segment in assessing
performance. Corporate expenses and overhead included within the operating
income of the United States operations totaled $13,330, $6,477, and $13,695 for
Fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

exchange for $1,550. Cortez provides logistics and technical services to various
governmental agencies. F. Craig Wilson, a Director of the Company, is President,
Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors of Cortez. The
investment was accounted for under the equity method of accounting. On January

exchange for a note receivable in the amount of $1,789. The note bore simple
interest at 18% per annum with a maturity date of December 31, 2005. The note
was a full recourse note and was secured by the shares of stock sold to F. Craig
Wilson. Interest payments of 9% of the principal amount were payable quarterly
with the remaining principal and interest due at maturity. The Company recorded
a gain on the sale of the investment of $200 as other income during Fiscal 2001.
On December 20, 2001, Workflow sold this promissory note to a third party in

Lease for Company Corporate Headquarters
On January 8, 1999, the Company entered into a lease, with a purchase
option, for corporate office space in a building partially owned by an entity
beneficially owned by Thomas D'Agostino, Jr., a former executive officer of the
Company and his brother. Thomas D'Agostino, Sr., former Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer, provided short-term bridge financing for the purchase
of the property. The terms and conditions of the ten-year lease were based on
the market value of the office space. In connection with such lease, the Company
entered into an agreement with the landlord lender, Bank of America, N.A., and
the landlord, pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase the building in
the event the landlord defaulted on its financing arrangement with the lender.
During Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, the Company paid $123 and $370,
respectively, in lease payments for this facility. In addition, the Company
incurred $1,889 for leasehold improvements. Under the restructuring plan
implemented in Fiscal 2001, the Company relocated its corporate headquarters to
a smaller facility in Palm Beach during September 2001. The landlord agreed to
reimburse the Company for tenant improvements made to the premises in the
aggregate amount of $1,200, $500 of which was remitted upon termination of the
lease and the remainder of which is being disbursed in increments of $70
annually through September 2011. In connection with the lease termination, the
Company agreed to remit a broker fee of $300 to the broker responsible for
locating the replacement tenant.

Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000, the Company issued 37 and 5 warrants, respectively,
which were exercisable into shares of Company Common Stock at a nominal cost.
The subordinated notes were repaid and terminated during Fiscal 2001. The
write-off of $111 $64 net of taxes of debt issue costs in connection with debt
extinguishment was treated as an extraordinary item. During Fiscal 2003, warrant
holders exercised 11 warrants for Company Common Stock. At April 30, 2003, the
Company had 31 warrants outstanding and exercisable. Related Party Loan

third parties. In September 2000, the Company purchased all of the outstanding
equity of this entity from the former Company executives for $2,500, and
subsequently sold to unrelated third parties the two properties that were

NOTE 18--SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Resignation of Chairman of the Board
On July 19, 2003, Thomas B. D'Agostino, Sr., the Chairman of the Board of
Directors, resigned from the Board and as Chairman, and released the Company
from any obligation to pay severance or other amounts under his employment
agreement with the Company. At April 30, 2003, the Company had approximately
$2,600 accrued for obligations under Mr. D'Agostino agreement. Based on the
results of an investigation conducted by the Audit Committee of the Board with
the assistance of forensic auditors and special counsel, the Company Audit
Committee determined that Mr. D'Agostino failed to comply with Company policies
and procedures, including those relating to expenses and personal business
activities, that Mr. D'Agostino failed to furnish complete information to the
Board regarding certain transactions, and that Mr. D'Agostino should reimburse
the Company for certain expenses paid by the Company. On July 21, 2003, while
not admitting to any wrongdoing, Mr. D'Agostino paid $400 to the Company in
settlement of these matters. The results of the Audit Committee investigation
did not reveal any matters that would have a material impact on the financial
statements of the Company for any prior historical period. Following Mr.
D'Agostino resignation, the Board elected Gerald F. Mahoney as the Chairman of
the Board. Sale of Discontinued Operations
Effective July 31, 2003, the Company completed the divestiture of certain
non-core print manufacturing operations. The assets and liabilities of the
divested businesses, which have been excluded from the Company historical
operating results and classified as discontinued operations at April 30, 2003,
were sold to a financial buyer for $5,000 in gross proceeds. After payment of
expenses, the transaction generated net cash proceeds of approximately $4,900.
The Company used these net proceeds to make certain earn-out payments that were
due in May 2003 under purchase agreements for prior acquisitions and to reduce
outstanding indebtedness with its senior lenders. With the divestiture, Workflow
exited the print manufacturing of various types of specialty packaging, folding
boxes and vinyl, flexographic and silkscreen labels and signs. See further
discussion of discontinued operations under Note 9 - Discontinued Operations. Credit Facility Amendment
On August 1, 2003, the Company entered into the Amended Restructured
Credit Facility with its senior lenders. Under the terms of the Amended
Restructured Credit Facility, Term Loan B, originally due on December 31, 2003,
will mature on May 1, 2004. The Revolver and Term Loan A, both of which were
originally due on June 30, 2005, will mature on August 1, 2004.
In addition to modifying the maturity dates of the Company senior debt,
the Amended Restructured Credit Facility also: i waives the debt covenant
violations at April 30, 2003, ii allows the Company to make certain earn-out
payments that were previously required to be deferred under the Restructured
Credit Facility, iii provides the Company with improved advance rates under
the Revolver on eligible accounts receivable and inventory and iv contains a
number of other affirmative covenants. These covenants include, but are not
limited to, the requirement that the Company meet certain amended leverage
ratio, interest coverage ratio, fixed charge ratio and minimum EBITDA thresholds
on an ongoing basis.
The Amended Restructured Credit Facility also changed the conditions under
which the Company senior lenders may exercise warrants to purchase the
Company common stock, modified the exercise schedule of the warrants
originally granted with the Restructured Credit Facility and increased the
number of shares of common stock potentially issuable upon exercise of the
F-31              WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Dollars In Thousands, Except Per Share Data warrants. Under the Amended Restructured Credit Facility, the Company senior
lenders now hold warrants for 2,400 shares which would represent approximately
152% of the Company outstanding common stock if the warrants were exercised.
The first warrant tranche, for 400 shares, becomes exercisable on December 31,
2003 unless, by November 30, 2003, the Company has delivered to its senior
lenders a plan that is acceptable to its lenders to repay, in total, all of the
outstanding obligations under the Amended Restructured Credit Facility.
Additional warrant tranches of 400 shares each become exercisable each month for
a period of five months beginning no later than March 31, 2004 but only in the
event there remains outstanding indebtedness under the Amended Restructured
Credit Facility on the date the tranche becomes exercisable. Each warrant
tranche would have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the
Company common stock on the date the tranche becomes exercisable. See further
