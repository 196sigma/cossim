Track 'n Trail and Subsidiaries
El Dorado Hills, California
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Track 'n Trail
and Subsidiaries as of December 27, 1997 and December 28, 1996, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the fiscal years ended December 27, 1997, December 28, 1996
and December 30, 1995. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Track 'n Trail
and Subsidiaries as of December 27, 1997 and December 28, 1996, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
fiscal years ended December 27, 1997, December 28, 1996 and December 30, 1995,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                     /s/ Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. Sacramento, California

TRACK 'N TRAIL AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                  BACKGROUND
Track 'n Trail, a Delaware corporation Company, is the successor to
businesses formerly conducted by Track 'n Trail, a California corporation
Track 'n Trail-California, and its subsidiary, Overland Management
Corporation Overland. In connection with the formation of the Company,
the Company issued an aggregate of 40,816 shares of its common stock to
existing stockholders of Track 'n Trail-California. A reorganization of
Track 'n Trail-California the Reorganization was effected on October 7,
1997, in which the Track 'n Trail-California stockholders exchanged 100% of
their Track 'n Trail-California common stock for 4,107,608 shares of the
Company common stock, inclusive of the 40,816 shares of the Company
common stock issued upon formation. The Reorganization, which was accounted
for in a manner similar to a pooling-of-interests, was accomplished in an
exchange of approximately 100 shares of the Company common stock for each
share of Track 'n Trail-California common stock. In connection with the
Reorganization, all of the common stock of Overland was transferred to the
Company in the form of a dividend resulting in the predecessor businesses
being wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. The accompanying financial
statements reflect, for all periods presented, the capital structure and
number of shares that are outstanding as a result of the Reorganization.
Accordingly, all references to the number of common and common equivalent
shares and to per share information in the consolidated financial statements
have been adjusted to reflect the capital structure resulting from the
Reorganization on a retroactive basis for all periods presented.
The Company is a retailer of footwear and related accessories. As of
December 27, 1997 and December 28, 1996, the Company operated 150 and 128
stores in 29 and 23 states, respectively, under the Track 'n Trail and
Overland Trading names concentrated in California, the Midwest and the
Northeast. Each store offers a wide range of rugged walking and fashion
casual shoes, sandals and boots. The Company ends its fiscal year on the
last Saturday in December.
The Company operates in a single business segment of retailing footwear and
related accessories. The Company acquires its shoes from a number of
manufacturers; however, during the fiscal years ended December 27, 1997 and
December 28, 1996, 429% and 397%, respectively, of the Company net sales
was of products purchased from three manufacturers.
INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
On October 16, 1997, the Company completed its initial public offering
Offering of its common stock. In connection with the Offering, the
Company issued 2,727,272 shares of common stock and received net proceeds of
$24,988,000, net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued  Upon closing of the Offering, the Company nonqualified and incentive 
stock options vested, resulting in a non-cash compensation charge reducing 
net income by $33,000, after netting the related income tax effect of 
$22,000.
Certain notes payable, which had an aggregate balance of approximately 
$177 million at the Offering became due and payable upon closing of the 
Offering. The Company used a portion of its proceeds of the Offering to 
retire these obligations.
During 1997, Track 'n Trail-California declared distributions to its 
stockholders of substantially all previously undistributed accumulated S 
corporation earnings remaining at the date of the Reorganization. Of such 
distributions, $6,400,000 were paid from a portion of the Company 
proceeds from the Offering.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The financial statements include the consolidated accounts of the Company 
and its two subsidiaries, Track 'n Trail-California and Overland. 
Overland became a 790% owned subsidiary on October 25, 1996, and a wholly 
owned subsidiary effective January 1, 1997 Note 13. All intercompany 
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits, money market accounts 
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three 
months or less.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at lower of cost, retail method, or market.
FIXED ASSETS
Fixed assets are stated at cost and depreciated on the straight-line 
method over the assets' estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten 
years; the cost of leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter 
of the lease term or useful life of the related assets. When assets are 
retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated 
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss 
is reflected in income for the period. The cost of maintenance and repairs 
is charged to income as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are 
capitalized.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED
1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued               STORE PRE-OPENING COSTS
Costs of a noncapital nature incurred prior to store openings are expensed 
as incurred.
GOODWILL
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value 
of the net assets of acquired companies and is being amortized using the 
straight-line method over 20 years.
MINORITY INTEREST
Minority interest represents the minority stockholders' proportionate 
share of the equity of Overland, including their share of Overland net 
income during the period from October 25, 1996 to December 28, 1996. At 
December 28, 1996, Track 'n Trail-California owned 790% of the common 
stock of Overland and Track 'n Trail-California stockholders owned the 
210% minority interest. Effective January 1, 1997, Track 'n 
Trail-California acquired the remaining 210% interest in Overland Note 
13.
INCOME TAXES
Commencing June 28, 1992, and until the Reorganization, Track 'n 
Trail-California had elected S corporation status for federal income taxes 
and most state income taxes. Overland is a C corporation for federal and 
state income tax purposes. Under S corporation status, Track 'n 
Trail-California income, other than that of Overland, was taxable to its 
stockholders personally, with only minimal state income taxes charged to 
Track 'n Trail-California.
Upon completion of the Reorganization in October 1997, Track 'n 
Trail-California converted from an S corporation to a C corporation under 
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and state statutes and, 
accordingly, became subject to federal and state income tax on all of its 
income. Upon termination of the S corporation election, deferred income 
taxes of $1,324,000, representing the net tax effect of differences 
between Track 'n Trail-California financial statement and tax bases in 
certain assets and liabilities, became a net asset and was included in the 
consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding non-recurring decrease in 
tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations as of the date of 
the Reorganization. Such deferred tax assets relate primarily to 
differences in the financial statement and tax bases of fixed assets and

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued  Pro forma net income unaudited has been computed to include a provision 
for income taxes at an effective tax rate of 400% representing 
management estimate of the effective tax rate as if the Reorganization 
had been in effect and Track 'n Trail-California had been a C corporation 
for all periods presented.
The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME 
TAXES, using the liability method. The estimated future tax effect of 
differences between the basis in assets and liabilities for tax and 
accounting purposes is accounted for as deferred taxes. In accordance 
with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, a valuation allowance would be 
established to reduce deferred tax assets if it were more likely than not 
that all, or some portion, of such deferred tax assets would not be 
realized. No allowance against deferred tax assets was provided as of 
December 27, 1997 or December 28, 1996.
STOCK OPTIONS
As permitted by SFAS No. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, the 
Company has elected to measure and record compensation costs relative to 
stock option and purchase plans in accordance with the provisions of 
Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK 
ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES, and make pro forma disclosure of net income and 
earnings per share as if the fair value based method of valuing stock 
options had been applied.
RENT EXPENSE
Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective 
lease term. Rents accrued but not contractually due are reported as 
deferred rent. Contingent rental expense, based on store sales, is 
recognized when incurred.
ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and 
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 
financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those 
estimates.

2. EARNINGS PER SHARE  Effective December 27, 1997, the Company adopted the provisions of 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, EARNINGS PER 
SHARE, which was effective for accounting periods ending after December 
15, 1997. SFAS No. 128 and related recently released positions of the 
staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission changed the method of 
calculating earnings per share and require a dual presentation of basic 
and diluted earnings per share. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 
No. 128, historical and pro forma earnings per share information for all 
periods presented have been restated to the methodology and disclosures 
specified in SFAS No. 128.
A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and 
diluted earnings per share computations under SFAS No. 128 is as follows

2. EARNINGS PER SHARE, continued  All warrants outstanding and certain options with exercise prices in 
excess of market value were not dilutive and, accordingly, were not 
included in the weighted average number of common and common equivalent 
shares outstanding.
In applying the treasury stock method for determining the dilution 
applicable to stock options outstanding, the incremental shares assumed 
issued excess of shares assumed issued over the number of shares assumed 
purchased was determined using the sum of exercise proceeds, future 
compensation and tax benefit to the Company upon exercise of the options 
as the assumed proceeds that would have been used to purchase shares at 
the average value during the period. Average market value was based on 
estimated fair values for periods prior to the Offering and market prices 
thereafter.
Distribution shares included in weighted average common shares outstanding 
used to compute pro forma diluted earnings per share unaudited for 
fiscal 1997 represents the weighted number of shares of common stock sold 
in the Offering, the net proceeds of which were necessary to pay the 
excess of S corporation distributions paid or declared during the twelve 
month period preceding the Offering over earnings during the twelve month 
period preceding the Offering. Distribution shares included in the 
computation of pro forma diluted earnings per share unaudited for the 
fiscal 1996 represents the number of shares of common stock sold in the 
Offering, the proceeds of which would be necessary to pay the excess of S 
corporation distributions paid or declared during fiscal 1996 and 
thereafter until the consummation of the Offering over earnings during 
fiscal 1996.

investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date 
of purchase. Cash deposits periodically exceed the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation insured limit of $100,000 for each account.

5. REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT AND LONG-TERM DEBT  In 1997 and 1996, the Company had a revolving loan agreement Revolving 
Loan Agreement which was paid in full from a portion of the proceeds of 
the Offering.
Upon the consummation of the Offering, the Company obtained a $100 
million revolving line of credit Revolving Line from a bank, which is 
due October 1999. Of the total amount available under the line, up to 
$15 million may be allocated to letters of credit. Advances under the 
Revolving Line, including outstanding letters of credit of which $857,000 
were issued at December 27, 1997, are limited to a percentage of eligible 
inventory. Available additional borrowings under the Revolving Line were 
approximately $91 million at December 27, 1997. Borrowings under the 
Revolving Line are collateralized by substantially all of the Company 
assets.
The Revolving Line bears interest, at the option of the Company, at either 
the bank reference rate 850% at December 27, 1997 or LIBOR 591% at 
December 27, 1997, plus 20%, payable monthly. The weighted average 
interest rates for fiscal years 1997, 1996 and 1995, were 894%, 877% and

6. STOCK OPTION AND PURCHASE PLANS              STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
Until canceled on July 1, 1996, the Company had granted stock appreciation 
rights to certain key employees, which were measured and were vesting over 
the period from 1992 to 1997. Under the agreements, the employees were to 
receive certain percentages of appreciation of the Company capital stock 
during the measurement period based on agreed-upon appreciation 
measurement methodologies. Compensation expense was accrued over the term 
of the agreements for the cost of the stock appreciation rights.
The stock appreciation rights were canceled on July 1, 1996, in exchange 
for grants of nonqualified options under the Company 1996 Stock Option 
Plan, as described below. The accrued liability at the date of 
cancellation in connection with compensation previously recognized under 
the stock appreciation rights was offset against total compensation 
inherent in the nonqualified stock options granted.
STOCK OPTION PLAN
In June 1996, Track 'n Trail-California stockholders approved the adoption 
of the 1996 Stock Option Plan Plan. Effective upon the Reorganization, 
the Company assumed the Plan and, effective as of the date of the 
Offering, amended and restated the Plan. Upon the Reorganization, options 
to purchase shares of the Company common stock were exchanged for all 
stock options then outstanding pursuant to the Plan to purchase shares of 
the common stock of Track 'n Trail-California. The terms and conditions 
of the options exchanged were equivalent. A total of 1,055,735 shares of 
common stock are reserved for issuance under the Plan.
The Plan provides for the granting of nonstatutory stock options NSOs to 
employees, directors, consultants and advisors of the Company. The Plan 
also provides for the granting of incentive stock options ISOs to 
employees. The Plan provides for formula grants to non-employee directors 
of the Company Outside Directors. Each such Outside Director 
automatically received NSOs to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock upon 
their initial appointment as an Outside Director and, upon each annual 
meeting of stockholders after their initial appointment, will receive NSOs 
to purchase 1,250 shares unless the Outside Director was appointed prior 
to such a meeting, in which case the annual grant will occur at the second 
annual meeting following the initial appointment. The Plan provides that 
the option exercise price for ISOs and Outside Director options must be at 
least equal to 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the 
date of grant. Options will have exercise and vesting terms as determined 
at the date of the grant by a compensation committee of the Company 
board of directors; however, the options must have exercise and vesting 
terms of no more than ten years from the date of grant.

The weighted average remaining contractual life at December 27, 1997, of 
all outstanding options, all outstanding NSOs with an exercise price of 
$001 and all outstanding ISOs was 85 years, and for all outstanding NSOs 
with an exercise price of $975 was 98 years.
All outstanding ISOs vested upon the Offering. No compensation resulted 
from the grant of ISOs in fiscal 1996.
NSOs for 177,825 shares vested upon grant, 34,558 shares vested on 
December 15, 1996, and an additional 138,235 shares vested upon the 
Offering. The remaining NSOs for 10,000 shares granted to the Outside 
Directors upon appointment vest prorata on October 16 of each of four 
years commencing on October 16, 1998.
The excess of the fair value of common stock at the date of the grant over 
the exercise price of the NSOs represents the per share compensation of 
the NSOs that is recorded as compensation and as an increase in additional 
paid-in capital when the stock options vest. A one-time increase in 
additional paid-in capital of $597,000 was recorded in 1996 for the 
liability that was eliminated upon exchange of the stock appreciation 
rights for NSOs.

stock appreciation rights, amounted to $67,000, $116,000 and $196,000 
during the 1997, 1996 and 1995 fiscal years, respectively.
EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
In April 1997, the Company adopted the Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
Purchase Plan effective as of the closing of the Offering. The Purchase 
Plan covers an aggregate of 150,000 shares of common stock and is intended 
to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan within the meaning of 
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan administrator, 
appointed by the Company board of directors, may authorize participation 
by eligible employees, including officers, in periodic Purchase Plan 
offerings. Under its terms, the board of directors may amend, modify or 
terminate the Purchase Plan at any time without notice.
Substantially all full-time as defined employees with at least one year 
service prior to the commencement of the participation period are eligible 
to participate in the Purchase Plan; however, any highly compensated 
employee as defined who owns 30% or more of the outstanding stock in 
the Company may not participate in the Purchase Plan. Employees who 
participate in a Purchase Plan offering may have a percentage of their 
earnings as established by the plan administrator withheld pursuant to 
the Purchase Plan. The amount withheld will be used to purchase shares of 
common stock on dates specified by the board at a price that will be equal 
to 850% of the lesser of the fair market value of the common stock at the 
commencement of each Purchase Plan offering period or at the relevant 
purchase date. Employees may end their participation in a Purchase Plan 
offering at any time during the Purchase Plan offering period except as 
provided under the terms of the Purchase Plan offering. Participation ends 
automatically on termination of employment with the Company.
The initial Purchase Plan offering commenced in October 1997 and 
terminated on December 31, 1997. A second Purchase Plan offering 
commenced January 1, 1998, and will terminate no later than December 31, 
1999. As of December 27, 1997, no shares had been issued under the 
Purchase Plan. In January 1998, 2,833 shares of common stock were issued 
pursuant to the Purchase Plan for $21,000.

COMPENSATION, of all options granted during fiscal 1997 and 1996, net of 
the liability recorded in 1996 in connection with stock appreciation 
rights canceled in exchange for the NSOs, was $61,000 and $170,000, 
respectively. The weighed-average, grant-date fair value was estimated in

periodic increases stipulated in the lease agreements fixed amounts or 
percentages, in some cases, and increases indexed to consumer price 
increases, in other cases. Some leases also provide for contingent 
rentals based on sales. The Company is generally responsible for

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management 
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of 
the deferred taxes will not be realized. Based upon the availability of 
management projections for future taxable income over the period in 
which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes the 
existing net deductible temporary differences will reverse during periods 
in which carrybacks are available and/or in which the Company generates 
net taxable income.

11. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating
the fair value of its significant financial instruments  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated
balance sheets approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term
maturity of these financial instruments.
BANK LINE OF CREDIT: The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the
floating interest rate and short maturity nature of these financial
instruments.
LONG-TERM DEBT: The carrying amounts, totaling $236,000 at December 27,
1997, are not believed to differ materially from fair value. The carrying
amounts at December 28, 1996, approximate fair value due to floating rates on
the recent issuance of the fixed rate notes.                    -42             TRACK 'N TRAIL AND SUBSIDIARIES
