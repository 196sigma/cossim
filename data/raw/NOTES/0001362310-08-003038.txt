23 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule13a-15f or
15d-15f. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 2provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the Company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material
effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The scope of managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting includes the Companys consolidated subsidiaries, except for certain businesses
acquired by the Company on December21, 2007 and March14, 2008, respectively, as permitted by the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Companys consolidated net
sales for the year ended March31, 2008 were $11billion, of which the certain businesses acquired
by the Company on December21, 2007 and March14, 2008, totaled $166million. The Companys
consolidated total assets as of March31, 2008 were $8727million, of which the certain businesses
acquired by the Company on December21, 2007 and March14, 2008, totaled $1209million. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based
on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on our evaluation under the framework in
Internal Control Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of March31, 2008. The Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of March31, 2008 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is included on page 26. 24 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Consolidated Graphics, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Consolidated Graphics, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of March31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March31,
2008. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Consolidated Graphics, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
March31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended March31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. As discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, effective April1, 2007, the
Company adopted FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No109. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, Consolidated Graphics, Inc.s and subsidiaries internal control over
financial reporting as of March31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, and our report dated May28, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

Consolidated Graphics, Inc. We have audited Consolidated Graphics, Inc. the Company internal control over financial
reporting as of March31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included
in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of March31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. The Company acquired certain businesses on December21, 2007 and March14, 2008, and management
excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting
as of March31, 2008, the certain businesses internal control over financial reporting associated
with the total assets of $1209million, and total revenues of $166million included in the
consolidated financial statements of the Company and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended
March31, 2008. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also
excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the certain businesses. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of March31, 2008, the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended March31, 2008, and our report dated May28, 2008 expressed an
unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

In thousands, except share and per share data and percentages 1. BUSINESS Consolidated Graphics, Inc. collectively with its consolidated subsidiaries referred to as
the Company is a leading provider of commercial printing services. The Companys printing businesses maintain their own sales, customer service, estimating and
planning, prepress, production and accounting departments. The Companys corporate headquarters
staff provides support to its printing businesses in such areas as human resources, purchasing,
internal financial controls design and management information systems. The Company also maintains
centralized treasury, risk management, tax, internal audit and consolidated financial reporting
activities. The Companys sales are derived from commercial printing services. These services consist of
itraditional print services, including electronic prepress, digital and offset printing,
finishing, storage and delivery of high-quality printed documents which are custom manufactured to
the design specifications of the Companys customers; iifulfillment and mailing services for
such printed materials, and iiidigital technology solutions and e-commerce capabilities that
enable the Companys customers to more efficiently procure and manage printed materials and/or
design, procure, distribute, track and analyze results of printing-based marketing programs and
activities. The scope and extent of services provided to the Companys customers typically varies for each
individual order it receives, depending on customer-specific factors including the intended uses
for the printed materials. Furthermore, each of the Companys locations generally is capable of
providing a complete range of services to its customers. Accordingly, the Company does not operate
its business in a manner that differentiates among its respective capabilities and services for
financial or management reporting purposes, rather each of its printing businesses is defined as a
distinct reporting unit. 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND OTHER INFORMATION Accounting Policies The accounting policies of the Company reflect industry practices and conform to generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States. The more significant of such accounting
policies are described below. Principles of ConsolidationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Companys operations constitute one
reportable segment because all of its printing businesses operate in the commercial printing
industry and exhibit similar economic characteristics. Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires the use of certain estimates and assumptions by management in
determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities as
of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period including depreciation of property and equipment and amortization or
impairment of intangible assets. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing
basis and relies on historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be
reasonable under the circumstances to determine such estimates. Because uncertainties with respect
to estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements, actual
results could differ from these estimates. ReclassificationCertain reclassifications of prior periods data have been made to conform to
the current period reporting. Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with
original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 31 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED GRAPHICS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In thousands, except share and per share data and percentages Revenue Recognition and Accounts ReceivableThe Company primarily recognizes revenue upon
delivery of the printed product to the customer. In the case of customer fulfillment arrangements,
including multiple deliverables of printing services and distribution services, revenue relating to
the printed product is recognized upon the delivery of the printed product into the Companys
fulfillment warehouses, and invoicing of the customer for the product at an agreed price. Because
printed products manufactured for the Companys customers are customized based upon the customers
specifications, product returns are insignificant. The Company derives the majority of its revenues
from sales and services to a broad and diverse group of customers with no individual customer
accounting for more than 3% of the Companys revenues in any of the years ended March31, 2008,
2007 or 2006. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected
collectibility of accounts receivable. Accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets are reflected net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $3,575 and $3,080 at March31, 2008
and 2007. InventoriesInventories are valued at the lower of cost or market utilizing the first-in,
first-out method for raw materials and the specific identification method for work in progress and
finished goods. Raw materials consist of paper, ink, proofing materials, plates, boxes and other
general supplies. Inventory values consist of purchased raw materials, labor and overhead costs. The carrying values of
inventories are set forth below

Long-Lived AssetsThe Company determines the realization of goodwill in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
and its other long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets
other than goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with SFAS No144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Under SFAS No142, the Company
determines fair value using earnings before interest and income taxes and the weighted average
costs of capital adjusted by a growth rate for each reporting unit. Each of the Companys printing
businesses is separately evaluated for goodwill impairment because they comprise individual
reporting units. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the end of each fiscal year, or
at any time that management becomes aware of an indication of impairment. Under SFAS No144, the
Company compares the carrying value of long-lived assets to its fair value determined by using
projections of future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets and other factors such as
business trends and general economic conditions. In the event that the carrying value of any
long-lived asset exceeds its fair value, the Company records an impairment charge against income
equal to the excess of the carrying value over the assets fair value. The Company evaluates
long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets other than
goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives whenever events or changes in conditions
indicate that the carry value may not be recoverable. Goodwill totaled $102,423 at March31, 2008 and represents the excess of the Companys
purchase cost over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses, net of previously
recorded amortization and impairment expense. As of March31, 2008, the Company conducted its
annual evaluation of goodwill and determined that no impairment was required. As of March31, 2007,
the Company conducted its annual evaluation of goodwill and determined that an impairment of the
goodwill attributable to four printing businesses totaling $11,533 was necessary. A tax benefit of
$3,717 was recorded in connection with the impairment. The net book value of other intangible assets at March31, 2008 was $38,958. Other intangible
assets consist primarily of the value assigned to such items as customer lists and trade names in
connection with the allocation of purchase price for acquisitions and are
generally amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of up to 25years. Amortization expense
totaled $2,426 in 2008, $1,608 in 2007 and $1,321 in 2006. 32 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED GRAPHICS, INC.

Other accrued liabilities are principally comprised of contingent
transaction consideration associated with
certain of the Companys acquisitions and accrued self-insurance claims for certain
insurance programs. None
of the individual items in other accrued liabilities at March31, 2008 and 2007 were
individually greater than
5% of total current liabilities in those years. Income TaxesThe provision for income taxes includes federal, state and foreign income taxes
currently payable and deferred based on currently enacted tax laws. Deferred income taxes are
provided for the tax consequences of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of
assets and liabilities. The Company reduces deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance when,
based on its estimates, it is more likely than not that a portion of those assets will not be
realized in a future period. Supplemental Cash Flow InformationThe consolidated statements of cash flows provide
information about the Companys sources and uses of cash and exclude the effects of non-cash
transactions. Certain of the Companys capital expenditures are considered to be non-cash
transactions. The Company issued term notes payable totaling $41,015 and $5,110 see Note 5.
Long-Term Debt in the years ended March31, 2008 and 2007 to finance the purchase of certain new
equipment. The Company paid cash for interest and income taxes, net of refunds, totaling $12,663
and $26,745 in 2008, $6,030 and $33,895 in 2007, and $5,373 and $18,952 in 2006. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurement, which defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurement. The Companys adoption
of SFAS No157 effective as of April1, 2008 is not expected to have a material impact on its
consolidated financial condition or results of operations. In February2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB No115. SFAS No159 permits entities to
choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible items at fair value the fair value
option. A business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair
value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting period. The Companys
adoption of SFAS No159 effective as of April1, 2008 is not expected to have a material impact on
its consolidated financial condition or results of operations. In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141R, Business Combinations. SFAS No141R
requires the acquiring entity to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any
non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at the fair values as of
that date. Goodwill is measured as a residual of the fair values at acquisition date. Acquisition
related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition. The Companys adoption of SFAS No.
141R effective as of April1, 2009 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated
financial condition or results of operations. In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No160, Non-controlling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No160 requires non-controlling interests in a subsidiary
be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements, the attributable net income be
identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income and changes in the
ownership be accounted for consistently. The statement also includes requirements when an interest
is deconsolidated. Disclosure should be sufficient to clearly identify and distinguish between the
interests of the reporting entity and that of the non-controlling interests owners. The Companys
adoption of SFAS No160 effective as of April1, 2009 is not expected to have a material impact on
its consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 33 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED GRAPHICS, INC.

In thousands, except share and per share data and percentages Other Information Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflect net
income divided by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive stock options
outstanding. Related Party TransactionsIn the normal course of business, the Company leases certain real
estate from individuals who formerly owned an acquired printing business and are now employed by
the Company. Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe Companys financial instruments consist of cash, trade
receivables, trade payables and debt obligations. The Company does not currently hold or issue
derivative financial instruments. The Company believes that the fair value of its variable rate
debt obligations, which totaled $276,499 and $101,297 at March31, 2008 and 2007, approximated
their recorded values. The Company estimates that the fair value of its fixed rate debt obligations
totaling $109,186 at March31, 2008 was $98,180 and that the fair value of its fixed rate debt
obligations totaling $53,268 at March31, 2007 was $53,335. Estimates of fair value are based on
estimated interest rates for the same or similar debt offered to the Company having the same or
similar maturities and collateral requirements. Concentrations of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk are primarily trade accounts receivable. Concentrations of credit
risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited because the Companys printing
businesses provide services to a large, diverse group of customers in various geographical regions.
Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require
collateral for extensions of credit. The Companys cash deposits are held with large, well-known
financial institutions. Stock-Based CompensationThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with
SFAS No123 R, Share-Based Payment, and it measures the cost of the employee services received
in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of
grant rather than its intrinsic value. In addition, to the extent that the Company receives a tax
benefit upon exercise of an award, such benefit is reflected under SFAS No123R as cash flow
from financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows rather than operating
activities as in 2006. Foreign Currency TranslationAssets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the
United States with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated at quarter-end
exchange rates. Income and expense items are translated at the average monthly exchange rate. The
effects of translation are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
shareholders equity. In 2008, the Company recorded a net foreign currency transaction gain of
$3,064 related to the revaluation of certain transactions denominated in currencies other than the
reporting units functional currency. The net foreign currency transaction gain is recorded in
Other Income on the Consolidated Income Statement. Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeOther comprehensive income is comprised exclusively of
foreign currency translation adjustments. Geographic InformationRevenues and long-lived assets of the Companys subsidiaries operating
outside the United States were $46,088 and $28,610 as of and for the year ended March31, 2008. 3. ACQUISITIONS All of the Companys acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. Revenues and expenses of the acquired businesses have been included in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements beginning on their respective dates of acquisition. The
allocation of purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities is based on estimates of fair
value and may be prospectively revised if and when additional information the Company is awaiting
concerning certain asset and liability valuations is obtained, provided that such information is
received no later than one year after the date of acquisition. Contingent transaction consideration
pursuant to earnout agreements is accrued as an additional cost of the transaction when payment
thereof is deemed to be probable by the Company. In fiscal 2008, the Company paid cash totaling $91,140 to acquire the operations and assets of
three printing businesses. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price of the businesses
acquired includes current assets of $39,034, property and equipment of $39,872, goodwill and other
intangible assets of $44,549 and other assets of $212, less accrued liabilities of $18,802 and debt
assumed of $13,725. Additionally, the Company paid cash totaling $6,118 to satisfy certain 34 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED GRAPHICS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In thousands, except share and per share data and percentages liabilities incurred in connection with certain prior period acquisitions. Based on certain
additional information received by the Company regarding its fiscal 2007 acquisitions, $3,687 of
purchase price previously attributed to goodwill was allocated to other intangible assets during
fiscal 2008. The Company is awaiting additional information concerning certain asset and liability
valuations in order to finalize the allocation of purchase price for certain fiscal 2008
acquisitions, and expects to receive such information no later than one year following the
respective dates of acquisition. In fiscal 2007, the Company paid cash totaling $62,406 to acquire the operations and assets of
two printing businesses. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price of the businesses
acquired include current assets of $18,890, property and equipment of $45,944, goodwill and other
intangible assets of $15,507 and other assets of $216, less accrued liabilities of $18,151.
Additionally, the Company ipaid cash totaling $5,107 to acquire certain real property and ii
paid net cash totaling $42 in connection with the finalization of certain working capital
adjustments during fiscal 2007 relating to prior year acquisitions. Based on certain additional
information received by the Company regarding its fiscal 2006 acquisitions, $1,530 of purchase
price previously attributed to other intangible assets was allocated to goodwill during fiscal
2007. 4. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The costs of major
renewals and betterments are capitalized; repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred.
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets. The following is a summary of the Companys property and equipment and their estimated useful

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In thousands, except share and per share data and percentages The Companys primary bank credit facility as amended, the Credit Agreement currently
provides for $335,000 in revolving credit and has a maturity date of October6, 2011. At March31,
2008, outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement were $233,000 and accrued interest at a
weighted average rate of 39%. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement the proceeds from borrowings may be used to repay
certain indebtedness, finance certain acquisitions, provide for working capital and general
corporate purposes and, subject to certain restrictions, repurchase the Companys common stock.
Borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Companys
assets other than real estate and certain equipment subject to term equipment notes and other
financings. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement accrue interest, at the Companys option, at
either 1the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus a margin of 625% to 150%, or 2an
alternate base rate based upon the greater of the agent banks prime lending rate or the Federal
Funds effective rate plus 50%. The Company is also required to pay an annual commitment fee
ranging from 15% to 275% on available but unused amounts under the Credit Agreement. The interest
rate margin and the commitment fee are based upon certain financial performance measures set forth
in the Credit Agreement and are redetermined quarterly. At March31, 2008, the applicable LIBOR
interest rate margin was 100% and the applicable commitment fee was 20%. The Company is subject to certain covenants and restrictions and must meet certain financial
tests under the Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with such covenants, restrictions
and financial tests at March31, 2008. The Company also maintains an unsecured credit facility with a commercial bank as amended,
the AB Credit Facility currently consisting of a U.S. $5,000 maximum borrowing limit component
and a separate Canadian $31,000 maximum borrowing limit component. On March13, 2008, the Company
entered into a First Amendment to the AB Credit Agreement, which decreased the U.S. maximum
borrowing limit to $5,000 and increased the separate Canadian maximum borrowing limit to $31,000.
At March31, 2008, outstanding borrowings were U.S. $2,200, which accrued interest at a weighted
average rate of 53%, and Canadian $28,000 $27,365 U.S. equivalent, which accrued interest at a
weighted average rate of 58%. Under the terms of the AB Credit Facility, U.S. dollar denominated borrowings accrue interest
and bear an annual commitment fee at rates equal to those under the Credit Agreement. Canadian
dollar denominated borrowings accrue interest at the Companys option, at either 1the Canadian
Dollar Offer Rate CDOR plus a margin of 625% to 150%, or 2an alternate base rate based
upon the Canadian Prime Rate. The Company is also required to pay an annual commitment fee ranging
from 15% to 275% on available but unused Canadian dollar amounts. For both the U.S. and Canadian
components, the interest rate margin and the commitment fee are based upon the financial
performance measures set forth in the Credit Agreement and are redetermined quarterly. An annual
reduction of Canadian $4,000 on the Canadian dollar denominated commitment occurs on each
anniversary date of the AB Credit Facility until the final maturity date of January2, 2011. There
are no significant covenants or restrictions set forth in the AB Credit Facility; however, a
default by the Company under the Credit Agreement will constitute a default under the AB Credit
Facility. At March31, 2008, the applicable CDOR interest rate margin was 100% and the applicable
commitment fee was 20%. Proceeds from borrowings under the AB Credit Facility may be used for
general corporate purposes. In addition the Company maintains two auxiliary revolving credit facilities each an
Auxiliary Bank Facility and collectively the Auxiliary Bank Facilities with commercial banks.
Each Auxiliary Bank Facility is unsecured and has a maximum borrowing capacity of $5,000. One
facility expires in October2008 while the other facility expires in December2008. At March31,
2008, outstanding borrowings under the Auxiliary Bank Facilities totaled $9,302 and accrued
interest at a weighted average rate of 37%. Because the Company currently has the ability and
intent to refinance borrowings outstanding under the Auxiliary Bank Facilities expiring in October
and December2008, such borrowings are classified as long-term debt in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet at March31, 2008. The Auxiliary Bank Facilities cross-default to the
covenants and restrictions set forth in the Credit Agreement. 36 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED GRAPHICS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In thousands, except share and per share data and percentages At March31, 2008, outstanding borrowings under term equipment notes totaled $104,505 and
accrued interest at rates between 39% and 71%. The term equipment notes provide for principal
payments plus interest for defined periods of up to ten years from the date of issuance, and are
secured by certain equipment of the Company. The Company is not subject to any significant
financial covenants in connection with any of the term equipment notes. At March31, 2008,
outstanding borrowings under our real estate notes totaled $4,438 and accrued interest at 6%. The
real estate notes provide for principal payments plus interest for defined periods of up to ten
years from the date of issuance and are secured by the real estate. At March31, 2008, other debt
obligations totaled $4,889 and provided for principal payments plus interest fixed and variable
rates for defined periods up to 15years from the date of issuance. The Company does not have any
significant financial covenants or restrictions associated with the real estate notes or other debt
obligations. The Credit Agreement places certain limitations on the amount of additional term note
obligations the Company may incur in the future. The principal payment requirements by fiscal year under the Companys debt obligations

Deferred income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts as measured based on enacted tax
laws and regulations. The Company records a valuation allowance, when appropriate, to adjust
deferred tax asset balances to the amount the Company expects to realize. The Company considers the
amount of taxable income available in carryback years and expectations of future taxable income,
among other factors, in assessing the potential need for a valuation allowance. As of March31,
2008 and 2007, a valuation allowance of $1,454 and $816 was recorded related to certain deferred
tax assets. The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows

These deferred income tax assets are long-term in nature and
therefore are netted against total deferred income tax liabilities for
presentation in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. On April1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48, which addresses the accounting for uncertainty
in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute
for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The cumulative effect of
adopting FIN 48 was recorded as a net increase to retained earnings of $1,189. At the date of the adoption of FIN 48, the Company had $19,334 of unrecognized tax benefits,
including applicable interest and penalties. As of March31, 2008 the balance of unrecognized tax
benefits was $13,655. Of the unrecognized tax benefits at March31, 2008, $11,248, if recognized,
would decrease the Companys effective income tax rate and increase net income. The unrecognized
tax benefits relate to certain tax deductions claimed on federal and state tax returns for which
the ultimate outcome is uncertain. 38 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED GRAPHICS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In thousands, except share and per share data and percentages In the year ended March31, 2008, the Company reduced the amount of unrecognized tax benefits
by $5,679. Of this amount, $2,220 resulted in a reduction of tax expense. As of March31, 2008, the
Company believes it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits may increase within
12months by as much as $1,721, due primarily to certain tax deductions claimed on state tax
returns for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain. The Companys federal income tax returns for the tax years after 2003 remain subject to
examination. The various states in which the Company is subject to income tax are generally open
for the tax years after 2002. The Company classifies interest expense and any related penalties related to income tax
uncertainties as a component of income tax expense. For the year-ended March31, 2008, the Company
had recognized $697 of net interest income related to tax uncertainties. Accrued interest and
penalties of $2,633 and $1,619 related to income tax uncertainties were recognized as a component
of other noncurrent liabilities at April1, 2007 and March31, 2008, respectively. The Companys unrecognized tax benefit activity for the fiscal year ended March31, 2008 was

statements, and the Companys assumption of certain contingent liabilities related to certain of
its acquisitions, the Company had letters of credit outstanding as of March31, 2008 totaling
$6,604. All of these letters of credit were issued pursuant to the terms of the Companys Credit
Agreement, which expires in October2011, and the Company will be required to obtain replacement
letters of credit at that time, as needed. 39 Table of Contents CONSOLDATED GRAPHICS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In thousands, except share and per share data and percentages Insurance ProgramsThe Company maintains third-party insurance coverage in amounts and against
risks it believes are reasonable in its circumstances. The Company is self-insured for most
workers compensation claims and for a significant component of its group health insurance
programs. For these exposures, the Company accrues expected loss amounts which are determined using
a combination of its historical loss experience and subjective assessment of its future loss
exposure, together with advice provided by administrators and consulting actuaries. The estimates
of expected loss amounts are subject to uncertainties arising from various sources, including
changes in claims reporting patterns, claims settlement patterns, judicial decisions, legislation
and economic conditions, which could result in an increase or decrease in accrued costs in future
periods for claim matters which occurred in a prior period. Although the Company believes that the
accrued estimated loss amounts are reasonable under the circumstances, significant differences
related to the items noted above could materially affect our risk exposure, insurance obligations
and future expense. Legal MattersFrom time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that
arise in the ordinary course of its business. Currently, there are no legal proceedings or claims
pending against the Company that management believes could have a material adverse effect upon the
Companys consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Tax MattersThe Company is subject to examination by tax authorities for varying periods in
various taxing jurisdictions. During the course of such examinations disputes occur as to matters
of fact and/or law. Also, in most taxing
jurisdictions the passage of time without examination will result in the expiration of applicable
statutes of limitations thereby precluding the taxing authority from conducting an examination of
the tax period for which such statute of limitation has expired. The Company believes that it has
adequately provided for its tax liabilities. 8. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Pursuant to the Consolidated Graphics, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended the Plan,
employees of the Company and members of the Companys Board of Directors have been, or may be,
granted options to purchase shares of the Companys common stock, restricted stock unit awards or
other forms of equity-based compensation. Options granted pursuant to the Plan include incentive
stock options within the meaning of Section422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended and non-qualified stock options. Options previously granted under the Plan were at a
price not less than the market price of the stock at the date of grant and periodically vest over a
fixed period of up to ten years. Unvested options generally are cancelled upon termination of
employment and vested options generally expire shortly after termination of employment. Otherwise,
options expire after final vesting at the end of a fixed period generally not in excess of an
additional five years. At March31, 2008, a total of 2,274,784 shares were reserved for issuance
pursuant to the Plan, of which 817,307 shares of the Companys common stock were reserved for
future grants. The following table sets forth option and restricted stock unit award transactions under the
