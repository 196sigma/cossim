To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Shared Technologies 
Cellular, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of 
Shared Technologies Cellular, Inc. and Subsidiary as of December 
31, 1997 and 1996 and the related consolidated statements of 
operations, stockholders' equity, cash flows and financial 
statement schedule for each of the three years in the 
period ended December 31, 1997. These financial statements and 
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the 
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion 
on these financial statements and financial statement schedule 
based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted 
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit 
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating 
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our 
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to 
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated 
financial position of Shared Technologies Cellular, Inc. and 
Subsidiary as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of 
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years 
in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, 
the financial statement schedule referred to above, when 
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial 
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all 
material respects, the information required to be included 
therein. ROTHSTEIN, KASS & COMPANY, P.C.

NOTE 1 -	Nature of Operations Shared Technologies Cellular, Inc. STC together with its 
subsidiary collectively the Company is a nationwide provider 
of short-term cellular telephone services, activation services and 
debit telephone services in the United States. The Company operations are subject to regulation by the 
Federal Communications Commission FCC, which has generally 
preempted the regulatory jurisdiction of state agencies with 
respect to the business in which the Company is engaged.
NOTE 2 -	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 
STC and its wholly-owned subsidiary. All material intercompany 
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Cash The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which 
at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not 
experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not 
subject to any significant credit risk on cash. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair value of the Company assets and liabilities which 
qualify as financial instruments under Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 107 approximates the carrying amounts 
presented in the consolidated balance sheets. Carrier Commissions Receivable Carrier commissions receivable are due from cellular carriers 
for new cellular telephone line activations done by the Company 
for third parties. The commissions are earned only after the 
cellular telephone user has remained on the cellular telephone 
network for a specified period of time vesting period. 
The Company records an allowance, as a reduction to carrier 
commissions receivable, for estimated cancellations of cellular 
service by the user prior to the end of the aforementioned vesting 
period. Although there is a short-term vesting period for which 
the Company must wait in order to receive its commission, the 
Company believes that the revenue process has been completed. Inventories Inventories, consisting of telecommunications equipment and 
parts expected to be sold to customers, are valued at the lower of 
cost, on the first-in, first-out FIFO method, or market. 
NOTE 2 -	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews its long-lived assets, such as 
telecommunications and office equipment, identifiable intangibles 
and goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the 
assets may not be fully recoverable. To determine the 
recoverability of its long-lived assets, the Company evaluates the 
probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be less 
than the carrying amount of the assets. Impairment is the amount 
by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Telecommunications and Office Equipment Telecommunications and office equipment are stated at cost. 
The Company records depreciation on the straight-line method over 
the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows Telecommunications equipment	2-5 years Office equipment	3-5 years Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market 
value of net assets of acquired businesses and is amortized over 
periods ranging from 15 to 20 years from the respective 
acquisition dates. The Company monitors the cash flows of the 
acquired operations to assess whether any impairment of recorded 
goodwill has occurred. Deferred start-up costs relate to costs associated with the 
opening of new cellular telephone rental locations throughout the 
United States. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis 
over 12 months. The number of new locations opened in 1997 and 
1996 was none and 18, respectively. The Company amortizes the cost to obtain exclusive agreements 
to provide cellular telephone rentals at specific locations on the 
straight-line basis over the life of the respective agreements, 
generally five to six years. Capitalized software development costs, including significant 
product enhancements incurred subsequent to establishing 
technological feasibility in the process of software production, 
are capitalized according to Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 86. Costs incurred prior to the establishment 
of technological feasibility are charged to research, product 
development, and support expenses. Capitalized software costs 
relate to developing a system in which the cellular telephones 
physically located in the rental cars can regularly communicate 
with the corporate offices. This software, in conjunction 
with the cellular telephone, was to be used for customer billing 
and other monitoring functions. In 1997, these capitalized 
software development costs were written off with the 
discontinuation of the in-car product line Note 14. NOTE 2 -	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued Advertising Costs
The Company expenses costs of advertising and promotions as 
incurred. Advertising expenses included in selling, general and 
administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 1997, 
1996 and 1995 were approximately $132,000 $153,000 and $137,000, 
respectively. Income Taxes
The Company filed its federal income tax returns on a 
consolidated basis with its former parent through April 1995, the 
date of its initial public offering IPO. Subsequent to April 
1995, the Company income tax returns are being filed separately. The Company complies with Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 109 SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, 
which requires an asset and liability approach to financial 
reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities are computed for differences between the 
financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that 
will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future, based 
on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which 
the differences are expected to affect taxable income. 
Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce 
the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to 
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Loss Per Common Share
Effective December 31, 1997, the Company adopted Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 SFAS No. 128, Earnings 
Per Share. SFAS No. 128 requires dual presentation of basic and 
diluted earnings per share for all periods presented. Basic 
earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing 
loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average 
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted 
earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could 
occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were 
exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the 
issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the 
entity. Prior period loss information has been restated as 
required by SFAS No. 128. Diluted loss per common share is the 
same as basic loss per common share for the years ended December 
31, 1997, 1996 and 1995. Unexercised employee stock options to 
purchase 365,000, 281,000 and 231,000 shares of the Company 
common stock as of December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively, 
were not included in the computations of diluted earnings per 
share because their effect would have been antidilutive as a 
result of the Company losses.
NOTE 3 -	Liquidity The Company has incurred cumulative net losses of 
approximately $16,700,000 through December 31, 1997 and has a 
working capital deficit of approximately $7,000,000 at December 
31, 1997. Management plans are to raise debt or equity financing 
and the Company has received $1,000,000 of long-term debt 
financing from an executive/stockholder of the Company on March 
19, 1998. In addition, on March 31, 1998, the 
executive/stockholder has committed to fund an additional 
$2,000,000 of long-term debt financing if the Company is 
unsuccessful in raising additional third-party financing by April 
30, 1998. Long-term liquidity is dependent on the Company 
ability to obtain additional long-term financing and attain 
profitable operations.
NOTE 4 -	Acquisitions In April 1996, the Company completed its acquisition of 
substantially all of the assets of its only franchisee, Summit 
Assurance Cellular Inc. and subsidiaries and affiliates Summit. 
The purchase price was $3,563,000, comprised of $335,000 in cash, 
the assumption of $669,000 of accounts payable and $656,000 of 
notes payable, the issuance of a promissory note for $953,000, 
the issuance of 300,000 shares of the Company common stock 
valued at fair market value of $3125 per share and warrants to 
purchase an aggregate of 300,000 shares of the Company common 
stock at prices of $300, $400 and $500 per share, respectively, 
for each 100,000 shares. These warrants were valued at 
$13,000, which represents the excess of the fair market value of 
the common stock over the exercise price on the date of issuance. 
The warrants vest immediately and expire in three years Note 20. In November 1995, STC completed its acquisition of 
substantially all of the assets of PTC Cellular, Inc. PTCC. The 
purchase price was $3,725,000, comprised of $300,000 in cash, the 
assumption of $1,200,000 of accounts payable, the issuance of a 
promissory note of $2,000,000 and the issuance of 100,000 
shares of the Company common stock valued at fair market value 
of $225 per share.  In May 1995, the Company commenced management of, and 
subsequently acquired the outstanding capital stock of, Cellular 
Hotline, Inc. Hotline, a cellular telephone activation service 
provider. The purchase price was $1,329,000, comprised of 
$217,000 in cash, the assumption of $712,000 of accounts payable, 
the issuance of a promissory note of $150,000 and the balance 
through the issuance of 50,000 shares of the Company common 
stock Shares valued at fair market value of $500 per share. 
The former Hotline stockholders had the right to require the 
Company to repurchase all or a portion of the Shares for $500 per 
share. In September 1995, the former Hotline stockholders 
exercised their put option and the Company purchased 
all the Shares and subsequently retired them. In connection with 
the acquisition, the Company issued the former Hotline 
stockholders a three-year option to purchase an aggregate of 
50,000 shares of the Company common stock at a price of $750 
per share. NOTE 4 - 	Acquisitions Continued These acquisitions were accounted for as purchases, and the

NOTE 11 Stockholders' Equity The Company has reserved for issuance 3,518,000 shares of its 
common stock relating to common stock purchase warrants 
outstanding as of December 31, 1997 at exercise prices ranging 
from $275 to $709. In August and September 1997, the Company sold an aggregate 
of 406,667 units, at $300 per unit, through a private placement 
that included various members of the Company management. Each 
unit consists of one share of common stock and one warrant to 
purchase one share of common stock at $300 per share. 
During December 1996, the Company entered into an agreement to 
sell an aggregate of 500,000 units, at $300 per unit, through a 
private placement. In December 1996, 250,000 units were sold, and 
the remaining 250,000 units were sold in January 1997.  In August 1996, the Company certificate of incorporation 
was amended whereby the authorized number of shares of the 
Company common stock was increased to 20,000,000. In addition, 
the Company was authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred 
stock at $01 par value, issuable from time to time in one or more 
series with such rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions 
as determined by the Board of Directors. In August 1996, the Company sold 500,000 shares of Series B 
Convertible Preferred Stock Series B for $10 per share through a 
private placement, including 250,000 shares purchased by its 
former parent, Shared Technologies Fairchild Inc. STFI. Each 
share of Series B was convertible into a minimum of 250 shares 
and a maximum of 333 shares of the Company common stock, 
subject to certain adjustments, and pays no dividends. During 
1997, the Series B stockholders converted their shares into an 
aggregate of 1,667,000 shares of the Company common stock. Upon 
conversion of the Series B shares, the holders received one 
warrant per common share to purchase an additional share of the 
Company common stock at an exercise price of $300 per share. 
In addition, in 1996, the Company paid an advisory fee of $125,000 
and issued warrants to purchase 240,000 shares of common stock, at 
an exercise price of $300 per share. The advisory firm in which 
two of its principals are directors of the Company, was a party to 
the sale of 250,000 shares of Series B.
NOTE 11 -	Stockholders' Equity Continued In December 1995, the Company sold 300,000 shares of Series A 
Convertible Preferred Stock Series A at $10 per share through a 
private placement. Each preferred stockholder was entitled to 
receive dividends equal to 10% per annum per share for the first 
twelve month period, payable in additional shares of Series A. 
For 1995, the dividend applicable to these shares, and the impact 
on the loss to the common stockholders, were deemed to be 
insignificant. The Company paid an advisory fee of $300,000 and 
issued warrants to purchase 150,000 shares of common stock, at an 
exercise price of $250, to a firm in which two of its principals 
are directors of the Company. During 1996, the Series A 
stockholders converted all their shares, including 11,000 shares 
received as dividends, into 1,147,000 shares of the Company 
common stock. In June 1995, in connection with a consulting agreement, the 
Company issued warrants to purchase 95,000 shares of its common 
stock, at an exercise price of $600 per share, subject to certain 
anti-dilution provisions. In May 1995, the Company purchased 31,000 shares of its 
common stock for $125,000 from a consultant and subsequently 
retired the shares. In April 1995, the Company completed its initial public 
offering of 950,000 shares of its common stock at $525 per share. In March 1995, the Board of Directors adopted a resolution to 
effect a reverse stock split of two for three. Accordingly, all 
number of shares and per share data presented in these 
consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect 
this reverse stock split.
NOTE 12 - 	Stock Option Plans The Board of Directors adopted, and the Company 
stockholders approved, a stock option plan the Plan pursuant to 
which 525,000 shares of the Company common stock were reserved 
for issuance upon the exercise of options granted to officers, 
employees, consultants and directors of the Company. 
Options issued under the Plan are nonqualified stock options 
NSO and the Board of Directors Committee will grant NSO at 
an exercise price which is not less than the fair market value on 
the date such options are granted. The Plan further 
provides that the maximum period in which stock options may be 
exercised will be determined by the Committee, except that they 
may not be exercisable after ten years from the date of grant. At 
December 31, 1997, options to purchase 339,000 shares of common 
stock are outstanding.
The Board of Directors adopted, and the stockholders approved, the 
Company 1994 Director Option Plan the Director Plan pursuant 
to which 33,000 shares of the Company common stock are reserved 
for issuance upon the exercise of options to be granted to non-
employee directors of the Company. Under the Director Plan, an 
eligible director will automatically receive, at the commencement 
of the Director one year term, nonstatutory options to purchase 
2,000 shares of the Company common stock at an exercise price 
equal to the fair market value of such shares at the time of 
grant.  Each such option is immediately exercisable within the 
ten years from the date of grant, but generally may not be 
exercised more than 90 days after the date the director 
ceases to serve as a director of the Company. At December 31, 
1997, options to purchase 26,000 shares of the Company common 
stock were outstanding under the Director Plan. The activity in the Plan and the Director
Plan are as follows Exercise Price Per Share

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS No. 
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. The Company 
applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related 
interpretations in accounting for its plans. Had 
compensation cost for the Company stock-based compensation plans 
been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates, 
consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company net loss and loss per 
share would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated 
below          1997    1996     1995

loss per 
common share:
As reported       $063   $218   $104
Pro forma        $064   $219   $104 The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date 
of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the 
following weighted average assumptions used for grants in 1997, 
1996 and 1995, respectively: risk-free interest rate of 6%; no 
dividend yield; expected lives of 3 to 10 years; and expected 
volatility of 64%, 62% and 62%, respectively.
NOTE 13 - 	Related Party Transactions The Company entered into an agreement, effective January 1, 
1996, to pay a fee of $25,000 per month not to exceed $200,000 
annually, for certain services to be performed by STFI. The fee 
is not payable in any month in which there is a pre-tax loss and 
cannot exceed pre-tax profit prior to the fee. No payments 
were due under the agreement for the years ended December 31, 1997 
and 1996. In addition, STFI agrees to provide telecommunications 
services, as may be requested, including local access and long 
distance service, at a price not to exceed STFI cost for such 
services plus 20%. This agreement is cancelable by the Company on 
thirty days notice to STFI. Amounts due to former parent are due on demand, unsecured and 
noninterest-bearing.
NOTE 14 -	Loss on Discontinued Product Line During 1997, the Company completed the transition of the 
existing in-car rental accounts to portable rentals. In 
conjunction with this transition, the Company attempted to develop 
alternate uses for the in-car cellular telephones as well as the 
capitalized software associated with the in-car cellular rental 
business. Although management believes that there are viable uses 
for such assets, the probability that such uses will be successful 
is not known. As a result, the Company reduced the in-car 
cellular phones and the capitalized software to net realizable 
value and classified them on the balance sheet as assets held for 
disposition.
NOTE 15 -	Savings and Retirement Plan In June 1996, the Company formed a savings and retirement 
plan the Plan, which covers substantially all eligible 
employees. Participants in the Plan may elect to make 
contributions up to a maximum of 20% of their compensation. For 
each participant, the Company will make a matching contribution of 
one-half of the participant contributions, up to 5% of the 
participant compensation. Matching contributions may be made in 
the form of the Company common stock and are vested at the rate 
of 33% per year. Prior to the formation of the Plan, the 
Company participated in a plan maintained by STFI. Matching 
contributions in STFI plan were made in STFI common stock. For 
the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, the Company 
matching contributions were $71,000, $40,000 and $25,000, 
respectively. NOTE 16 - Income Taxes A reconciliation of income tax

deferred tax assets of approximately $5,511,000 and $4,400,000, 
respectively, and valuation allowances in the same amounts. The 
valuation allowances were increased by $1,111,000, $3,296,000 and 
$994,000, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 1997, 
1996 and 1995. SFAS No. 109 requires that the Company record a 
valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some 
portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
The ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset depends on the 
Company ability to generate sufficient taxable income. NOTE 16 - Income Taxes Continued The net deferred tax assets and
liabilities as of December 31, 1997
and 1996 are as follows:

utilized against future taxable income and expire through the year 
2012. Net operating losses available for state income tax 
purposes are less than those for federal purposes and 
generally expire earlier.
NOTE 17 - 	Commitments and Contingencies The Company leases office facilities, which expire in various 
years through December 2001. Future aggregate minimum annual 
rental payments as of December 31, 1997 are as follows Year Ending December 31
1998	$192,000
1999	 164,000
2000	 63,000
2001	 35,000 Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 
1995 was approximately $352,000, $418,000 and $256,000, 
respectively. The Company is a party to various legal actions, the outcome 
of which, in the opinion of management, will not have a material 
adverse effect on results of operations, cash flows or financial 
position of the Company.
NOTE 17 - 	Commitments and Contingencies Continued In October 1997, the Company entered into an agreement with a 
promotion company relating to the marketing of a certain product 
line. In addition to certain commission arrangements and upon 
obtaining specified sales levels, the Company has agreed to issue 
warrants to purchase shares of the Company common stock at $600 
per share. This agreement will remain in force for a two-year 
period with automatic renewal periods of one year unless 
terminated.
NOTE 18 - 	Dependence Upon Key Relationships and Major 
Customers Approximately 26%, 24%, 13% and 11% of the Company revenues 
for 1997 were attributable to Thorn Americas, Inc. a national 
retailer, Hertz Corporation Hertz, Avis Rent-A-Car Systems, 
Inc. Avis and National Car Rental System, Inc. National, 
respectively. Approximately 21%, 16% and 13% of the Company 
revenues for 1996 and 14%, 0%, and 11% of the Company 
revenues for 1995 were attributable to Hertz, Avis and National, 
respectively. The agreements with these companies are terminable 
with cause and require written notification, typically effective 
upon relatively short notice. The termination of any one of these 
agreements would have a material adverse effect on the Company.  NOTE 19 - 	Loss on Contract Cancellation In 1996, in connection with the transition of the In-Car 
cellular phone service to portable rentals, the Company recognized 
a loss of approximately $980,000 relating to the cancellation of a 
certain contract for the production of certain in-car 
telecommunications equipment.
NOTE 20 -	Subsequent Event In March 1998, the Company and Summit reached an agreement in 
principle whereby the Company will receive from Summit 100,000 
shares of the Company common stock, previously issued in 
connection with the acquisition Note 4. The stock received is 
in exchange for the payment by the Company of $150,000 to 
a vendor on behalf of Summit, a one year extension of the 
expiration date of the warrants issued in connection with the 
acquisition, additional warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of the 
Company common stock at a price of $500 per share, and 
forgiveness of all amounts due, including accrued interest, on the 
note receivable. VALUATION AND
