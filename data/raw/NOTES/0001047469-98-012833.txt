1 During the period from the inception of the Company through the
consummation of its initial public offering in March 1994, the Company was
treated for income tax purposes as an S corporation under Subchapter S of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and under comparable tax
laws of certain states. As a result, earnings of the Company during that
period were taxed for federal and certain state income tax purposes
directly to the Company stockholders, rather than to the Company. Upon
the termination of the Company S corporation status, in addition to
becoming subject to corporate tax at the federal level and in a number of
states, the Company was required to provide for deferred federal and state
income taxes, calculated in accordance with the Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement 109, Accounting for Income Taxes FAS 109,
for the cumulative temporary differences between the financial reporting
and income tax bases of the Company assets and liabilities, resulting in
a charge to the provision for income taxes in the amount of $1,213,000 in
1994. See Note 12 of the Notes to Financial Statements.
2 The Company used a portion of its net proceeds from the initial public
offering to prepay the $12,000,000 in principal of the Company 1088%
Senior Secured Notes and related accrued interest of $653,000. This
prepayment resulted in an extraordinary after tax loss of $1,160,000, net
of related income tax benefit of                      -12   $710,000. The gross extraordinary loss included a prepayment penalty of
$1,728,000 and the write-off of unamortized deferred loan costs of
$142,000. 
3 The actual and pro forma net income per share data is based on the
historical weighted average number of shares outstanding, as adjusted to
reflect i a Common Stock split of 508-for-one in connection with a
reincorporation merger transaction completed in January 1994, ii the
3-for-2 split of the Common Stock effected on March 5, 1995, and iii the
3-for-2 split of the Common Stock effected on December 5, 1995. In
addition, the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to compute
earnings per share as of December 31, 1993, has been adjusted to include
the estimated number of shares 464,000 shares as calculated at the initial
public offering price and prior to adjustment for the stock dividends paid
in 1995 required to be sold by the Company to pay, as of December 31,
1993, the distribution made to the Company S corporation stockholders
upon the consummation of the initial public offering. See Note 3 of the
Notes to Financial Statements.
4 The pro forma statement of income data for 1993 and 1994 is based on
historical net income, as adjusted to reflect a provision for income taxes
at an assumed effective rate of 38%, as if the Company had been a C
corporation since its inception. The pro forma statement of income data
was calculated using the criteria established under FAS 109, which requires
the use of an asset and liability approach to financial reporting and
accounting for income taxes. The 1994 pro forma provision for income taxes
does not include the $1,213,000 charge related to the Company termination
of its S corporation status as discussed in note 1 above. See Note 12 of
the Notes to Financial Statements.
Item 7     Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is
qualified in its entirety by, the Financial Statements and the Notes thereto and
Selected Financial Data included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Historical
operating results and percentage relationships among any amounts included in the
Financial Statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating
results for any future period.
Overview
The Company core business is the manufacture and sale of high quality, 
precision steel balls and rollers. In 1997, balls accounted for 
approximately 92% of the Company net sales, while rollers accounted for the 
remaining 8%. Although all of the Company net sales from 1980 through 1986 
were exclusively to domestic customers, the Company international sales 
have increased significantly since then and represented approximately 47% of 
net sales in 1997. See Note 11 of the Notes to Financial Statements. Sales 
declined in 1997, primarily due to reduced international sales. 
Significant factors in the Company growth since its founding include its
displacement of captive ball manufacturing divisions of domestic and
international bearing manufacturers as a source of precision balls and increased
sales of high precision balls for quiet bearing applications. From 1992 through
1997, the percentage of high precision balls produced by the Company for use in
quiet bearing applications has increased from approximately 54% to approximately
81% of total net ball sales. Management believes that the Company sales
growth since 1992 is due to its ability to capitalize on opportunities in
overseas markets and provide precision balls at competitive prices, as well as
its emphasis on product quality and customer service. The sales decline in 1997
was due in large part to economic conditions in Europe and Asia and a decline in
outsourcing by certain captive producers.                     -13 Results of Operations

Year Ended December 31, 1997 Compared in the Year Ended December 31, 1996
Net Sales. The Company net sales decreased $93 million, or 110%, from
$845 million in 1996 to $753 million in 1997. Foreign net sales decreased
$72 million, or 171%, from $421 million in 1996 to $349 million in 1997. 
The decrease in foreign net sales was due primarily to decreased sales volumes
with existing customers, largely because of a decline in outsourcing of captive
production by certain of the Company customers including, as previously
announced by the Company, one of the Company major customers bringing in house
a portion of its business that was previously outsourced to the Company and
general economic conditions in Europe and Asia. Domestic net sales decreased
$21 million, or 50%, from $424 million in 1996 to $403 million in 1997. 
This decrease was primarily due to decreased sales to existing customers. 
Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased by $43 million, or 154% from $278
million in 1996 to $235 million in 1997. As a percentage of net sales, gross
profit decreased from 329% in 1996 to 313% in 1997. The decrease in gross
profit is due largely to costs related to the new facility start-up in Ireland
and costs associated with excess capacity resulting from decreased sales to some
existing customers.                     -14   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased by $628,000, or 128% to $55 million from
$49 million in 1996. This increase is due primarily to increased legal,
accounting and employee relocation expenses related to the Ireland facility
start-up, as well as increased consulting expenses related to the Company
current strategic development process. As a percentage of net sales, selling,
general and administrative expenses increased to 73% in 1997 from 58% in 1996.
Depreciation Expense. Depreciation expense increased $748,000, or 223 to $41 million in 1997 from $34 million in 1996. This increase was due
primarily to capital expenditures associated with expansion of the Company
existing facilities and the start-up of the Ireland facility. Also, new assets
added in 1996 related to the Mountain City facility were depreciated utilizing
the half-year convention in the prior year versus a full year of depreciation
taken in the current year. As a percentage of net sales, depreciation increased
to 55% in 1997 from 40% in 1996.
Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $267,000, or 902%, from
$296,000 in 1996 to $29,000 in 1997. The decrease was due to decreased levels
outstanding under the Company line of credit in 1997 as compared to 1996. See
Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition -- Liquidity and
Capital Resources.
Net Income. Net income decreased $40 million, or 317% from $125 million
in 1996 to $85 million in 1997. As a percentage of net sales, net income
decreased to 113% in 1997 from 147% in 1996. The decrease in net income as a
percentage of net sales was due primarily to costs associated with the new
Ireland facility start-up, excess capacity at the Company plants, increased
selling, general and administrative expenses and the increase depreciation
expense discussed above. In addition, the Company increased the provision for
income taxes due to the decrease in foreign sales as a percentage of total sales
and the anticipated decrease in the level of tax benefit from the Company
participation in a shared foreign sales corporation.
Year Ended December 31, 1996 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 1995.
Net Sales. The Company net sales increased by $67 million, or 87%, to
$845 million in 1996 from $778 million in 1995. Foreign net sales increased
$36 million, or 94%, to $421 million in 1996 from $385 million in 1995. The
increase in foreign net sales was due primarily to increased sales volumes with
existing customers, and to a lesser extent, sales to several new customers. 
Domestic net sales increased $31 million, or 80%, to $424 million in 1996
from $393 million in 1995. This increase was due primarily to increased sales
to existing customers. Notwithstanding the Company record sales in 1996, the
Company foreign sales in the last half of 1996 were negatively affected by
weak international economies, certain customers' excess inventories and a
slowing in the overall rate of outsourcing of captive production. The Company
anticipates that its foreign sales will continue to be affected by one or more
of these negative factors in 1997. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 1996,
two of the Company major customers have informed the Company of their
intention to bring in-house in 1997 a portion of their business in the
aggregate, approximately $90 million in net sales that was previously
outsourced to the Company. Management anticipates that the loss of these sales
in 1997 should be offset, at least partially, by additional sales to other
existing customers.
Gross Profit. Gross profit increased by $39 million, or 163%, to $278
million in 1996 from $239 million in 1995. As a percentage of net sales, gross
profit increased to 329% in 1996 from 307% in 1995. During 1995, gross profit
was adversely affected as a result of increased raw material costs resulting
from a steel shortage and inefficiencies associated with the steel shortage and
capacity constraints, including increased labor and transportation costs. 
During the first quarter of 1996, the steel shortage abated and, in addition,
the Company brought additional capacity on-line with the addition of the
Mountain City, Tennessee facility which allowed for more efficient operations. 
During the third quarter of 1996, the Company implemented a new financial
reporting software package which allowed for more efficient tracking and
controlling of costs. Additionally, during 1996, the Company recorded
approximately $700,000 of duty drawback associated with 1995 and 1996 imports of
raw material which had not been previously recorded. This amount is an offset
to export fees paid.                     -15   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased by $641,000 or 151%, to $49 million from
$42 million in 1995. The increase was due primarily to increased salaries and
wages. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative
expenses increased slightly to 58% in 1996 from 55% in 1995.
Depreciation Expense. Depreciation expense increased $994,000, or 420 to $34 million in 1996 from $24 million in 1995. This increase was due
primarily to capital expenditures associated with the expansion of the Company
facilities and purchases of equipment. As a percentage of sales, depreciation
increased to 40% in 1996 from 30% in 1995.
Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $254,000, or 6048%, to
$296,00 in 1996 from $42,000 in 1995. This increase was due to increased levels
outstanding under the Company line of credit in 1996 compared to 1995.
Net Income. Net income increased $954,000, or 83%, to $125 million in
1996 from $115 million in 1995. As a percentage of net sales, net income
decreased slightly to 147% in 1996 from 148% in 1995.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
In July 1997, the Company terminated its $100 million revolving credit facility
and entered into a loan agreement with First American National Bank First
American. This loan agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up
to $25 million, which will expire June 30, 2000.
Amounts outstanding under the revolving facility are unsecured and bear interest
at a floating rate equal to, at the Company option, either LIBOR plus 065% or
the Fed Funds effective rate plus 15%. The loan agreement contains customary
financial and operating restrictions on the Company, including covenants
restricting the Company, without First American consent, from incurring
additional indebtedness from, or pledging any of its assets to, other lenders
and from disposing of a substantial portion of its assets. In addition, the
Company is prohibited from declaring any dividend if a default exists under the
revolving credit facility at the time of, or would occur as a result of, such a
declaration. The loan agreement also prohibits sales of property outside of the
ordinary course of business. The loan agreement contains financial covenants
with respect to the Company, including a covenant that the Company earnings
will not decrease in any year by more than fifty percent of earnings in the
Company immediately preceding fiscal year. The Company, as of March 25, 1998,
was in compliance with all such covenants. The Company arrangements with its domestic customers typically provide that
payments are due within 30 days following the date of the Company shipment of
goods, while arrangements with foreign customers other than foreign customers
that have entered into an inventory management program with the Company
generally provide that payments are due within either 90 or 120 days following
the date of shipment. Under the Company inventory management program,
payments typically are due within 30 days after the product is used by the
customer. The Company has developed a presence in foreign markets, and to the
extent foreign sales increase, management believes that the Company working
capital requirements will increase as a result of longer payment terms provided
to foreign customers. The Company net sales historically have not been of a
seasonal nature. However, as foreign sales have increased as a percentage of
total sales, seasonality has become a factor for the Company in that many
foreign customers cease production during the month of August.
In the fourth quarter of 1997, upon the commencement of production in its
Kilkenny, Ireland facility, the Company began to bill and receive payment from
some of its foreign customers in their own currency. To date, the Company has
not been materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations or foreign
exchange restrictions. Nonetheless, as a result of these sales, the Company
foreign exchange risk has increased. Various strategies to manage this risk are
under development and implementation, including a hedging program. In addition,
a strengthening of the US dollar against foreign currencies could impair the                      -16 ability of the Company to compete with international based competitors for 
foreign as well as domestic sales. 
Working capital, which consists principally of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable and inventories, was $187 million at December 31, 1997, as
compared to $184 million at December 31, 1996. The ratio of current assets to
current liabilities increased slightly to 35:1 at December 31, 1997 from 32:1
at December 31, 1996. Cash flow from operations increased to $141 during 1997
from $127 million during 1996. 
During 1998, the Company plans to spend approximately $9 million on capital
expenditures, including the purchase of additional machinery and equipment for
all four of the Company facilities. The Company intends to finance these
activities with cash generated from operations and funds available under the
credit facility described above. The Company believes that funds generated from
operations and borrowings from the credit facility will be sufficient to finance
the Company working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements in
1998.
In December 1996, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized
the repurchase of up to 731,462 shares of the Company Common Stock, equaling
5% of the Company issued and outstanding shares as of November 11, 1996. The
Company did not purchase any shares under this program during 1996. In February
1997, the Company repurchased 86,000 shares at an aggregate purchase price of
$999,750. In September 1997, the Company repurchased 100,000 shares at an
aggregate purchase price of $1,125,000. The repurchase program is no longer in
effect.
Seasonality and Fluctuation in Quarterly Results
The Company net sales historically have not been of a seasonal nature. 
However, as foreign sales have increased as a percentage of total sales,
seasonality has become a factor for the Company in that many foreign customers
cease production during the month of August. For information concerning the
Company quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 1997
and 1996, see Note 15 of the Notes to Financial Statements.
Inflation and Changes in Prices
While the Company operations have not been affected by inflation 
during recent years, prices for 52100 Steel and other raw materials purchased 
by the Company are subject to change. For example, during 1995, due to an 
increase in worldwide demand for 52100 Steel and the decrease in the value of 
the United States dollar relative to foreign currencies, the Company 
experienced an increase in the price of 52100 Steel and some difficulty in 
obtaining an adequate supply of 52100 Steel from its existing suppliers. See 
Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations --Liquidity and Capital Resources. Typically, the Company 
pricing arrangements with its steel suppliers are subject to adjustment once 
every six months. In an effort to limit its exposure to fluctuations in 
steel prices, the Company has generally avoided the use of long-term, fixed 
price contracts with its customers. Instead, the Company typically reserves 
the right to increase product prices periodically in the event of increases 
in its raw material costs. The Company was able to minimize the impact on its 
operations resulting from the 52100 Steel price increases by taking such 
measures. See Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations --Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Cautionary Statements for Purposes of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
The Company wishes to caution that this report and the 1997 Annual Report
to Stockholders contain, and future filings by the Company, press releases and
oral statements made by the Company authorized representatives may contain,
forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. The
Company actual results could differ materially from those expressed in such
forward looking statements due to important factors bearing on the Company
business, many of which are discussed elsewhere in this filing and in the
Company prior filings. The following paragraphs discuss the risk factors that
the Company regards as the most significant, although the                      -17 Company wishes to caution that other factors that currently are not considered
significant or that currently cannot be foreseen may in the future prove to be
important in affecting the Company results of operations. The Company
undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Industry Risks. The precision ball and roller industry is cyclical and
tends to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production. The
Company sales could be negatively affected by adverse conditions in the
industrial production sector of the economy or by adverse global or national
economic conditions generally. 
Competition. The precision ball and roller market is highly competitive,
and many of the ball and roller manufacturers in the market are larger and have
substantially greater resources than the Company. The Company competitors are
continuously exploring and implementing improvements in technology and
manufacturing processes in order to improve product quality, and the Company
ability to remain competitive will depend, among other things, on whether it is
able, in a cost effective manner, to keep apace with such quality improvements. 
In addition, the Company competes with many of its customers that, in addition
to producing bearings, also internally produce balls and rollers for sale to
third parties. The Company also faces a risk that its customers will decide to
produce balls and rollers internally rather than outsourcing their needs to the
Company.
Rapid Growth. The Company has undergone rapid growth over the last several
years. Accordingly, the Company risks underutilization or inefficient
utilization of its production facilities in future years. The Company also
faces risks associated with start-up expenses, inefficiencies, delays and
increased depreciation costs associated with its new facilities in Mountain 
City, Tennessee, in Kilkenny, Ireland and with its plant expansions. The 
Company currently is not operating at full capacity and faces risks of further
under-utilization or inefficient utilization of its production facilities in
future years.
Raw Material Shortages. Because the balls and rollers manufactured by the
Company have highly-specialized applications, their production requires the use
of very particular types of steel. Due to quality constraints in the United
States, the Company obtains the vast majority of its steel from overseas
suppliers. Steel shortages or transportation problems, particularly with
respect to 52100 Steel, could have a detrimental effect on the Company
business. See Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources. 
Risks Associated with International Trade. Because the Company obtains a
majority of its raw materials from overseas suppliers and sells to a large
number of international customers, the Company faces risks associated with i
adverse foreign currency fluctuations, ii changes in trade, monetary and
fiscal policies, laws and regulations, and other activities of governments,
agencies and similar organizations, iii the imposition of trade restrictions
or prohibitions, iv the imposition of import or other charges or taxes, and
v unstable governments or legal systems in countries in which the Company
suppliers and customers are located. See Management Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital
Resources and Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations -- Inflation and Changes in Prices. In the fourth
quarter of 1997, Company began accepting payment in foreign currency from
foreign customers. In addition, an increase in the value of the United States
dollar relative to foreign currencies may adversely affect the ability of the
Company to compete with its foreign-based competitors for international as well
as domestic sales to the extent payments are made in United States dollars.
Dependence on Major Customers. During 1997, the Company ten largest
customers accounted for approximately 77% of its net sales. Sales to various
U.S. and foreign divisions of SKF, which is one of the largest bearing
manufacturers in the world, accounted for approximately 37% of net sales in
1997, and sales to FAG accounted for approximately 10% of net sales in 1997. 
The Company currently negotiates and contracts with various purchasing units
within SKF and believes that, in certain respects, such units operate
independently with respect to purchasing decisions. There can be no assurance,
however, that SKF will not centralize purchasing decisions in the                      -18 future. None of the Company other customers accounted for more than 10% of
its net sales in 1997, but sales to two of its customers each represented more
than 5% of the Company 1997 net sales. The loss of all or a substantial
portion of sales to these customers would have a material adverse effect on the
Company business.
Item 4     Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
No matters were submitted for a vote of stockholders during the fourth

In our opinion, the financial statements listed in the accompanying index 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of NN Ball & 
Roller, Inc. and its subsidiary at December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the 
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years 
in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of 
the Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of 
these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards 
which required that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing 
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management 
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that 
our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. PRICE WATERHOUSE LLP Winston-Salem, North Carolina

NOTE 1 - THE COMPANY AND ITS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
NN Ball & Roller, Inc. the Company is a manufacturer of balls and rollers 
used primarily in the bearing industry. The Company has manufacturing 
facilities in Tennessee and South Carolina. During 1997, the Company opened 
NN Ball & Roller, Ltd., an operating facility in Kilkenny, Ireland. The 
Company sells to both foreign and domestic customers See Note 11.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity 
of three months or less as cash equivalents.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined 
using the first-in, first-out method.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals 
and betterments are capitalized. When a major property item is retired, its 
cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from 
the property accounts and any gain or loss is recorded in income or expense.
Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the 
estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets for financial reporting 
purposes. Accelerated depreciation methods are used for income tax purposes.
Revenue recognition
The Company generally recognizes a sale when goods are shipped and ownership 
is assumed by the customer. The Company has implemented an inventory 
management program for certain major customers. Under this program, sales are 
recognized when products are used by the customer from consigned stock, 
instead of at the time of shipment. Inventory on consignment at December 31, 
1997 and 1996 was approximately $2,431,000 and $2,610,000, respectively.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are provided based upon income reported for financial statement 
purposes. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of temporary 
differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of the 
Company assets and liabilities See Note 12.
Historical net income per common share
Earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the actual number of 
common shares outstanding during the year. Additionally, earnings per share 
assuming dilution is calculated in the same manner with the addition of 
dilutive common share equivalents See Note 13. The dilutive effect of stock 
options is computed using the treasury stock method. The fully dilutive 
effect of the Company stock options results in no impact on earnings per 
share for any period presented and thus has been omitted from these financial 
statements.                     -26 NN Ball & Roller, Inc.
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995
- 
Stock incentive plan
The Company uses the intrinsic value method to account for employee stock 
options. Accordingly, under this method, the Company has not recorded 
compensation expense related to the options Note 9. The exercise price of 
each option equals the market price of the Company stock on the date of 
grant.
Principles of consolidation
The Company financial statements include the accounts of NN Ball & Roller, 
Inc. and its subsidiary NN Ball & Roller, Ltd. All intercompany accounts and 
investments in subsidiaries are eliminated upon consolidation.
Foreign currency translation
Assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiary are translated at 
current exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are translated at average 
rates prevailing during the year. Cumulative translation adjustments are 
reported as a separate component of stockholder equity.
Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and 
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates. NOTE 2 - CAPITAL CHANGES
On May 2, 1996, the stockholders approved an increase in the number of 
authorized common shares from 20,000,000 to 45,000,000. No change was made to 
the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock.
NOTE 3 - STOCK SPLITS
On February 9, 1995, the Company Board of Directors authorized a 
three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend 
payable on March 5, 1995 to stockholders of record on February 27, 1995. This 
resulted in the issuance of approximately 3,216,000 additional shares of 
common stock.
On November 13, 1995, the Company Board of Directors authorized a 
three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend 
payable on December 5, 1995 to stockholders of record on November 27, 1995. 
This resulted in the issuance of approximately 4,825,000 additional shares of 
common stock. Unless otherwise stated, all references in the financial 
statements to stock option data, per share and weighted average share amounts 
have been restated to reflect these stock splits.                     -27 NN Ball & Roller, Inc.

NOTE 7-SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES
Effective July 1997, the Company terminated a revolving line of credit with 
NationsBank of Tennessee, N.A., which consisted of a $10,000,000 line of 
credit of which $2,308,000 was outstanding at December 31, 1996, at an 
interest rate of 725%, and entered a similar agreement with First American 
National Bank. Under the new agreement, the Company may borrow up to 
$25,000,000 through June 30,2000. Amounts outstanding under the agreement 
are unsecured and are subject to interest charges of the LIBOR rate plus 65% 
or the Federal Funds effective rate plus 15%, according to the Company 
option. There was $1,480,000 outstanding at December 31, 1997 at an interest 
rate of 6615%. The agreement contains restrictive covenants which specify, 
among other things, restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness and the 
maintenance of certain working capital requirements. The Company was in 
compliance with such covenants at December 31, 1997.
Interest paid during 1997, 1996 and 1995 was $28,000, $321,000 and $15,000, 
respectively. NOTE 8-EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has defined contribution 401k profit sharing plan the Plan 
covering substantially all employees who have one year of service, have 
attained age twenty-one and have elected to participate in the Plan. A 
participant may elect to contribute from 1% to 20% of his or her compensation

December 31, 1997.  146,012
On May 6, 1996 and July 31, 1997, one of the Company officers exercised 
approximately 150,000 and 358,000 stock options, respectively. The exercise 
price and the market price of the options at the date of exercise were $622 
and $2550 for 1996 and $622 and $1250 for 1997, respectively. Certain of 
these options were considered non qualified options and, accordingly, the 
Company recorded compensation expense, for income tax purposes only, of 
approximately $1,967,000 in 1996 and $2,150,000 in 1997. The reduction in 
taxes payable of approximately $686,000 in 1996 and $789,000 in 1997 was 
recorded as additional paid-in capital in the accompanying financial 
statements.
All options granted in the period January 1, 1995 through December 31, 
1997 vest 20% annually, beginning one year from date of grant. The exercise 
price of each option equals the market price of the Company stock on the 
date of grant, and an option maximum term is 10 years. During 1996, the 
Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123. SFAS 123 
encourages but does not require a fair value based method of accounting for
