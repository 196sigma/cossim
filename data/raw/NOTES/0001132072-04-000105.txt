the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of LeCroy

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
ORGANIZATION
LeCroy Corporation the Company or LeCroy, was founded and incorporated
in the State of New York in 1964 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware in
1995. The Company develops, manufactures, sells and licenses oscilloscopes and
related test and measurement equipment. Oscilloscopes are tools used by
designers and engineers to measure and analyze complex electronic signals in
order to develop high-performance systems, to validate electronic designs and to
improve time to market. The Company products are sold into a broad range of
end markets, including the computer and semiconductor, data storage devices,
automotive and industrial, and military and aerospace markets. Revenues are also
generated from the sale of probes, accessories, and applications solutions, and
to a lesser extent, extended warranty contracts and repairs and calibrations
performed on instruments after the expiration of their warranties.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND USE OF ESTIMATES
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of LeCroy and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to
prior-year amounts to conform to the current-year presentation.
The Company consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions. These
estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and the revenues and expenses reported during
the period. The most significant of these estimates and assumptions relate to
the allowance for doubtful accounts, allowance for excess and obsolete
inventory, warranty accrual, stock-based compensation, intangible asset
valuation, determining if and when impairments have occurred, and the assessment
of the valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax reserves. These
estimates and assumptions are based on management judgment and available
information and, consequently, actual results could differ from these estimates.
FISCAL YEAR ENDING DATES
The Company fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to June 30 June 26,
2004, June 28, 2003 and June 29, 2002. Each of these fiscal years represented a
52-week period. For clarity of presentation, the consolidated financial
statement year-end references are stated as June 30.
REVENUE
Revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue, net of allowances for
anticipated returns, provided that 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists 2 delivery has occurred 3 the selling price is fixed or determinable
and 4 collection is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have
occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer, or when
services have been provided. The price is considered fixed or determinable when
it is not subject to refund or adjustments.
The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts relating to
accounts receivable estimated to be non-collectible. The Company analyzes
historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness,
current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating
the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.                    45                LeCROY CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
Product revenue. The Company generates product revenues from the sales of
oscilloscopes, probes, accessories and application solutions. Application
solutions, which provide the oscilloscope with additional analysis capabilities,
are either delivered via compact disc read-only memory or are already loaded in
the oscilloscope and activated via a key code after the sale is made to the
customer for such application solution. All sales of these related products are
based upon separately established prices for these items and are recorded as
revenue according to the above revenue recognition criteria. No post-contract
support is provided on the application solutions. Revenues from these related
products are included in revenues from oscilloscopes and related products on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Software is embedded in the Company
oscilloscopes, but the software component is considered incidental.
License revenue. The Company recognizes software license revenue in
accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of
Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2, as amended by
Statement of Position 98-9, Modifications of SOP 97-2 with Respect to Certain
Transactions SOP 98-9. Revenues from perpetual software license agreements
are recognized upon delivery of the software if evidence of an arrangement
exists, pricing is fixed and determinable, and collectibility is probable. If an
acceptance period is required, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of
customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period. The Company
allocates revenue on software arrangements involving multiple elements to each
element based on the relative fair values of the elements. The determination of
fair value of each element in multiple element-arrangements is based on vendor
specific objective evidence VSOE. The Company analyzes all of the elements
and determines if there is sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue to maintenance
included in multiple element-arrangements. Accordingly, assuming all other
revenue recognition criteria are met, revenue is recognized upon delivery using
the residual method in accordance with SOP 98-9, where the fair value of the
undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement
fee is recognized as license revenue. The revenue allocated to software
maintenance is recognized ratably over the term of the support agreement. The
revenue allocated to licenses is recognized upon delivery of the licenses. The
revenue allocated to software maintenance is recognized ratably over the term of
the support agreement.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company licensed its proprietary
MAUI Instrument Operating System technology and recognized $30 million of
license revenue included in service and other revenue in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations. Maintenance fees post-contract support or PCS were
included in the agreement and are recognized pro rata for each year of
maintenance purchased. The only two elements in this agreement were the license
and the PCS. The Company recognizes revenue on the license, in accordance with
the contract, upon delivery of the source code. The Company pricing committee
established VSOE of fair value for the PCS prior to the sale of the software,
and accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue allocated to PCS ratably over
the term of the maintenance purchased. The Company did not recognize any
software license revenue during fiscal 2004 and 2002.
Service revenue. Service revenues include extended warranty contracts and
repairs and calibrations performed on instruments after the expiration of their
normal warranty period. The Company records deferred revenue for extended
warranty contracts and calibrations included within the sales contract
agreement. This deferred revenue is then recognized on a straight-line basis
over the related service period. When arrangements include multiple elements,
the Company uses relative fair values in accordance with Emerging Issues Task
Force EITF 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, to
allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for
revenue recognition have been met for each element.
Deferred revenue. During the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company
began shipping its new WaveSurfer family of oscilloscopes. One component of the
Company strategy for distributing this new family of oscilloscopes is the use
of a buy-sell distribution channel. This is the Company initial entry into
this distribution channel and because of the associated uncertainty about
sell-through volumes the Company has determined that it is only appropriate to
recognize revenue when the WaveSurfer is sold by the distributors to their
customers sell-through method. Until revenue is recognized, WaveSurfers
shipped to distributors are included in the Company finished goods inventory
and recorded in deferred revenue, included in accrued expenses and other
liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.                    46                LeCROY CORPORATION

SAB 101 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. Beginning in fiscal
2001 with the adoption of the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements, revenue from license fees under agreements that have exclusivity
clauses and, from the licensee perspective, have ongoing requirements or
expectations that are more than perfunctory, are recognized over the term of the
related agreements. An ongoing requirement or expectation would be considered
more than perfunctory if any party to the contract considers it to be essential
to the functionality of the delivered product or service or failure to complete
the activities would result in the customer receiving a full or partial refund
or rejecting the products delivered or services performed to date.
Under SAB 101 superseded by SAB 104, certain previously recognized
license fee revenue was deferred and recognized in future periods over the terms
of the agreements. The adoption of SAB 101 was recorded as of the beginning of
fiscal 2001 and resulted in a non-cash charge for the cumulative effect of an
accounting change of $44 million, net of a tax benefit of $27 million. The
deferred revenue is being amortized into revenue over 55 years, the remaining
terms of the license agreements. The Company recognized pretax license fee
revenue of $13 million during fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002. Such license
fees were included in service and other revenue in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations. As of June 30, 2004, the remaining deferred license fees balance
was $20 million.
STOCK - BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation plans under the
recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB No. 25, and related
interpretations. No compensation expense related to stock option plans is
reflected in the Company Consolidated Statements of Operations, as all options
granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant. Compensation cost for restricted
stock is recorded based on its market value on the date of grant and is included
in the Company Consolidated Statements of Operations ratably over the vesting
period. Upon the grant of restricted stock, deferred stock compensation is
recorded as an offset to additional paid-in capital and is amortized on a
straight-line basis as compensation expense over the vesting period.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income loss and net loss
per common share applicable to common stockholders as if the Company had applied
the fair value recognition provisions for stock-based employee compensation of

WARRANTY
The Company provides a warranty on its products, typically extending three
years after delivery and accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5,
Accounting for Contingencies. Estimated future warranty obligations related to
products are provided by charges to operations in the period that the related
revenue is recognized. These estimates are derived from historical data of
product reliability. The expected failure rate is arrived at in terms of units,
which are then converted into labor hours to which an average fully burdened
cost per hour is applied to derive the amount of accrued warranty required. On a
quarterly basis, the Company studies trends of warranty claims and performance
of specific products and adjusts its warranty obligation through charges or
credits to operations.
SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS
The Company records the costs and fees associated with transporting its
products to customers as a component of selling, general and administrative
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. These costs totaled $22
million, $21 million and $20 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.
ADVERTISING COSTS
The costs of general advertising, promotion and marketing programs are
charged to selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations in the fiscal year incurred. The costs of advertising
related to new product introductions are deferred until such advertising first
takes place, which generally coincides with product introduction. Advertising
expense for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $23
million, $24 million and $24 million, respectively.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash in excess of current operating requirements are invested in cash
equivalents, which are short-term, highly liquid interest bearing investments
with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and are stated
at cost, which approximates market value.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The Company investments in debt securities are classified as
available-for-sale and are reported at fair market value based on quoted market
prices. Unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, are reported as a component
of stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses on investments are included
in other income expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations when
realized. As of June 30, 2004, the Company had debt securities of $95 million,
net of an unrealized loss of $32,000. Management has the ability and intent, if
necessary, to liquidate any of these investments in order to meet its liquidity
needs within the normal operating cycle. Accordingly, all investments in debt
securities are classified as current assets.                    48

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the life of
the respective asset are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization of
property and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over the asset
estimated useful life or related lease term as follows  Building and    10-32 years
Furniture, machinery and equipment.    2-12 years
Computer software and hardware.    2-7 years
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
using the first-in, first-out method.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The Company monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate
carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets,
may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, the
Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether
the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted
expected future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the
carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying
amount exceeds the fair value.
GOODWILL
Goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business
combination. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually under a two-step
approach, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the asset might be impaired. Impairment is assessed at the reporting unit
level by applying a fair value-based test using the Company market
capitalization. The Company has one reporting unit for the purposes of SFAS No.
142.
The Company completed the annual impairment test required under SFAS No. 142
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 after completion of its annual
financial operating plan and determined that there was no impairment to its
recorded goodwill balance of $19 million at June 30, 2004. There were no
impairment indicators during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The Company develops, manufactures, sells and licenses oscilloscopes and
related test and measurement equipment. The Company products are sold into a
broad range of end markets, including the computer and semiconductor, data
storage devices, automotive and industrial, and military and aerospace markets.
Sales are to all regions of the United States as well as to a multitude of
foreign countries. Revenue derived from one customer, Iwatsu Electric Co.
Iwatsu, accounted for 11% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal
2002. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company
consolidated revenues in any of the last three fiscal years. There is no
significant concentration of the Company accounts receivable portfolio in any
customer or geographical region that presents a risk to the Company based on
that concentration. Credit losses have been minimal in fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002.
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of marketable securities,
foreign exchange forward contracts and short-term deposits in the United States
and Europe with major banks with investment levels and debt ratings set to limit
exposure with any one institution.                    49  INCOME TAXES
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized under the asset and
liability method based upon the difference between the amounts reported for
financial reporting and tax purposes. These deferred taxes are measured by
applying current enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period
that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided when it is
more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which related
temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled
reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax
planning strategies in making this assessment. The Company policy is not to
provide for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries to the
extent such earnings are determined to be permanently invested outside the
United States.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE
The Company foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as the
functional currency and translate all assets and liabilities at fiscal year end
exchange rates and all income and expenses at average fiscal year exchange rates
with translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income
loss, which is a separate component of stockholders' equity in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Transaction gains and losses that arise from
exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than
the functional currency are included in other income expense, net in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gains losses in fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002 resulting from foreign currency transactions, net of gains or losses on
related foreign exchange forward contracts, approximated $03 million, $04
million and $01 million, respectively. These net gains losses in fiscal
2004, 2003 and 2002 include gross gains of $05 million, $01 million and $02
million, respectively.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable,
accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities reported in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets equal or approximate their fair value due to their
short term to maturity.
The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the
risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations on assets or liabilities
denominated in other than the functional currency of the Company or its
subsidiaries. These foreign exchange forward contracts are not accounted for as
hedges in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Investments
and Hedging Activities; therefore, any changes in fair value of these contracts
are recorded in other income expense, net in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations. These foreign exchange forward contracts are recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. The changes in fair value of these
contracts are highly inversely correlated to changes in the value of certain of
the Company foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. At June 30,
2004 and June 30, 2003, the notional amounts of the Company open foreign
exchange forward contracts, all with maturities of less than six months, were
approximately $82 million and $67 million, respectively.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
Comprehensive income comprises of net income loss, foreign currency
translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities
classified as available-for-sale.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and
reporting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities under SFAS No.
133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This
statement clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net
investment meets the characteristic of a derivative discussed in SFAS No. 133,
clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component, conforms SFAS No.                    50
LeCROY CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
133 to language used in FASB Interpretation No. 45 and amends certain other
existing pronouncements. These changes are intended to result in more consistent
reporting of contracts as either derivatives or hybrid instruments. The
statement is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after,
and for hedging relationships designated after, June 30, 2003. The adoption of
this statement did not have an impact on the Company consolidated financial
statements.
In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150
establishes standards for classifying certain financial instruments that
represent obligations, yet also have characteristics similar to equity
instruments. Specifically, SFAS No. 150 addresses the accounting for instruments
such as mandatory redeemable securities, certain option contracts and
obligations to be settled in shares. SFAS No. 150 is effective for interim
periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of this statement did not
have an impact on the Company consolidated financial statements.
In March 2004, the FASB issued the exposure draft Share-Based Payment. The
proposed statement would require all equity-based awards to employees to be
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations based on their fair value
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2004. The new standard, if
accepted in its present form, would apply to all awards granted, modified or
settled after the effective date. The Company believes the adoption of this
proposed statement will have a material effect on its consolidated financial
position and results of operations.
2. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES CREDITS, NET
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company adopted a plan to
consolidate its probe development activities into its Chestnut Ridge, New York
facility. In connection with this plan, the Company closed its Beaverton, Oregon
facility and recorded lease termination costs of $03 million and a charge for
severance of $06 million $01 million of which was recorded in cost of sales 06 million was recorded in selling, general and administrative expense and
$02 million was recorded in research and development expense. The
implementation of this plan resulted in headcount reductions of 27 employees or
approximately 7% of the workforce as compared to June 30, 2002. Final payments
for severance under this plan occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. As
of June 30, 2004, $08 million of the total $09 million has been paid and $01
million remains in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. Lease termination costs under this plan will be paid by the end
of the third quarter of fiscal 2006.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company adopted a plan to scale
down fixed infrastructure due to the difficult economic environment and to
implement new management operating systems designed to improve processes in
sales, order management, customer relationship management and financial
performance management. In connection with the adoption of this plan, the
Company recorded a charge for severance and other related expenses in the first
quarter of fiscal 2003 of $26 million $21 million of which was recorded in
selling, general and administrative expense and $05 million was recorded in
research and development expense. The plan implemented during fiscal 2003
resulted in improved operating efficiencies and headcount reductions of 38
employees or approximately 9% of the workforce as compared to June 30, 2002. As
of June 30, 2004, $24 million of the total $26 million has been paid and $02
million remains in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. Severance and other related amounts under this plan will be paid
by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2006.
The Company took steps during fiscal 2002 to reduce its expenses in response
to the continued weakness in the technology sector of the economy. As part of
this effort, LeCroy reduced its workforce by 69 employees or approximately 15%
as compared to June 30, 2001. In connection with these workforce reductions, the
Company recorded a $42 million charge $10 million recorded in cost of sales 30 million in selling, general and administrative expense and $02 million in
research and development expense for severance and related expenses, including
costs associated with the succession of the Company Chief Executive Officer
during the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Of the $42 million total charge, $40
million was initially credited to accrued expenses and other liabilities and
$02 million, representing a non-cash expense for the amendment of employee
stock options, was credited to additional paid-in capital. As of December 31,
2003, the 2002 restructuring plan was completed. Cumulative through the
completion of this plan, $39 million of the total $40 million was paid and
$01 million of unused restructuring reserve was credited to selling, general
and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.

3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In August 2000, the Company closed the sale of the assets and business of
its Vigilant Networks, Inc. Vigilant subsidiary and a portion of the assets
and business of its Digitech Industries, Inc. Digitech subsidiary for gross
proceeds of $120 million. The remaining business of Digitech was classified as
discontinued operations. The buyer also assumed certain liabilities of Vigilant.
In connection with the sale, the Company issued warrants to purchase 200,000
shares of LeCroy Common Stock at $1005 per share to the buyer. Using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model, these warrants were valued at approximately
$13 million. After deducting the value of these warrants, along with fees and
certain retained liabilities, the Company recorded a loss of $06 million, net
of a $03 million income tax benefit, on the sale and discontinuance of the
Vigilant Networks business segment. This includes a $14 million adjustment to
the loss recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 due to changes in
estimates.
In fiscal 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded $01 million of gains on sales
of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, net of
income tax provisions, for the reversal of unused accrued discontinued
operations reserves. In addition, the gain on sale of discontinued operations in
fiscal 2003 includes the sale of the residual assets and business of Digitech.
As of June 30, 2004, the Company has accrued discontinued operations reserves of
$02 due to environmental problems on Digitech previously leased facilities
see Note 20.
4. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET
The Company has agreements with two of its customers, who are also vendors,
that provide the Company with the legal right to offset outstanding accounts
receivable balances against outstanding accounts payable balances. At June 30,
2004 and 2003, the Company netted approximately $06 million and $17 million,
respectively, of accounts receivable against accounts payable on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these agreements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company recorded a $21
million charge for the impairment of technology, manufacturing and distribution
rights and a $02 million charge for a related future royalty payment, both of
which are recorded in cost of sales. The impairment resulted from the Company
strategic decision to exit certain older product lines and to make significant
changes to its manufacturing strategy to further improve operating efficiency.
The Company estimated the fair value of the impaired asset based on the present
value of forecasted future cash inflows using a discount rate commensurate with
its weighted average cost of capital.
Amortization expense for those intangible assets with finite lives was $14
million, $20 million and $17 million for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The cost of technology, manufacturing and distribution rights
acquired is amortized primarily on the basis of the higher of units shipped over
the contract periods through June 2008 or on a straight-line basis. Management
estimates intangible assets amortization expense on a straight-line basis in
fiscal 2005 through 2008 will approximate $17 million, $14 million, $14
million, and $13 million, respectively.

In connection with an agreement to license the Company MAUI Instrument
Operating System technology entered into by the Company during the third quarter
of fiscal 2003, the Company agreed to indemnify the licensee against losses
arising from any third party claim against the licensee to the extent such claim
arose directly out of the infringement of a U.S. or Japanese patent by any
LeCroy software components delivered under the license agreement. As of June 30,
2004, there have been no claims under such indemnification provisions.
As is customary in the Test and Measurement industry, and as provided for by
local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, the Company standard terms of
sale provide remedies to customers, such as defense, settlement, or payment of a
judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of the Company
products. Such indemnification provisions are accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. To date, there have been no claims
under such indemnification provisions.                    54

LeCROY CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
At June 30, 2004 and 2003, $74 million and $72 million, respectively, of
the Company net deferred tax assets were included on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets in other current assets, with the remaining $48 million and $79
million, respectively, included in other assets.
The Company is required to recognize all or a portion of its net deferred
tax assets if it believes that it is more likely than not, given the weight of
all available evidence, that all or a portion of its net deferred tax assets
will be realized. Management assesses the realizability of the net deferred tax
assets at each interim and annual balance sheet date based on actual and
forecasted operating results. The Company assessed both its positive and
negative evidence to determine the proper amount of its required valuation
allowance, including the fact that the losses generated from the Company
discontinued operations, as well as certain non-recurring restructuring charges,
principally resulted in the Company cumulative net operating loss for
financial reporting purposes. Management believes that the actions taken to
improve the Company operating performance will result in future projected
operating profits. Moreover, certain tax strategies are available, which include
the ability to capitalize research and development expenditures, that could be
implemented, if necessary, to supplement income from operations to fully realize
the net recorded tax benefits before their expiration. Other factors considered
include the Company current utilization of net operating loss carryforwards as
well as management projection that, as a result of the past cost-cutting
initiatives and new product offerings, the Company fully expects to utilize the
net operating loss carryforwards in the next couple of years, well before the
initial expiration period in fiscal 2019. A valuation allowance has been
established for certain tax credits and foreign net operating loss carryforwards
due to the uncertainty surrounding the utilization of these deferred tax assets.
As such, management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company
will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the valuation
allowance. Management will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred
tax assets at each interim and annual balance sheet date based on actual and
forecasted operating results.
Historically, it has been the practice of the Company to reinvest unremitted
earnings of foreign subsidiaries. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001,
however, the Company determined that it would repatriate approximately $70
million in future periods from one of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company
believes repatriation of these earnings will result in additional taxes in the
amount of $16 million and has provided for that amount in the fiscal 2001 tax
provision. The cumulative amount of all other undistributed earnings of
consolidated foreign subsidiaries, for which U.S. federal income tax has not
been provided, was $256 million and $221 million at June 30, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. These earnings, which reflect full provision for non-U.S. income
taxes, are anticipated to be reinvested permanently outside the United States.
Determining the U.S. income tax liability that might result if these earnings
were remitted is not practicable.
At June 30, 2004, the Company has U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $268 million available to offset future taxable income. The
carryforwards begin to expire at various dates starting in 2019 through 2023.
Foreign tax net operating losses of approximately $10 million at June 30, 2004
are available to offset future taxable income of certain foreign subsidiaries.
Those foreign losses that begin to expire at various dates starting in 2008 are
$05 million and those that do not expire are $05 million. The Company has
approximately $10 million of foreign tax credits, $14 million of state tax
credits and $38 million of federal general business credits available to offset
future payments of income taxes. The foreign, state and federal general tax
credits expire at various dates between 2005 and 2022.
12. DEBT
On November 13, 2003, the Company amended its existing $150 million
revolving credit facility with The Bank of New York. The amended agreement
provides the Company with a $250 million revolving credit facility expiring on
November 30, 2006, which can be used to provide funds for general corporate
purposes and acquisitions. Borrowings under this line bear interest at prime
plus a margin not to exceed 100%, or at the London Interbank Offering Rate
LIBOR plus a margin of between 125% and 225%, depending on the Company
leverage ratio, as such term is defined in the credit agreement. A commitment
fee of 0375% per annum is payable on any unused amount under the facility. This
revolving line of credit is secured by a lien on substantially all of the
domestic assets of the Company. As of June 30, 2004, the Company was in
compliance with its financial covenant requirements and there were no borrowings
outstanding under this line of credit.                    56
LeCROY CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
The Company has a five year $20 million capital lease line of credit
expiring in November 2005, that bears interest at 122%, to fund certain capital
expenditures. As of June 30, 2004 and 2003, the Company had $02 million and
$03 million, respectively, outstanding under this line of credit. The
outstanding borrowings under this line will be repaid by November 2005.
In addition to the above U.S.-based facilities, the Company maintains
certain short-term foreign credit facilities, principally facilities with two
Japanese banks totaling 150 million yen $14 million and $13 million as of
June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. No amounts were outstanding under these
facilities as of June 30, 2004 and 2003.
Interest expense included in other expense income, net in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations was $02 million in fiscal 2004, $01 million in fiscal
2003 and $02 million in fiscal 2002.
13. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS
STOCK OPTION PLANS
The Company maintains three stock option plans, the Amended and Restated
1993 Stock Incentive Plan 1993 Plan, the 1998 Non-Employee Director Stock
Option Plan 1998 Plan and the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan 2003 Plan.
On October 29, 2003, the Company shareholders approved the 2003 Plan. The
2003 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock
options and restricted stock awards to employees including officers and
employee directors and consultants. Unless approved by stockholders owning a
majority of shares present and entitled to vote at a duly convened meeting of
stockholders of the Company, the purchase price of any option granted under the
2003 Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair value on the date of grant. The
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued or transferred
pursuant to options or restricted stock awards under the 2003 Plan shall not
exceed 910,167 shares. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
administers the 2003 Plan and has the authority to determine the terms of such
options or awards including the number of shares, exercise or purchase prices
and times at which the options become and remain exercisable or restricted stock
is no longer restricted. The 2003 Plan expires on October 29, 2013.
The 1993 Plan expired on January 4, 2003. All options outstanding under the
1993 Plan at the time of its expiration will continue in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms. No more than 2,608,696 shares of Common Stock
were allowed to be issued pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock options
granted under the 1993 Plan. This limitation did not apply to non-qualified
stock options or restricted stock awards that were granted under the 1993 Plan.
The vesting period and expiration of each grant was determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. In general, the vesting period
is 25% per annum over a four-year period, or 50% after the second year and 25%
for the third and fourth years. The lives of the options are generally ten years
from the date of grant.
Compensation expense for restricted stock awards is recognized based on the
intrinsic value method defined by APB No. 25. Compensation expense is recognized
ratably over the associated service period, the period in which restrictions are
removed. On June 16, 2004, 365,000 shares of restricted stock were granted under
the 2003 Plan with long-term cliff vesting conditions to certain key employees.
During fiscal 2002, 17,210 shares of restricted stock were granted under the
1993 Plan of which 840 shares are unvested as of June 30, 2004.
In October 1998, the Board of Directors and stockholders terminated the 1995
Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan 1995 Plan and adopted the 1998 Plan.
As of June 30, 2004, stock options to purchase 2,571 shares of Common Stock
issued pursuant to the 1995 Plan are outstanding and fully vested. Pursuant to
the 1998 Plan, each non-employee director receives a stock option grant of
15,000 shares exercisable at the market price on the date the plan was adopted
or upon initial election to the Board of Directors. These options vest ratably
over a 36-month period. Additionally, each non-employee director receives an
annual stock option grant of 7,000 shares 5,000 shares prior to an amendment
dated October 25, 2000 exercisable at the market price on the date of grant.
These options vest immediately. A total of 500,000 shares of Common Stock can be
issued during the term of the 1998 Plan.                    57

266,000 and 955,114 at June 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
In July 1995, the Company adopted the 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the
ESPP and reserved for issuance an aggregate of 434,783 shares of Common
Stock. The purpose of the ESPP is twofold: first, to encourage stock ownership
by employees by establishing a program that permits them to purchase shares of
Common Stock on a regular basis through payroll deductions; and second, to offer
employees an opportunity, without adverse tax consequences, to purchase stock at
a price equal to 85% of the market value on the first or last business day of
the offering period.
On October 29, 2003, the Company shareholders approved the extension of
the expiration of the ESPP from June 7, 2005 to November 30, 2006 and increased
the number of shares available for issuance under the ESPP from 434,783 to
684,783. Through June 30, 2004, 436,299 shares have been issued under the ESPP
and 248,484 shares are available for future issuance.
14. COMMON STOCK
On April 14, 2004, the Company closed an underwritten public follow-on
offering of 500,000 shares of its common stock at $1900 per share less the
underwriting discount raising aggregate net proceeds of approximately $80
million, net of $11 million in offering costs and expenses. The Company granted
the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 225,000 shares of
common stock included in the offering to cover over-allotments, if any, within
30 days of the closing. On April 27, 2004, pursuant to the exercise of this                    58
LeCROY CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
over-allotment option, the Company sold an additional 225,000 shares at $1900
per share less the underwriting discount, raising additional net proceeds of
$41 million, net of expenses. On April 23, 2004, the Company used $40 million
of proceeds from this offering to repay $40 million of indebtedness outstanding
under its revolving credit facility.
15. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE
Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted effect of all common
shares issued and outstanding, and is calculated by dividing net income loss
applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net
income loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number
of common shares used in the basic earnings per share calculation plus the
number of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise or conversion of
all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding. The Company excludes
potential common stock from the calculation of diluted weighted average shares
outstanding if the effect of including such instruments is anti-dilutive to
earnings per share. Accordingly, certain potential common stock have been
excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted average shares totaling 11
million, 36 million, and 35 million shares during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Potential common stock is comprised of restricted shares, employee
and non-employee director stock options and warrants to purchase common stock
and in fiscal 2003 and 2002 convertible redeemable preferred stock. The
following table sets forth the reconciliation of the numerators and the
denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per share computation for each of

16. STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
On November 2, 1998, the Company Board of Directors declared a dividend
distribution of one right in respect to each share of LeCroy Common Stock
outstanding at the record date, November 18, 1998. Initially, the rights will
trade together with the Common Stock and will not be exercisable or separately
tradable. The rights will be exercisable if a person or group acquires, in the
future, 15% or more of the Company stock or announces a tender offer. Right
holders, other than the acquiring person or group, are then entitled to purchase
an amount of the Company stock at a 50% discount to the share price at that
time. The amount of stock that a right holder is entitled to purchase is based
on the exercise price. Under certain circumstances, the right will entitle the
stockholder to buy shares in an acquiring entity at a discount.
The Board of Directors may redeem the rights at a price of $0001 per right
up until 10 days following a public announcement that any person or group has
acquired 15% or more of LeCroy Common Stock. The rights will expire on
November 2, 2008, unless redeemed prior to that date.
17. REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK
On June 30, 1999 the Closing, the Company completed a private placement
of 500,000 shares of its redeemable convertible preferred stock for proceeds of
$100 million. The shares of preferred stock were entitled to a 12% cumulative                    59
LeCROY CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
dividend on the original purchase price of $100 million, with redemption rights
beginning on June 30, 2004 at the sole discretion of the holders of such shares.
In connection with the private placement, the Company issued warrants to
purchase 250,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $20 per share.
On the closing date, the Company used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to
assign an aggregate value of $18 million to the warrants. As such, $18 million
of the $100 million proceeds was allocated to warrants to purchase common stock
and the remaining $82 million was allocated to redeemable convertible preferred
stock. Prior to fiscal 2004, the accretion of the value assigned to the warrants
was recorded as a non-cash charge to net income of approximately $04 million
per year in arriving at net income loss applicable to common stockholders.
On September 27, 2003, the Company repurchased from the holders of its
redeemable convertible preferred stock all 500,000 issued and outstanding shares
for $230 million in cash. In connection with the repurchase of preferred stock,
the Company recorded a charge of approximately $77 million to stockholders'
equity representing the premium paid to the holders of its preferred stock $10
million charged to retained earnings and $67 million charged to additional
paid-in capital and recognized transaction costs of $04 million included in
other income expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In
accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission position published in
an EITF Topic No. D-42 relating to induced conversions of preferred stock, the
Company recorded the $77 million premium paid to purchase the preferred stock
as a charge to arrive at net income applicable to common stockholders in fiscal
2004.
The Company and the holders of its preferred stock agreed that the final
repurchase of preferred stock would be negotiated as though the transaction had
occurred at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2004. As a result, the
Company accounted for the transaction as though no dividends had accrued in
fiscal 2004 and that the charge for the value originally attributed to the
warrants at the point of issue that remained unaccreted at the time of
redemption was accelerated and combined with the redemption premium to reflect
the total charge related to the redemption of convertible preferred stock in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations.
18. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has a trusteed, employee 401k savings plan for eligible U.S.
employees under which it contributes an unconditional match of up to 50% of

Company makes a matching contribution based also upon a percentage of the
employee earnings, as defined, currently ranging from 65% to 140%. For
fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, the Company has expensed $04 million, $03 million

LEASES
Operating leases covering plant, certain office facilities and equipment
expire at various dates through 2010. Future minimum annual lease payments
required during the years ending in fiscal 2005 through 2009 and thereafter,
under noncancelable operating leases having an original term of more than one
year, are $17 million, $12 million, $09 million, $06 million, $01 million
and $02 million, respectively. Aggregate rental expense on noncancelable
operating leases for the years ended June 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 approximated
$21 million, $20 million and $19 million, respectively.
ENVIRONMENTAL
The Company former subsidiary, Digitech Industries, Inc., was notified
prior to 1999 by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection the
DEP that it may be responsible for environmental damage that occurred at its
previously leased facilities in Ridgefield, Connecticut the Ridgefield Site.
Based upon recommendations made by the DEP, Digitech engaged environmental
consultants to assist it in evaluating the costs associated with the DEP
recommendations for monitoring and remediation of the environmental damage.
In May 1999, LeCroy, Digitech Industries, Inc. and the former owners of the
Ridgefield Site entered into an agreement with the current owners of the
Ridgefield Site. The current owners have purchased an insurance policy providing
for $20 million of coverage against certain environmental liabilities related
to the Ridgefield Site. This insurance policy names both LeCroy and Digitech as
insured parties. The current owners of the Ridgefield Site have also agreed to
remediate all environmental problems associated with the property and to obtain
all applicable approvals and certifications from the DEP. The current owners of
the Ridgefield Site have also agreed to hold both LeCroy and Digitech Industries
harmless in the event of a claim made against them relating to these
environmental matters. In return for the above, forty-five days after the DEP
has provided written notification to the Company that the site remediation has
been accomplished to its satisfaction, the Company agreed to pay the former
owners of the Ridgefield Site $02 million as compensation for the reduced sale
value of the property due to the environmental problems existing on the site.
The Company has retained this liability after the sale of the Vigilant segment
and the residual assets of Digitech.                    61                LeCROY CORPORATION

TECHNOLOGY
As of June 30, 2004, the Company has one technology license agreement under
which it is unconditionally committed to pay $03 million in fiscal 2005.
LEGAL
On April 28, 2003, Tektronix, Inc. Tektronix filed a complaint against
the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon
claiming that the Company infringed on eight of Tektronix' U.S. patents. In the
Company responsive pleading, the Company denied that it has infringed, or is
infringing, any of these patents, and contends that the patents are invalid.
Four of these patents concern software user interface features for
oscilloscopes, two concern circuitry and two concern probes. On August 5, 2003,
the Company filed a counterclaim in the United States District Court for the
District of Oregon claiming that Tektronix is infringing three of the Company
patents. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend
this action vigorously. Discovery in this case is ongoing and the outcome cannot
be predicted.
On January 15, 2003, LeCroy was sued by Sicom Systems Sicom in the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware for patent
infringement of a U.S. patent relating to the graphical display of test limits.
LeCroy answered the complaint denying infringement and asserted a counterclaim
alleging the invalidity of the patent and that Sicom had abused the judicial
process by bringing a baseless patent infringement claim. On July 16, 2003,
LeCroy filed a Motion to Dismiss Sicom case, contending that Sicom did not
have standing to bring the litigation. On November 20, 2003, the Court granted
LeCroy Motion to Dismiss. On December 18, 2003, Sicom filed a Notice of Appeal
to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On December 30,
2003, Sicom filed a new patent infringement lawsuit against LeCroy in the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware. Tektronix and Agilent
Technologies are also co-defendants in this new litigation. The complaint in
this new case is essentially the same as the complaint filed by Sicom on January
15, 2003, except that Sicom now states that it entered into an amendment to its
license agreement with the Canadian government on December 19, 2003, and that
Sicom now has the exclusive right to bring suit for infringement of the patent
in the United States. On January 5, 2004, Sicom filed a Notice and Order of
Dismissal of Appeal of its appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit and the Order was entered on the following day. In LeCroy responsive
pleading, LeCroy has denied that it has infringed, or is infringing, the patent,
and contends that the patent is invalid. LeCroy intends to defend itself
vigorously in this litigation. The defendants in this case, including us, have
filed a Motion to Dismiss for lack of standing. The Motion contends that Sicom
amended license agreement with Canada does not cure the standing defects that
caused the Court to dismiss the original lawsuit. The Court has stayed the case
pending resolution of the new Motion to Dismiss and the outcome cannot be
predicted.
From time to time, the Company is involved in other lawsuits, claims,
investigations and proceedings, including patent and environmental matters,
which arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending
that the Company expects to have a material adverse impact on its business,
results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
21. RELATED PARTY
On October 20, 2000, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
approved a $03 million five-year loan to Thomas H. Reslewic, LeCroy Chief
Executive Officer and President, secured by Mr. Reslewic non-qualified stock
options. The loan accrues interest at 95% compounded annually with interest
payable at the maturity of the loan. If Mr. Reslewic remains an employee of
LeCroy for the entire five-year term of the loan or is terminated without cause
prior to the maturity date of the loan, the Company will forgive the loan
principal and all accrued interest. The outstanding balance under this loan at
June 30, 2004 and 2003 was $01 million.                    62

2003 and September 30, 2002, respectively. Severance charges during the
quarters ended December 31, 2003 and June 30, 2003 were partially offset by
the reversal of an unused 2002 restructuring reserve of $01 million. During
the quarter ended June 30, 2003, the Company adopted a plan to consolidate
its probe development activities into its Chestnut Ridge, New York facility.
In connection with this plan, the Company closed its Beaverton, Oregon
facility and recorded lease termination costs of $03 million

23. SUBSEQUENT EVENT
On September 1, 2004, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire 100%
of the outstanding common stock of Computer Access Technology Corporation
CATC for $600 per share in a purchase business combination. Under the terms
of the agreement, the Company also will pay additional cash to the holders of
CATC outstanding, vested in-the-money stock options. In addition, the Company
will issue stock options to assume CATC outstanding unvested stock options. As
a result, the Company expects the total purchase price of the transaction to be
approximately $85 million, excluding CATC $45 million of cash and investments.
The Company intends to fund the cash requirement of approximately $81
million, through a combination of its existing cash and $50 million of term
debt, which is part of a $75 million credit facility to be underwritten by the
Bank of New York. The transaction is subject to approval by the stockholders of
CATC and the closing of a new credit facility to finance the acquisition, as
well as regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing
conditions.                    64                                   SCHEDULE II
