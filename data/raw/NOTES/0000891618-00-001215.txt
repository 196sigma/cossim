ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Aradigm Corporation
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Aradigm Corporation as
of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related statements of operations,
shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1999. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Aradigm Corporation at
December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

ARADIGM CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization and Basis of Presentation
Aradigm Corporation the Company is a California corporation. Through
June 1997, prior to the signing of the Company collaborative agreement with
SmithKline Beecham see Note 7, the Company was in the development stage. Since
inception, Aradigm has been engaged in the development and commercialization of
non-invasive pulmonary drug delivery systems. The Company does not anticipate
receiving significant revenue from the sale of products in the upcoming year.
Principal activities to date have included obtaining financing, recruiting
management and technical personnel, securing operating facilities, conducting
research and development, and expanding commercial production capabilities.
These factors indicate that the Company ability to continue its research,
development and commercialization activities is dependent upon the ability of
management to obtain additional financing as required.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Depreciation and Amortization
The Company records property and equipment at cost and calculates
depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the respective assets, generally three to seven years. Machinery and equipment
acquired under capital leases is amortized over the useful lives of the assets.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease
or useful life of the improvement.
Revenue Recognition
Contract revenues consist of revenue from collaboration agreements and
feasibility studies. The Company recognizes revenue under the agreements as
costs are incurred. Deferred revenue represents the portion of research payments
received that has not been earned. In accordance with contract terms, milestone
payments from collaborative research agreements are considered reimbursements
for costs incurred under the agreements and, accordingly, are generally deferred
when received and recognized as revenue based on actual efforts expended over
the remaining terms of the agreements. Costs of contract revenue approximate
such revenue and are included in research and development expenses. Refundable
development and license fee payments are deferred until the specified
performance criteria are achieved.
Net Loss Per Share
Historical net loss per share has been calculated under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share. Basic net loss per
share on a historical basis is computed using the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding less the weighted average number of shares
subject to repurchase. In the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, the
weighted average number of shares subject to repurchase were 48,000, 158,000 and
315,000, respectively. No diluted loss per share information has been presented
in the accompanying statements of operations since potential common shares from
stock options and warrants are antidilutive. The total number of shares excluded
from diluted loss per share relating to these securities was 899,319, 1,234,298
and 695,799 shares for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.

Employee Benefit Plans
The Company has a 401k Plan which stipulates that all full-time employees
with at least three months of employment can elect to contribute to the 401k
Plan, subject to certain limitations, up to 20% of salary on a pretax basis. The
Company has the option to provide matching contributions but has not done so to
date.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Financial
Instruments and for Hedging Activities SFAS 133 which provides a
comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of
derivatives and hedging activities. SFAS 133 is effective for years beginning
after June 15, 2000 and is not anticipated to have an impact on the Company
results of operations or financial condition when adopted.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform
with current year presentation.
2. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Cash Equivalents and Investments
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company
places its cash and cash equivalents in money market funds, commercial paper and
corporate notes. The Company short-term investments consist of commercial
paper and corporate notes with maturities ranging from three to twelve months.
The Company classifies its investments as available-for-sale.
Available-for-sale investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains
and losses reported in the statement of shareholders' equity. Fair values of
investments are based on quoted market prices, where available. Realized gains
and losses, which have been immaterial to date, are included in interest and
other income and are derived using the specific identification method for
determining the cost of investments sold. Dividend and interest income is
recognized when earned.
The following summarizes the Company fair value of cash equivalents and
investments amounts in thousands                                DECEMBER 31,

As of December 31, 1999 and 1998, the difference between the fair value and
the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities was immaterial. As of
December 31, 1999, the average portfolio duration was approximately three
months, and the contractual maturity of any single investment did not exceed six
months from the balance sheet date.

term. In July 1999, the Company leased a new facility for clinical manufacturing
and moved into a new leased administrative and laboratory facility. The Company
leases its office, laboratory and manufacturing facilities under several
operating leases expiring through the year 2016.

5. CONTINGENCIES
In June 1998, Eli Lilly and Company Lilly filed a complaint against the
Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Indiana. The complaint made various allegations against the Company, arising
from the Company decision to enter into an exclusive collaboration with Novo
Nordisk A/S with respect to the development and commercialization of a pulmonary
delivery system for insulin and insulin analogs. The Company has sponsored
various studies of the pulmonary delivery of insulin and insulin analogs using
materials supplied by Lilly under a series of agreements dating from January
1996. The Company and Lilly had also conducted negotiations concerning a
long-term supply agreement under which Lilly would supply bulk insulin to the
Company for commercialization in the Company AERx Diabetes Management System,
and a separate agreement under which the Company would license certain
intellectual property to Lilly. These negotiations were terminated after the
Company proceeded with its agreement with Novo Nordisk A/S. The complaint seeks
a declaration that Lilly scientists are co-inventors of a patent application
filed by the Company relating to pulmonary delivery of an insulin analog or, in
the alternative, enforcement of an alleged agreement to grant Lilly an
nonexclusive license under such patent application. The complaint also contains
allegations of misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of fiduciary duty,
conversion and unjust enrichment and seeks unspecified damages and injunctive
relief. Management believes that it has meritorious defenses against each of Eli
Lilly claims and that this litigation will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
However, there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in this case.
The Company recently filed an answer denying all material allegations of the
complaint and a motion for summary judgment directed against all claims in Eli
Lilly complaint.
6. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
Capital Stock
In March 1999, the Company completed a private placement of 2,428,338
shares of its common stock, raising approximately $248 million in net proceeds.
In June 1998, the company raised approximately $50 million through a private
sale of 312,396 shares of its common stock to a development partner at a 25%
premium to the market price. In April 1998, the Company raised approximately
$120 million through a private sale of 1,111,100 shares of its common stock to
a group of institutional investors.
At December 31, 1999, the Company has reserved 326,665 shares of its common
stock for issuance upon exercise of common stock warrants and 3,753,947 shares

Stock Warrants
In December 1998, the Company issued a warrant in connection with an
operating lease agreement that entitles the holder to purchase 50,000 shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $1094 per share. This warrant is
exercisable through December 2005. Management valued the warrant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model and is amortizing the warrant over the term
of the operating lease agreement, which is 17 years.
In April 1998, the Company issued warrants to the placement agents of the
private placement of common stock that entitles the holders to purchase 166,665

issued a warrant that entitled the holder to purchase 170,000 shares of common
stock at an exercise price of $896 per share. In June 1998, the Company and the
holder mutually agreed to cancel 60,000 unvested shares of the original 170,000
shares, leaving an outstanding balance of 110,000 shares. This warrant is
exercisable through August 2003. 26,000 shares vested immediately upon issuance
of the warrant. Another 24,000 shares vested ratably over the first twelve

shareholders approved the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan the Plan, which amended
and restated the 1992 Stock Option Plan. Options granted under the Plan may be
either incentive or non-statutory stock options. At December 31, 1999, the
Company had authorized 4,800,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the
Plan. Options granted under the Plan expire no later than ten years from the
date of grant. For incentive and non-statutory stock option grants, the option
price shall be at least 100% and 85%, respectively, of the fair value on the
date of grant, as determined by the Board of Directors. If at any time the
Company grants an option, and the optionee directly or by attribution owns stock
possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of
stock of the Company, the option price shall be at least 110% of the fair value
and shall not be exercisable more than five years after the date of grant.
Options granted under the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan are immediately
exercisable subject to repurchase provisions, and the shares acquired generally
vest over a period of four years from the date of grant. The Plan also provides
for a transition from employee to consultant status without termination of the
vesting period as a result of such transition. Under the Plan, employees may
exercise options in exchange for a note payable to the Company. As of December
31, 1999 and 1998, full recourse notes receivable from shareholders of $163,000
and $288,000, respectively, were outstanding. These notes generally bear
interest at 6% and are due and payable in regular installments over a five-year
period. Any unvested stock issued is subject to repurchase agreements whereby
the Company has the option to repurchase unvested shares upon termination of
employment at the original issue price. The common stock has voting rights but
does not have resale rights prior to vesting. The Company has repurchased a
total of 38,294 shares in accordance with these agreements. During 1999, the
Company granted options to purchase 475,347 shares of common stock, none of
which were exercised subject to repurchase agreements.

The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, and the related
Interpretations in accounting for its employee and non-employee director stock
options because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting
provided for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123, requires use of option
pricing valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee
stock options. Under APB 25, the Company has generally recognized no
compensation expense with respect to such awards.

6. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY CONTINUED
1996 Equity Incentive Plan continued
The Company recorded deferred compensation of approximately $704,000 for
the difference between the grant price and the fair value of certain of the
Company common stock options granted in 1998. This amount is being amortized
over the vesting period of the individual options. There were no such grants in
1999 or in 1997. Amortization of deferred compensation recognized in the years
ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 was approximately $162,000, $267,000 and
$204,000, respectively. The weighted average fair value of options granted in
1998 with an exercise price below the deemed fair value of the Company common
stock on the date of grant was $1213. The weighted average fair value of
options granted during 1999, 1998 and 1997 with an exercise price equal to the
fair value of the Company common stock on the date of grant was $498, $609
and $335, respectively.
Pro forma information regarding net loss and basic and diluted net loss per
share is required by SFAS 123, which also requires that the information be
determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee and non-employee
director stock options granted subsequent to December 31, 1994 under the fair
value method prescribed by this statement. The fair value of options was
estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following assumptions: a risk-free interest rate of 52%, 52% and
57% - 64% for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively;
a dividend yield of 00%; the annual volatility factor of the expected market
price of the Company common stock for 1999, 1998 and 1997 are 064, 063 and
070, respectively; and a weighted average expected option life of four years.
Options granted prior to the Company initial public offering in June 1996 have
a volatility factor of 00.
For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the vesting period of the options using the
straight-line method. Pro forma information on the above basis is as follows
amounts in thousands, except per share amounts                                 YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

Pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share. $ 185  $ 141  $ 146   The effects of applying SFAS 123 for pro forma disclosures are not likely
to be representative of the effects on reported net loss for future years. Pro
forma net loss for the year ended December 31, 1998 reflects compensation
expense for four years' vesting, while the year ending December 31, 1999
reflects compensation expense for five years' vesting of outstanding stock
options.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan, 380,000
shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance. Shares may be
purchased under the Purchase Plan at 85% of the lesser of the fair market value
of the common stock on the grant date or purchase date. As of December 31, 1999,
209,059 shares have been issued under the Purchase Plan.
1996 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan
The 1996 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan the Directors' Plan
authorizes the grant of 225,000 options for the Company common stock. As of
December 31, 1999, 104,068 options have been granted under the Directors' Plan.
During the year ended December 31, 1999, 21,568 shares were granted

7. COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS
In May 1999, Aradigm signed an agreement with Genentech to develop the drug
dornase alfa in the AERx system. Dornase alfa is the active ingredient in the
currently marketed Genentech product, Pulmozyme. The agreement provides that
development expenses incurred by Aradigm will be reimbursed by Genentech in the
form of loans supported by promissory notes bearing interest at two percent over
the prime rate which was 105% at December 31, 1999. Principal and unpaid
accrued interest is due at the earlier of 15 days after FDA approval or seven
years after the effective date of the collaborative agreement or May 21, 2006.
Upon receipt of FDA approval, Aradigm will receive a milestone payment that is
larger than the loan principal and accrued interest, allowing the loan to be
repaid in full. The Company will also receive certain milestone payments at
various points of product development.
In June 1998, the Company executed a development and commercialization
agreement with Novo Nordisk to jointly develop a pulmonary delivery system for
administering insulin by inhalation. In addition, the agreement provides Novo
Nordisk with an option to develop the technology for delivery of other
compounds. Under the terms of the agreement, Novo Nordisk has been granted
exclusive rights to worldwide sales and marketing rights to any products
developed under the terms of the agreement.
In 1999, pursuant to the Novo Nordisk agreement, Aradigm had received
approximately $139 million milestone and product development payments and could
receive up to $34 million in additional milestone payments and a $50 million
equity investment. In 1998, Aradigm received approximately $135 million,
including the purchase of $50 million of newly issued Aradigm common stock at a
25% premium to the market price. In addition, Novo Nordisk will fund all product
development costs incurred by Aradigm, while the development partners will
co-fund final development of the AERx device. Aradigm will be the initial
manufacturer of all the products covered by the agreement and will receive a
share of the overall gross profits resulting from Novo Nordisk sales of the
products. Through December 31, 1999, the Company has recognized total contract
revenue of $140 million $87 million and $53 million in 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
In September 1997, the Company executed a development and commercialization
agreement with SmithKline Beecham covering use of the AERx Pain Management
System for the delivery of narcotic analgesics. The Company and SmithKline
Beecham will collaborate on the development of the products within this field.
Under the terms of the agreement, SmithKline Beecham has been granted exclusive
worldwide sales and marketing rights to the AERx Pain Management System for use
with such analgesics, and Aradigm retains all manufacturing rights. If this
system receives regulatory approval, Aradigm intends to sell devices and drug
packets to SmithKline Beecham and will receive royalties on developed product
sold by SmithKline Beecham.
At December 31, 1999, the Company had received from SmithKline Beecham
approximately $19 million in milestone and product development payments and $5
million from the purchase of shares of Aradigm common stock at a 25% premium to
the market price. As of December 31, 1999, pursuant to the agreement, Aradigm is
entitled to approximately $44 million in additional product development
payments, and could receive $14 million in additional milestone payments and
additional future product development payments, if and when the first product
from the collaboration is commercialized. The Company also has the rights to
receive an additional $5 million equity investment from SmithKline Beecham.
Additional milestone and product development payments will be paid if Aradigm
and SmithKline Beecham decide to jointly develop

additional AERx systems which incorporate other opiates or opioids. Through
December 31, 1999, the Company has recognized total contract revenue of $188
million $52 million, $110 million and $26 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.
8. INCOME TAXES
The Company uses the liability method to account for income taxes as
required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rules and laws that
are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
Significant components of the Company deferred tax assets are as follows

1998, respectively.
As of December 31, 1999, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards
of approximately $57,000,000 which expire in the tax years 2006 through 2019 and
net operating losses for state income tax purposes of $32,500,000 expiring in
the years 2000 through 2004. At December 31, 1999, the Company had research and
development credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of
approximately $1,909,000, which expire in the years 2006 through 2013.
Because of the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of
1986, utilization of the Company tax net operating loss carryforwards and tax
credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation in future periods.
As a result of the annual limitation, a portion of these carryforwards may
expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce future income tax
liabilities.
9. SUBSEQUENT EVENT
PROPOSED PUBLIC OFFERING OF COMMON STOCK
In February 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to proceed
