Item 8.
In May 1999, we, along with our former wholly-owned subsidiary, Tenneco
Packaging Inc. now known as Pactiv, and a number of containerboard
manufacturers were named as defendants in a civil class action antitrust lawsuit
pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania. The lawsuit alleges that the defendants conspired to raise
linerboard prices for corrugated containers and corrugated sheets, respectively,
from October 1, 1993 through November 30, 1995, in violation of Section 1 of the
Sherman Act. The lawsuit seeks treble damages in an unspecified amount, plus
attorney fees. Under and in accordance with the distribution agreement we
entered into with Pactiv before the 1999 Spin-off, as between us and Pactiv,
Pactiv will be responsible for defending the claims and for any liability
resulting from the action. Accordingly, we believe the outcome of this
litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or
results of operations.
We are also party to various other legal proceedings arising from our
operations. We believe that the outcome of these other proceedings, individually
and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
position or results of operations.

The declaration of dividends on our capital stock is at the discretion of
our Board of Directors. The board has not adopted a dividend policy as such;
subject to legal and contractual restrictions, its decisions regarding dividends
are based on all considerations that in its business judgment are relevant at
the time. These considerations may include past and projected earnings, cash
flows, economic, business and securities market conditions and anticipated
developments concerning our business and operations.
We are highly leveraged and restricted with respect to the payment of
dividends under the terms of our financing arrangements. On January 10, 2001, we
announced that our board of directors eliminated the regular quarterly dividend
on the company common stock. The board took this action in response to
then-current industry conditions, primarily greater than anticipated production
volume reductions by original equipment manufacturers in North America and
continued softness in the global aftermarket. For additional information
concerning our payment of dividends, see Item 7, Management Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

a For a discussion of the significant items affecting comparability of the
financial information for the years ended 2001, 2000, and, 1999, see
Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations. We have reduced revenues for 2000, 1999, 1998, and 1997 by $21
million, $19 million, $18 million, and $22 million, respectively, to reflect
the reclassification of certain sales incentives that were previously shown
in selling, general, and administrative expense. You should read Note 1 to
the financial statements for further information about this required
accounting change.
b Debt amounts for 1998 and 1997, and for 1999 through November 4, 1999, are
net of allocations of corporate debt to the net assets of our discontinued
specialty packaging and paperboard packaging segments. Interest expense for
periods presented is net of interest expense allocated to income from
discontinued operations. These allocations of debt and related interest
expense are based on the ratio of our investment in the specialty packaging
and paperboard packaging segments' respective net assets to our consolidated
net assets plus debt. You should also read Notes to the Financial Statements
of Tenneco Automotive Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries for more
information.
c Discontinued operations reflected in the above periods consist of our 1
specialty packaging segment, which was discontinued in August 1999 and 2
paperboard packaging segment, which was discontinued in June 1999. You
should also read Notes to the Financial Statements of Tenneco Automotive
Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries for more information.
d Represents our costs related to prepayment of debt, the 1999 loss recognized
in connection with the contribution of the containerboard assets to a new
joint venture, and the 1999 loss recognized in the spin-off of Tenneco
Packaging Inc. You should also read Notes to the Financial Statements of
Tenneco Automotive Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries for more information.
e In 1999, we implemented the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants Statement of Position 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-up
Activities. In addition, effective January 1, 1999, we changed our method
of accounting for customer acquisition costs from a deferred method to an
expense-as-incurred method. In 1997, we implemented the Financial Accounting
Standards Board Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 97-13, Accounting for
Costs Incurred in Connection with a Consulting Contract that Combines
Business Process Reengineering and Information Technology Transformation.
You should also read Notes to the Financial Statements of Tenneco Automotive
Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries for additional information.
f EBITDA represents income from continuing operations before interest expense,
income taxes, minority interest and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is
not a calculation based upon generally accepted accounting principles. The
amounts included in the EBITDA calculation, however, are derived from
amounts included in the historical statements of income data. In addition,
EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating
income as an indicator of our operating performance, or as an alternative to
operating cash flows as a measure of liquidity. We have reported EBITDA
because we believe EBITDA is a measure commonly reported and widely used by
investors and other interested parties as an indicator of a company
ability to incur and service debt. We believe EBITDA assists investors in
comparing a company performance on a consistent basis without regard to
depreciation and amortization, which can vary significantly depending upon
accounting
26 methods, particularly when acquisitions are involved, or nonoperating factors.
However, the EBITDA measure presented in this document may not always be
comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to
differences in the components of the calculation.
g For purposes of computing this ratio, earnings generally consist of income
from continuing operations before income taxes and fixed charges excluding
capitalized interest. Fixed charges consist of interest expense, the portion
of rental expense considered representative of the interest factor and
capitalized interest. For purposes of computing these ratios, preferred
stock dividends have been included in the calculations on a pre-tax basis.
For 2001 and 2000, earnings were insufficient by $81 million and $74
million, respectively, to cover fixed charges.
27 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
As you read the following review of our financial condition and results of
operations, you should also read our financial statements and related notes
beginning on page 53.
BACKGROUND
Tenneco Automotive Inc., is one of the world leading manufacturers of
automotive emissions control and ride control products for both the original
equipment and aftermarket. We completed the separation of our packaging business
in a series of transactions during 1999, culminating in the spin-off to our
shareholders of the common stock of Pactiv Corporation formerly known as
Tenneco Packaging, Inc., on November 4, 1999. As a result, our former specialty
and paperboard packaging operations are presented as discontinued operations in
the accompanying financial statements. You should read Note 3 to the financial
statements for more information about our discontinued operations.

Rest of    308   335   8
$3,364  $3,528   5
Results for 2000 have been reclassified for comparability to reflect a
change in how we record certain sales incentives. Effective January 1, 2001, we
changed the way we classify some sales incentives in accordance with the May
2000 consensus reached by the Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging
Issues Task Force on Issue No. 00-14, Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives.
The impact of this reclassification on 2000 results was a reduction in net sales
of $21 million with an offsetting reduction in selling, general and
administrative expense.
Our North American revenues decreased $156 million in 2001 compared to 2000
reflecting lower sales generated from both our original equipment and
aftermarket businesses. OE revenues declined 8 percent to $1,275 million in the
current year due mostly to significant OE production cutbacks in both the light
and heavy-duty vehicle segments as vehicle manufacturers adjusted production
levels in the face of a slowing economy. OE emissions control revenues declined
5 percent; however, excluding a $68 million increase in catalytic converter
revenues due to increased cost of precious metals that are passed through to our
customers, OE emissions control revenues declined 16 percent. These
pass-through catalytic converter sales occur when, at the direction of our OE
customer, we purchase catalytic converters or components from suppliers, use
them in our manufacturing process, and sell them as part of the completed
system. OE ride control revenues were down 15 percent for the year. Lower ride
control volumes, especially in our heavy-duty elastomer business, contributed to
the decline in OE ride control revenues. Contributing to the volume reduction
was a decrease in the North American light vehicle build rate from 173 million
units in 2000 to 155 million units in 2001, and a decline in the heavy duty
vehicle build rate from 358 thousand units in 2000 to 233 thousand units in
2001. OE price reductions in both ride control and emissions control also
contributed $11 million to the North America revenue decrease. Aftermarket
revenues were $515 million in 2001, representing a decline of 7 percent from the
previous year. Lower industry volumes continue to impact our North American
aftermarket business. Aftermarket emissions control revenues decreased 10
percent in 2001, while our aftermarket ride control revenues declined 4 percent
compared to a year ago. Lower volumes accounted for $57 million of the reduction
in aftermarket revenues. This was partially offset by revenues from a new large
ride control customer beginning in the third quarter of 2001.
28 Price increases implemented on some products in North America in the first and
second quarters of 2001 have taken hold and have more than offset negative price
adjustments that were initiated during 2000. Overall, we believe our share of
the North American ride control aftermarket increased 3 percentage points to 52
percent at the end of 2001, reflecting the addition of new customers. However,
our share of the North American emissions control aftermarket decreased 3
percentage points to 35 percent at the end of 2001 due to sales to our existing
customers. There were no significant changes in our North American emissions
control aftermarket customer base in 2001.
Our European segment revenues increased $19 million in 2001 compared to
last year. OE revenues increased 9 percent to $962 million in the year.
Contributing to the OE revenue increase were stronger exhaust volumes, which
added $144 million of additional revenue, in both our new and existing programs.
Rising precious metal prices that we have passed through to our OE exhaust
customers are $82 million of the increase. Excluding the impact of these
pass-through sales, OE exhaust revenues would have increased 3 percent.
Offsetting the volume increase was the devaluation of currency which reduced
exhaust revenues by $32 million. Ride control revenues were down 8 percent year
over year. Lower volumes reduced revenues by $14 million. Also the devaluation
of European currencies resulted in a reduction in OE ride control revenues of $9
million in 2001. Excluding these currency impacts, overall European OE revenues
would have increased 14 percent in 2001 compared to the prior year. The overall
European build rate was 195 million units compared to 199 million units in
2000. The primary reason that our European OE revenues exceeded the build rate
decrease was a higher level of pass-through sales in our exhaust business.
European aftermarket revenues were $304 million in 2001 compared to $367 million
in the prior year. This 17 percent decline resulted from the continued softness
of the aftermarket industry combined with declining exhaust replacement rates
due primarily to the increasing original equipment use of longer lasting
stainless steel. Price increases that relate to our global aftermarket pricing
strategy provided favorable results in 2001, contributing some positive revenue
growth and helping to partially offset the impact from lower volumes. Negatively
impacting European aftermarket revenue was the devaluation of European
currencies, which reduced revenues by $10 million.
Revenues from our operations in the rest of the world, specifically South
America, Australia and Asia, decreased $27 million in 2001 primarily due to the
$38 million impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding these currency
impacts, total revenues for the rest of the world would have increased 3 percent
compared to the same period last year. The impact of foreign currency was $24
million in South America and $14 million in Australia. This was partially offset
by strong volume growth in South America and Asia. The South America volume
growth is attributable to several new OE programs. In Asia, OE volumes increased
due to new platforms in production at our exhaust manufacturing facility in
Shanghai.
Income Before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, and Minority Interest
EBIT
We reported EBIT of $92 million in 2001 compared to $120 million in 2000.
Reported results for both years include restructuring and other charges that
have an effect on comparability of EBIT results between the years. As a result
of the 1999 spin-off, we provided an analysis of stand alone costs for
comparability of 1999 to 2000. These are not necessary for the 2001 to 2000
comparisons as they each reflect a full year of stand alone costs. For further
discussion on prior year stand alone costs, see Years
29 2000 and 1999 - Operating Results - EBIT. The following tables reflect the
impact on each segment of the restructuring and other charges.                                  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001

In the preceding table, amounts reported as restructuring and other charges
for 2001 include: $42 million related to the 2001 restructuring plans; $9
million for other restructuring related costs and expenses such as relocation
and moving costs that could not be accrued as part of the restructuring reserve 2 million for environmental remediation activity, principally in Europe; and $2
million related to costs associated with the amendment of certain terms of our
senior credit facility in early 2001. Amounts reported as restructuring and
other charges for 2000 include: $46 million related to the 2000 restructuring
plans; $15 million for other related costs and expenses that could not be
accrued as part of the restructuring reserve; $13 million related to a stock
option buyback and a $9 million reversal of a reserve for the transaction costs
related to the November 1999 spin-off of Pactiv. For further details of these
costs see the sections entitled Restructuring Charges and Liquidity and
Capital Resources - Capitalization elsewhere in this Management Discussion
and Analysis. The following discussion of our EBIT results for 2001 and 2000
compares the columns in the tables above titled Operating Unit Results.
EBIT for North American operations decreased to $79 million in 2001 from
$112 million a year ago. North American OE EBIT decreased $59 million from the
prior year. A drop in both light and heavy-duty vehicle production volumes and a
decline in the higher margin elastomer business combined to reduce EBIT for the
North American OE business by $24 million. Also, unfavorable pricing impacts
were $13 million and we incurred $7 million in higher costs primarily related to
engineering for new vehicle launches. Foreign currency losses, mostly
attributable to declines in the Canadian dollar, were $5 million. Our
restructuring actions saved $7 million. This was, however, more than offset by
higher overhead costs. North American aftermarket EBIT increased $26 million
over the prior year. Lower selling, general and administrative overhead expenses
and cost savings generated from our restructuring efforts improved EBIT by $42
million. Also contributing $6 million to the aftermarket EBIT increase were
price increases implemented in the first and second quarters of 2001, which have
more than offset negative price adjustments implemented during 2000. Lower
volumes resulted in a $17 million decrease in EBIT. Additionally, we incurred
increased customer changeover costs of $7 million compared to last year,
primarily associated with a new ride control customer.
Our European segment EBIT decreased $6 million to $47 million in 2001
versus the prior year. European OE EBIT decreased by $8 million from the prior
year. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted OE EBIT by $4 million in
the period. Lower volumes and negative pricing also contributed to
30 the reduction. Our European aftermarket EBIT increased by $2 million from the
prior year. Improved pricing contributed $13 million to EBIT in the year. Lower
selling, general and administrative expenses also generated $18 million.
Offsetting these increases were lower volumes which decreased EBIT by $27
million.
EBIT for our operations in the rest of the world increased by $1 million in
2001 compared with the prior year. EBIT for our Asia operations improved due to
stronger volumes in our OE exhaust operations in Shanghai. This increase was
partially offset by the impact of foreign currency devaluation of $2 million.
EBIT as a Percentage of Revenue
The following table shows EBIT as a percentage of revenue by segment. The
EBIT percentage is calculated after excluding the Restructuring and Other
Charges described previously.                                   YEAR ENDED

Total Tenneco      4%     5   In North America, EBIT as a percentage of revenue decreased by 2 percent.
Production cuts by vehicle manufacturers, declines in higher-margin elastomer
sales, pricing pressure from vehicle manufacturers and the increase in
pass-through converter sales contributed to the lower margins in our OE
business. In the North America aftermarket, EBIT as a percentage of revenue
improved due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses and increased
prices. In Europe, EBIT margins remained flat despite a 2 percent increase in
revenues. This is due to the pass-through sales, which generally have a very low
margin, becoming a greater percentage of total revenues. Significant
improvements in OE exhaust operations were offset by costs associated with the
Polish ride control plant start-up, reserves for bad debt, currency impacts and
lower aftermarket volumes. EBIT as a percentage of revenue for the rest of the
world increased one percent year over year despite the impact of foreign
currency devaluation. Stronger volumes and improved mix offset the foreign
currency devaluation.
Restructuring and Other Charges
Over the past several years we have adopted plans to restructure portions
of our operations. These plans were approved by the Board of Directors and were
designed to reduce operational and administrative overhead costs throughout the
business. Charges to income related to these plans are recorded in the period in
which the plans are finalized and approved, while actions necessary to affect
these restructuring plans occur over future periods in accordance with
established plans.
The 1999 plan involved closing a ride control manufacturing facility and an
exhaust plant in Europe, closing or downsizing four European aftermarket
distribution centers, closing a North American exhaust manufacturing facility
plus employee reductions of approximately 780. Over 750 employees have been
terminated under the 1999 plan as of December 31, 2001. We have delayed closing
one European aftermarket distribution location as a result of customer
requirements. Actions necessary to complete closing the operation of this
location as an aftermarket distribution center are in process, and we expect to
complete those actions in 2002. However, we have now determined that we will
continue to use the facility in our manufacturing operations. The fourth quarter
2001 restructuring plan described below includes the cost to close a nearby
manufacturing facility. Those operations will be moved to the former
distribution facility and some of the existing workforce will remain. Therefore,
we adjusted the cost to complete the 1999 plan downward by $3 million during the
fourth quarter of 2001, representing primarily severance and other related costs
that will no longer be incurred. The reversal is reflected in cost of sales in
the 2001 income statement. This completes all our restructuring actions related
to the 1999 plan.
31   In the fourth quarter of 2000, our Board of Directors approved a
restructuring plan to further reduce administrative and operational overhead
costs. We recorded, in the fourth quarter of 2000, a pre-tax charge related to
the plan of $46 million, $32 million after tax, or $92 per diluted common
share. Within the statement of income, $13 million of the pre-tax charge is
reflected in cost of sales, while $33 million is included in selling, general,
and administrative expenses. The charge is comprised of $24 million of severance
and related costs for salaried employment reductions worldwide and $22 million
for the reduction of manufacturing and distribution capacity in response to
long-term market trends. The 2000 plan involved closing a North American
aftermarket exhaust distribution facility and a ride control manufacturing plant
in our Asian market, as well as the consolidation of some exhaust manufacturing
facilities in Europe. In addition, the plan involves the elimination of 700
positions, including temporary employees. We wrote down the assets at the
locations to be closed to their estimated fair value, less costs to sell. We
estimated the market value of buildings using external real estate appraisals.
As a result of the single purpose nature of the machinery and equipment to be
disposed of, fair value was estimated to be scrap value less costs to dispose in
most cases. We do not expect that cash proceeds on the sale of these assets will
be significant. As of December 31, 2001, 600 employees have been terminated
under the 2000 plan primarily in North America and Europe. Additionally, 57
temporary employees have been terminated. All restructuring actions are being
completed in accordance with our established plan. We expect to complete all
restructuring activities related to this plan by the end of the first quarter of
2002. We are conducting all workforce reductions in compliance with all legal
and contractual requirements including obligations to consult with worker
committees, union representatives and others.
Also in the fourth quarter of 2000, we recorded other charges of $15
million, $10 million after tax, or $29 per diluted common share. These charges
related to a strategic decision to reduce some of the aftermarket parts we offer
and to relocation expenses incurred associated with the restructuring plans. The
aftermarket parts were written down to their estimated scrap value less costs to
sell.
In the first quarter of 2001, our Board of Directors approved a
restructuring plan in response to increasingly difficult industry conditions. On
January 31, 2001, we announced plans to eliminate up to 405 salaried positions
worldwide. We recorded pre-tax charges related to the restructuring of $11
million, $8 million after tax, or $21 per diluted common share. Within the
statement of income, $2 million of the pre-tax charge is reflected in cost of
sales, while $9 million is included in selling, general, and administrative
expenses. These charges are comprised of $8 million for severance and related
costs for salaried employment reductions worldwide and $3 million for costs
related to closing a testing facility in North America. As of December 31, 2001,
we have eliminated 300 positions in connection with the first quarter 2001 plan.
We estimate that we will complete these restructuring activities in the first
quarter of 2002. All workforce reductions are being done in compliance with all
legal and contractual requirements including obligations to consult with worker
committees, union representatives and others.
In the second quarter of 2001, our Board of Directors approved a separate
restructuring plan related to closing a North American ride control production
line. We recorded pre-tax charges related to the plan of $8 million, $6 million
after tax, or $16 per diluted common share. Within the statement of income, the
$8 million charge is included in cost of sales. We wrote down the assets to
their fair market value, less costs to sell. As a result of the single purpose
nature of the machinery and equipment to be disposed of, fair value was
estimated to be scrap value less costs to dispose. Cash proceeds from the sale
of these assets were not significant. All restructuring activities related to
this plan have been completed.
In the fourth quarter of 2001, our Board of Directors approved a
restructuring plan, the first phase of a project known as Project Genesis,
designed to lower our fixed costs, improve efficiency and utilization, and
better optimize our global footprint. The plan involves closing eight
facilities, improving the process flow and efficiency through value mapping and
plant arrangement at 20 facilities, relocating production among facilities, and
centralizing some functional areas. The facilities include an aftermarket plant
and an aftermarket distribution operation in Europe, one building at an
emissions control plant complex in North America, a technology facility in North
America, and our London-based treasury office. We expect to eliminate 900
employees as a result of these actions. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we
recorded pre-tax charges related to the plan of $27 million. Within the
statement of income, $23 million of the pre-tax
32 charge is reflected in cost of sales, while $4 million is included in selling,
general and administrative expenses. These charges are comprised of $18 million
in severance and $9 million for equipment lease cancellation, asset impairment,
and other restructuring costs to close the eight facilities. We wrote down the
assets at locations to be closed to their estimated fair value, less costs to
sell. We estimated the market value of buildings using external real estate
appraisals. As a result of the single purpose nature of the machinery and
equipment to be disposed of, fair value was estimated to be scrap value less
costs to dispose in most cases. We also recorded a pre-tax charge of $4 million
in cost of sales related to a strategic decision to adjust some product
offerings and our customer supply strategy in the European aftermarket. The
aftermarket parts were written down to their estimated scrap value, less cost to
sell. Finally, we also incurred $1 million in other restructuring related costs
during the fourth quarter for the value mapping and rearrangement of one of our
emissions control plants in North America. Since these costs relate to ongoing
operations, they could not be accrued as part of the restructuring charge. The
total of all these restructuring and other costs recorded in the fourth quarter
of 2001 was $32 million before tax, $31 million after tax, or $81 per diluted
common share. We expect to complete all restructuring activities related to this
plan by early 2003. We are conducting all workforce reductions in compliance
with all legal and contractual requirements including obligations to consult
with worker committees, union representatives and others.
In addition to the fourth quarter 2001 charges, we expect to incur other
costs during 2002 for moving and rearrangement costs related to Project Genesis
that cannot be accrued as part of the restructuring charge. We currently
estimate these costs will be about $15 million, and they will be expensed as
they are incurred. We also incurred $4 million during 2001 for other
restructuring related costs and expenses such as relocation and moving costs
that could not be accrued as part of our earlier restructuring reserves.
When complete, we expect that the series of restructuring actions initiated
in the fourth quarter of 2001 will generate annualized savings of $30 million.
Amounts related to our restructuring plans, including the plans we
initiated in 2001, 2000 and 1999, are shown in the following table.            DECEMBER 31, 2000                     CHARGED TO  IMPACT OF  DECEMBER 31, 2001

In addition to the announced actions, we are evaluating additional
opportunities, including additional phases of Project Genesis to initiate
actions that will reduce our costs through implementing the most appropriate and
efficient logistics, distribution, and manufacturing footprint for the future.
Any actions that we take will require review and approval by the Board of
Directors and, depending upon the cost of the plans, could require approval by
our senior lenders. See Liquidity and Capital Resources. We plan to conduct
any workforce reductions that result in compliance with all legal and
contractual requirements including obligations to consult with worker
committees, union representatives, and others.
Interest Expense, Net of Interest Capitalized
We reported interest expense of $170 million during 2001, compared to $186
million during 2000. The decrease in our total interest expense is primarily due
to lower interest rates on our variable rate debt. See more detailed
explanations on our debt structure in Liquidity and Capital
Resources -- Capitalization later in this Management Discussion and Analysis.
33   Income Taxes
We recorded a tax expense during 2001 of $51 million. Tax expense for 2001
included a $66 million expense for repatriation of earnings from some of our
foreign subsidiaries. We took this action to better facilitate movement of cash
balances among our overseas subsidiaries while minimizing cash tax payments in
foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate before this change was a 19
percent benefit on our pre-tax loss. The primary reason that this differs from
our statutory tax rate of 35 percent is the non-deductible portion of our
restructuring charges. See Note 6 to the financial statements for a
reconciliation of our tax expense to the statutory rate.
We recorded a tax benefit during 2000 of $27 million, for an effective tax
rate of 41 percent. This benefit was higher than the statutory rate due to the
consolidation of our Mexican entities into one tax entity, allowing us to
recognize some previously unbenefited tax loss carryforwards in Mexico, and due
to the adjustment of tax liabilities in some foreign jurisdictions based on tax
returns filed in the third quarter.
Earnings Per Share
Losses from continuing operations per diluted common share were $343 for
the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $118 per diluted common share in
the prior period. Included in the results for 2001 are the impacts from charges
related to our restructuring plans, the tax charge for repatriation of foreign
earnings, environmental remediation activities and the costs related to the
amendment of certain terms of the senior credit facility in early 2001. The
cumulative negative effect of these items on earnings per diluted common share
was $295 in 2001. The significant pieces of this impact were comprised of the
repatriation of foreign earnings of $173 and the restructuring charges taken in
the first, second and fourth quarters which were $114. Included in the results
for 2000 are impacts from charges related to our restructuring plans, stock
option buyback program, and the reversal of the reserve for transaction costs
related to the November 1999 spin-off of Pactiv. The cumulative negative effect
of these items on earnings per diluted common share was $128. In addition, for
the year ended December 31, 2000, we recorded an extraordinary loss of $002 per
diluted common share due to the early retirement of debt.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
We prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. Preparing our financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. The following paragraphs include a discussion of
some critical areas where estimates are required. You should also review Note 1
to the financial statements for further discussion of significant estimates.
We recognize revenue for sales to our original equipment and aftermarket
customers under the terms of our arrangements with those customers, generally at
the time of shipment from our plants or distribution centers. For our
aftermarket customers, we provide for promotional incentives and returns at the
time of sale. Estimates are based upon the terms of the incentives and
historical experience with returns. We have not experienced any material
differences between these estimates and our actual costs.
We expense pre-production design and development costs incurred for our
original equipment customers unless we have a contractual guarantee for
reimbursement of those costs from the customer. At December 31, 2001 we had $19
million recorded as a long-term receivable from original equipment customers for
guaranteed pre-production design and development arrangements. While we believe
that the vehicle programs behind these arrangements will enter production, these
arrangements allow us to recover our pre-production design and development costs
in the event that the programs are cancelled or do not reach expected production
levels.
34   We have a U.S. Federal tax net operating loss carryforward at December 31,
2001 of $461 million, which will expire in varying amounts from 2019 to 2021.
The federal tax effect of that NOL is $161 million, and is recorded as an asset
on our balance sheet at December 31, 2001. We estimate, based on available
evidence, that it is more likely than not that we will utilize the NOL within
the prescribed carryforward period. Circumstances that could change that
estimate include future U.S. earnings at lower than expected levels or a
majority ownership change as defined in the rules of the U.S. tax law. If that
estimate changed, we would be required to cease recognizing an income tax
benefit for any new NOL, and could be required to record a reserve for some or
all of the asset currently recorded on our balance sheet. For more information
regarding our income taxes, you should read Note 6 to the financial statements.
CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
In April 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
AICPA issued Statement of Position SOP 98-5. Reporting on the Costs of
Start-up Activities, which requires costs of start-up activities to be expensed
as incurred. This statement was effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1998. The statement requires previously capitalized costs related
to start-up activities to be expensed as a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle when the statement is adopted. Prior to January 1, 1999, we
capitalized certain costs related to start-up activities, primarily
pre-production design and development costs for new original equipment
automobile platforms. We adopted SOP 98 -5 on January 1, 1999, and recorded an
after-tax charge for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting
principle of $102 million net of a $50 million tax benefit, or $304 per
diluted common share.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133. Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement establishes new
accounting and reporting standards requiring that all derivative instruments,
including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, be recorded in the
balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. The
statement requires that changes in the derivative fair value be recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Special
accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative gains and losses to
offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement and requires
that a company must formally document, designate, and assess the effectiveness
of transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment. This statement cannot
be applied retroactively and is effective for all fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2000. We adopted this standard, as amended by SFAS No. 138 in June
2000, effective January 1, 2001 and it did not have a significant impact on our
financial position or results of operations.
Effective January 1, 1999, we changed our method of accounting for customer
acquisition costs from a deferral method to an expense-as-incurred method. In
connection with the decision to separate the automotive and specialty packaging
businesses into independent public companies, we determined that a change to an
expense-as-incurred method of accounting for automotive aftermarket customer
acquisition costs was preferable in order to permit improved comparability of
stand-alone financial results with our aftermarket industry competitors. We
recorded an after-tax charge for the cumulative effect of this change in
accounting principle of $32 million net of a $22 million tax benefit, or $95
per diluted common share.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition. This SAB
provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in
the financial statements and is effective no later than the fourth quarter of
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1999. The SAB draws on the existing
accounting rules and defines the basic criteria that must be met before we can
record revenue. The impact of adopting SAB 101 did not have a significant effect
on our results of operations or financial position.
In May 2000, the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a
consensus on Issue No. 00-14, Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives. This
issue addresses the recognition, measurement, and income statement
classification of various types of sales incentives, including discounts,
coupons                     35 rebates, and free products. Consequently, beginning January 1, 2001, we
classified some incentives that were previously shown in selling, general and
administrative expense as a reduction in revenues. As a result of this change,
revenue was $17 million lower for 2001, with an offsetting decline in selling,
general, and administrative expenses. We have restated prior years results for
comparability, resulting in a reduction in net sales of $21 million for 2000 and
$19 million for 1999, with an offsetting reduction in selling, general, and
administrative expense.
In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires that the
purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 changes the accounting for purchased goodwill
from an amortization method to a impairment-only approach. Therefore
amortization of all purchased goodwill, including amortization of goodwill
recorded in past business combinations, will cease upon adoption of SFAS No.
142. SFAS No. 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001. Early adoption of the SFAS No. 142 is not permitted nor is retroactive
application to prior period interim or annual financial statements. At the end
of the year, we had unamortized goodwill of $423 million. Goodwill was amortized
during 2001 at the rate of approximately $17 million. This amount will not be
amortized during 2002 and future years. We are currently evaluating the further
effects that this statement may have on our financial position and results of
operations, including whether or not we will be required to record an impairment
of our goodwill in accordance with the provisions of the new standard. Any
initial impairment attributable to the new standard will be recorded as a change
in accounting principles.
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in
which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The
associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount
of the long-lived asset. SFAS No. 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2002. We will be required to adopt the new standard by January 1,
2003. We are currently evaluating the effect that this statement may have on our
financial position or results of operations.
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS No. 144 addresses
recognition, presentation and disclosure of impairment or disposal of long-lived
assets. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Assets to Be Disposed of and APB Opinion No. 30,
Reporting the Results of Operations -- Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual, and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions, for the disposal of a segment of a business. SFAS No.
144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and interim
periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption encourage. We do not
expect the adoption of SFAS No. 144 to have a material impact on our financial
position or results of operations.

$19 million related to the January 2002 devaluation of the Argentine Peso. The
significant adjustment related to the minimum pension liability resulted from a
decline in the fair value of plan assets. Our valuation date for measuring the
fair value of plan assets is September 30, meaning the value of the assets had
decreased significantly compared to pre-September 11 values.
Short-term debt, which includes the current portion of long-term
obligations and borrowings by foreign subsidiaries as well as our revolving
credit facility, increased by $99 million during 2001. This increase resulted
from higher borrowings of $56 million during 2001 under our revolving credit
facility and a $53 million increase in the amount of long-term debt that will
mature in one year or less. These increases were partly offset by a $10 million
decrease in our foreign subsidiaries' borrowings. The borrowings outstanding
under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2001 were $68 million,
and $12 million as of December 31, 2000. The decline in long-term debt
represents amounts due during 2002. We did not issue any long-term debt during
2001.
Our financing arrangements are primarily provided by a $14 billion
committed senior secured financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks and
other financial institutions. We entered into an agreement to amend this
facility on October 20, 2000 to i relax the financial covenant ratios
beginning in the fourth quarter of 2000, ii exclude up to $80 million of cash
charges and expenses related to cost reduction initiatives from the calculation
of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
EBITDA used in our financial covenant ratios through 2001 and iii make
certain other technical changes. In exchange for these amendments, we agreed to
certain interest rate increases, lowered our capital expenditure limits and paid
an aggregate fee of about $3 million.
As a result of significant reductions in North American vehicle production
levels announced in 2000 by our original equipment customers, as well as an
accelerated weakening of the global aftermarket, we entered into a second
amendment of our senior credit facility on March 22, 2001. The second amendment
revised the financial covenant ratios we were required to maintain as of the end
of each of the quarters ending in 2001. The second amendment also reduced the
limitation on 2001 capital expenditures from $225 million to $150 million, and
required that net cash proceeds from all significant, non-ordinary course asset
sales be used to prepay the senior term loans. In exchange for these amendments,
we agreed to a 25 basis point increase in interest rates on the senior term
loans and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and paid an aggregate
fee of $3 million to consenting lenders. We incurred legal, advisory and other
costs related to the amendment process of $2 million.
At the time of the second amendment, we expected that we would meet with
the senior lenders during the first quarter of 2002 to negotiate further
amendments to the senior credit facility. Consequently, we amended the senior
credit facility for a third time on March 13, 2002. The third amendment revised
the financial covenant ratios we are required to maintain as of the end of each
of the quarters ending in 2002, 2003, and 2004. It also extends the limitation
on annual capital expenditures of $150 million through this three year period.
The amendment further provides us with the option to enter into sale and
leaseback arrangements on up to $200 million of our assets. The proceeds from
these arrangements must be used to reduce senior debt. These senior debt
prepayments would reduce the next scheduled principal amortization payments.
Because the payments on senior debt from sale and leaseback transactions would
be made on a pro-rata basis based on the remaining principal amounts outstanding
on our Tranche A, B, and C senior term loans, but principal amortization
payments are not pro-rata, about 35 percent of any sale and leaseback
transactions we enter into during 2002 would reduce our scheduled principal
amortization. The amendment also allows us to exclude up to $60 million of cash
charges and expenses, before taxes, related to potential future cost reduction
initiatives from the calculation of our financial covenant ratios. It also
permits us to execute exchanges of our senior subordinated bonds for shares of
common stock. We have
37 not currently identified any sale and leaseback transactions that we plan to
complete. However, we may enter into sale and leaseback transactions during
2002. We do not have any current plans to enter into any debt-for-stock
exchanges. Any significant debt-for-stock exchange would require approval of our
shareholders. In exchange for these amendments, we agreed to a $50 million
reduction in our revolving credit facility, a 25 basis point increase in
interest rates on the senior term loans and borrowings under our revolving
credit facility, and paid an aggregate fee of $3 million to consenting lenders.
We also incurred legal, advisory, and other costs related to the amendment
process of $2 million. The 25 basis point increase in interest rates will
increase our interest cost by about $3 million annually.
The senior secured credit facility, as amended on March 13, 2002, consists
of: i a $450 million revolving credit facility with a final maturity date of
November 4, 2005; ii a $361 million term loan with a final maturity date of
November 4, 2005; iii a $269 million term loan with a final maturity date of
November 4, 2007; and iv a $269 million term loan with a final maturity date
of May 4, 2008. Quarterly principal repayment installments on each term loan
began October 1, 2001. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at an annual
rate equal to, at our option, either i the London Interbank Offering Rate plus
a margin of 350 basis points for the revolving credit facility and the term loan
maturing November 4, 2005, 400 basis points for the term loan maturing November
4, 2007 and 425 basis points for the term loan maturing May 4, 2008; or ii a
rate consisting of the greater of the JP Morgan Chase prime rate or the Federal
Funds rate plus 75 basis points, plus a margin of 250 basis points for the
revolving credit facility and the term loan maturing November 4, 2005, 300 basis
points for the term loan maturing November 4, 2007 and 325 basis points for the
term loan maturing May 4, 2008. Under the provisions of the senior credit
facility agreement, the interest margins for borrowings under the revolving
credit facility and the term loan maturing November 4, 2005 may be adjusted
based on the consolidated leverage ratio consolidated indebtedness divided by
consolidated EBITDA as defined in the senior credit facility agreement measured
at the end of each quarter. Our senior secured credit facility does not contain
any terms that could accelerate the payment of the facility as a result of a
credit rating agency downgrade.
The amended senior credit facility requires that we maintain at least the
following consolidated leverage ratios consolidated indebtedness divided by
consolidated EBITDA, consolidated interest coverage ratios consolidated EBITDA
divided by consolidated cash interest paid, and fixed charge coverage ratios
consolidated EBITDA less consolidated capital expenditures, divided by
consolidated cash interest paid at the end of each period indicated                                 QUARTER ENDING

operations that are customary for similar facilities, including limitations on:
a incurring additional liens; b sale and leaseback transactions except for
the permitted transactions described above; c liquidations and dissolutions
d incurring additional indebtedness or guarantees; e capital expenditures;
f dividends; g mergers and consolidations; and h prepayments and
modifications of subordinated and other debt instruments. Compliance with these
requirements and restrictions is a condition for any incremental borrowings
under the senior credit facility agreement and failure to meet these
requirements enables the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans.
As of December 31, 2001, we were in compliance with the financial covenants and
operational restrictions.
Our outstanding debt also includes $500 million of 11 5/8 percent Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2009. The senior subordinated debt indenture requires
that we, as a condition to incurring certain types of indebtedness not otherwise
permitted, maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 225. The
indenture also contains restrictions on our operations, including limitations
on: 1 incurring additional indebtedness or liens; 2 dividends; 3
distributions and stock repurchases; 4 investments; and
38 5 mergers and consolidations. All of our existing and future material domestic
wholly owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee these notes on a
joint and several basis. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of
the subsidiaries that have guaranteed these notes to make distributions to us.
In addition to our senior credit facility and senior subordinated notes, we
also sell some of our accounts receivables off-balance sheet on a periodic
basis. In North America, we have a $100 million accounts receivable
securitization program with a commercial bank. We sell original equipment and
aftermarket receivables on a daily basis under this program. At the end of 2001,
we had sold $68 million of accounts receivable under this program. This program
is subject to cancellation prior to its maturity date if we were to i fail to
pay interest or principal payments on an amount of indebtedness exceeding $50
million, ii default on the financial covenant ratios under the senior credit
facility, or iii fail to maintain certain financial ratios in connection with
the accounts receivable securitization program. This program carries a one-year
renewable term ending in October of 2002. We previously renewed the program in
October 2001. We also sell some receivables in our European operations to
regional banks in Europe. At December 31, 2001, we had sold $42 million of
accounts receivable in Europe. The arrangements to sell receivables in Europe
are not committed and can be cancelled at any time. If we were not able to sell
receivables under either the North American or European securitization programs,
our borrowings under our revolving credit agreement would increase.
We believe that cash flows from operations, combined with available
borrowing capacity described above and, assuming that we maintain compliance
with the financial covenants and other requirements of our loan agreement,
supplemented, if necessary, by proceeds from the sale and leaseback transactions
described above, will be sufficient to meet our future capital requirements for
the following year, including scheduled debt principal amortization payments.
Our ability to meet the financial covenants in 2002 depends upon a number of
operational and economic factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors
that could impact our ability to comply with the financial covenants include the
rate at which consumers continue to buy new vehicles and the rate at which they
continue to repair vehicles already in service, as well as our ability to
successfully implement our restructuring plans. Lower North American vehicle
production levels, weakening in the global aftermarket, or a reduction in
vehicle production levels in Europe, beyond our expectations, could impact our
ability to meet our financial covenant ratios. In the event that we are unable
to meet these revised financial covenants, we would consider several options to
meet our cash flow needs. These options could include further renegotiations
with our senior credit lenders, additional cost reduction or restructuring
initiatives, sales of assets or capital stock, or other alternatives to enhance
our financial and operating position. Should we be required to implement any of
these actions to meet our cash flow needs, we believe we can do so in a
reasonable time frame and at a reasonable cost.

facility and senior subordinated debt indenture described above, all amounts
under those arrangements could, automatically or at the option of the lenders or
other debtholders, become due. Additionally, each of those facilities contains
provisions that certain events of default under one facility will constitute a
default under the other facility, allowing the acceleration of all amounts due.
We currently expect to maintain compliance with terms of all of our various
credit agreements for the foreseeable future.
We have also guaranteed payment and performance of approximately $9 million
of obligations at both December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These
guarantees are primarily related to performance of lease obligations by a former
affiliate.
Dividends on Common Stock
During 2000, the company paid a quarterly dividend of $05 per share of
common stock. These dividend payments total of $7 million in dividend payments
in 2000. On January 10, 2001, we announced that our board of directors
eliminated the quarterly dividend on our common stock. The board took the action
in response to current industry conditions, primarily greater than anticipated
production volume reductions by original equipment manufacturers and continued
softness in the global light vehicle aftermarket. There are no current plans to
reinstate a dividend on our common stock.

MILLIONS
Cash provided used by:
Operating   $141  $234
Investing   126  157
Financing     3  123   Operating Activities
Cash provided from operating activities decreased to $141 million in 2001
as compared to $234 million in 2000. Lower earnings in 2001 was a key driver to
the decrease in cash provided. This was partially offset by our continued focus
on working capital. Reduced accounts receivable and inventory made a favorable
impact on cash flows in the current period compared to the prior year. That
allowed us to use $85 million less cash on working capital before the impact of
sales of accounts receivable during 2001 compared with the prior year. Working
capital, adjusted for receivables that were sold, was $162 million lower than it
was at the end of 2000. During 2001 we increased the size of our European
receivables securitization program by $1 million while we saw our U.S.
receivables securitization program decline by $29 million. In the same period in
the prior year our receivables sales programs in Europe and North America
provided $123 million of cash. We have also entered into arrangements with two
major OE customers in North America under which, in exchange for a discount that
is less than our marginal borrowing cost, payments for product sales are made
earlier than otherwise required under existing payment terms. These arrangements
reduced accounts receivable by $34 million as of December 31, 2001. Included in
our 2001 results is a $7 million pension plan contribution. No contribution was
made in the prior year.
Investing Activities
Cash used by investing activities for continuing operations was $31 million
lower in the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to the same period in 2000.
Capital expenditures were $19 million lower at $127 million in 2001 compared to
$146 million in 2000. In 2000, we increased our ownership percentage in a South
African joint venture for $4 million. We also received cash proceeds of $26
million during 2000                     40 primarily related to the sale of an interest in our Burnley, U.K. exhaust
facility to Futaba. We also invested $10 million in the new joint venture.
Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities was $3 million in 2001. The increase
in 2001 was attributable to a prepayment of long term debt in 2000. Also 2000
includes a $16 million decrease in short term debt and $7 million of dividend
payments to our common shareholders.
OUTLOOK
The outlook for the North American original equipment manufacturers build
rate for light vehicles in 2002 is uncertain. Current estimates range from 145
million units to 155 million units. Despite some strengthening in the U.S.
economy in early 2002, we continue to anticipate that production levels will
decline this year, compared to last year, by about 3 percent to around 15
million units. We are also anticipating that the heavy-duty truck market will
remain weak, with production at about the same level as in 2001. In Europe, we
expect the light vehicle build rate will be down about 1 percent from 2001 to
188 million units. We also expect that economic uncertainty in South America,
mostly attributable to the impact of the devaluation of the Argentine peso, will
result in lower sales in that region of the world. We expect that these trends,
combined with macroeconomic data indicating that consumer confidence,
particularly in the United States, has declined, will have a negative impact on
our business in 2002.
Based on anticipated vehicle production levels our global original
equipment customer book of business is currently $2,353 million, $2,515 million,
and $2,527 million for 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. When we refer to our
book of business, we mean revenues for original equipment manufacturer programs
that have been formally awarded to us as well as programs which we are highly
confident will result in revenues based on either informal customer indications
consistent with past practices and/or our status as supplier for the existing
program and relationship with the customer. This book of business is subject to
increase or decrease due to changes in customer requirements, customer and
consumer preferences, and the number of vehicles actually produced by our
customers however, we do not intend to update the amounts shown above due to
changes after the date of this Form 10-K. In addition, it is based on our
anticipated pricing for the applicable program over its life. However, we are
under continuing pricing pressures from our OE customers. See Cautionary
Statement for Purposes of the 'Safe Harbor' Provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
EURO CONVERSION
The European Monetary Union resulted in the adoption of a common currency,
the euro, among eleven European nations. The euro has been adopted over a
three-year transition period beginning January 1, 1999. In October 1997, we
established a cross-functional Euro Committee, comprised of representatives of
our operational divisions as well as our corporate offices. That Committee had
two principal objectives: 1 to determine the impact of the euro on our
business operations, and 2 to recommend and facilitate implementation of those
steps necessary to ensure that we would be fully prepared for the euro
introduction. As of January 1, 1999, we implemented those euro conversion
procedures that we had determined to be necessary and prudent to adopt by that
date, and we were fully euro ready by the end of the three year transition
period. The costs associated with transitioning to the euro were not material to
our consolidated financial position or the results of our operations.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER MATTERS
We are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and
regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate. We expense or capitalize,
as appropriate, expenditures for ongoing compliance with environmental
regulations that relate to current operations. We expense expenditures that
relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not
contribute to current or future revenue generation. We record liabilities when
environmental assessments indicate that remedial efforts are probable and the
costs can be reasonably estimated. Estimates of the liability are based upon
currently available facts, existing technology, and presently enacted laws and
regulations taking into consideration
41 the likely effects of inflation and other societal and economic factors. We
consider all available evidence including prior experience in remediation of
contaminated sites, other companies' cleanup experience and data released by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency or other organizations. These
estimated liabilities are subject to revision in future periods based on actual
costs or new information. Where future cash flows are fixed or reliably
determinable, we have discounted the liabilities. All other environmental
liabilities are recorded at their undiscounted amounts. We evaluate recoveries
separately from the liability and, when they are assured, recoveries are
recorded and reported separately from the associated liability in our financial
statements.
At December 31, 2001, we continue to be designated as a potentially
responsible party in two Superfund sites. We have estimated our share of the
remediation costs for these sites to be less than $1 million in the aggregate.
In addition to the Superfund sites, we may have the obligation to remediate
current or former facilities, and we estimate our share of remediation costs at
these facilities to be approximately $17 million. For both the Superfund sites
and the current and former facilities, we have established reserves that we
believe are adequate for these costs. Although we believe our estimates of
remediation costs are reasonable and are based on the latest available
information, the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more
information becomes available about the extent of remediation required. At some
sites, we expect that other parties will contribute to the remediation costs. In
addition, at the Superfund sites, the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act provides that our liability could be joint and
several, meaning that we could be required to pay in excess of our share of
remediation costs. Our understanding of the financial strength of other
potentially responsible parties at the Superfund sites, and of other liable
parties at our current and former facilities, has been considered, where
appropriate, in our determination of our estimated liability.
As we previously disclosed, we undertook a third-party evaluation of
estimated environmental remediation costs at one of our facilities beginning in
2000. The evaluation was initiated as a result of testing that indicated the
potential underground migration of some contaminants beyond our facility
property. We completed and analyzed the results of our evaluation of
contamination and migration from that facility. We initially increased the
reserve by $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2000 and $5 million in the first
quarter of 2001. However, after further investigation of alternative remediation
technologies, we were able to identify a more efficient technology and thereby
reduce the reserve by $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2001.
We believe that any potential costs associated with our current status as a
potentially responsible party in the Superfund sites, or as a liable party at
our current or former facilities, will not be material to our results of
operations or consolidated financial position. For additional information
concerning environmental matters, see the caption Environmental Matters under
Note 11 to the Financial Statements of Tenneco Automotive Inc. and Consolidated
Subsidiaries, included as Item 8.
An OE customer has cancelled a platform for which we had a contract to
supply a ride control system. We are currently working with the customer to
recover our investment in development cost and related equipment for this
platform, as well as amounts we owe to some or our suppliers. We are currently
negotiating with our customer for reimbursement of all our costs and with our
suppliers to establish the amounts owed to them in connection with the program
cancellation. While we believe our legal position with the customer is strong,
the customer has not agreed to a full reimbursement of our investment and the
amounts we owe our suppliers. While it is not possible to determine the final
outcome of this issue at this time, if the outcome is unfavorable, we could
incur a loss that would be material to our statement of income in the period in
which this issue is resolved. However, we do not expect that any potential loss
will materially affect our financial position or impact our ability to meet our
debt covenants.
EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS
We have established Employee Stock Ownership Plans for the benefit of our
employees. Under the plans, participants may elect to defer up to 16 percent of
their salary through contributions to the plan, which are invested in selected
mutual funds or used to buy our common stock. Through December 31, 2001, we
matched qualified contributions with a contribution of 75 percent of each
employee contribution
42 up to 8 percent of the employee salary. These matching contributions were made
in company stock and were approximately $10 million and $16 million for the
years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. All contributions vest
immediately. Beginning January 1, 2002, this match was reduced to 50 percent of
each employee contribution up to 8 percent of the employee salary. Matching
contributions will now be made in cash.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We use derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency
forward purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year, to hedge
our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure
to changes in foreign currency rates results from intercompany loans made
between affiliates to minimize the need for borrowings from third parties.
Additionally, we enter into foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts
to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates on certain intercompany
and third-party trade receivables and payables. We have from time to time also
entered into forward contracts to hedge our net investment in foreign
subsidiaries. We do not currently enter into derivative financial instruments
for speculative purposes.
In managing our foreign currency exposures, we identify and aggregate
existing offsetting positions and then hedge residual exposures through
third-party derivative contracts. The following table summarizes by major
currency the notional amounts, weighted average settlement rates, and fair value
for foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts as of December 31,
2001. All contracts in the following table mature in 2002.                                   DECEMBER 31, 2001

INTEREST RATE RISK
Our financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk for changes in
interest rates are our debt securities. We primarily use a revolving credit
facility to finance our short-term capital requirements. We
43 pay a current market rate of interest on these borrowings. We have financed our
long-term capital requirements with long-term debt with original maturity dates
ranging from six to 10 years.
Under the terms of our senior credit facility agreement, we were required
to hedge our exposure to floating interest rates by April 2000 so that at least
50 percent of our long-term debt was fixed for a period of at least three years.
In February 2000, we hedged $250 million of our floating rate long-term debt
with three-year, floating to fixed interest rate swaps. In April 2000, we hedged
an additional $50 million of our floating rate long-term debt with three-year,
floating to fixed interest rate swaps. The hedges that we executed fully satisfy
the interest rate hedging requirement of the senior credit facility agreement.
On December 31, 2001, we had $805 million in long-term debt obligations that
have fixed interest rates until at least January 2003, and $519 million in
long-term debt obligations that have variable interest rates based on a current
market rate of interest.
We estimate that the fair value of our long-term debt at December 31, 2001
was about 72 percent of its book value. A one percentage point increase or
decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease the annual interest
expense we recognize in the income statement and the cash we pay for interest
expense by about $5 million after tax.

Results for 2000 and 1999 have been restated for comparability to reflect
the reclassification of certain sales incentives. We made this reclassification
in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
Emerging Issues Task Force May 2000 consensus on Issue No. 00-14, Accounting for
Certain Sales Incentives. Effective January 1, 2001, we changed the way we
classify some sales incentives in accordance with the consensus reached by the
EITF. The impact of this reclassification on 2000 results was a reduction in net
sales in 2000 and 1999 of $21 million and $19 respectively, with an offsetting
reduction in selling, general and administrative expense.
The increase in revenues from our North American operations is primarily
due to the strong North American original equipment manufacturers' build rates
and the change we made in the first quarter of 2000 with respect to how we
record pass through catalytic converter sales.
In the first quarter of 2000 we changed how we record pass through sales
of some catalytic converter components. Pass through sales occur when we
purchase these components from suppliers, use the components in our
manufacturing process and sell the components to our customers as part of the
completed catalytic converter. In the past, we recorded pass through sales as
a reduction of cost of sales. We now record them as part of net sales.
Relationships with customers had begun to change where we now take title to
these components in the manufacturing process. Additionally, we believed that
our competitors in the automotive parts industry already followed this practice
so this change was consistent with industry practice and permits improved
comparability with these companies. As a result of the change, our North
American sales increased $206 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, with
no impact on our earnings before interest and taxes. Had these components been
recorded on a comparable
44 basis in the year ended December 31, 1999, reported net sales would have been
$140 million higher in that period.
Excluding this change, revenues from our North American operations were
essentially unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to the same
period in 1999. Revenues from our North American original equipment business
increased 1 percent before the pass through sales adjustment. This increase
was due primarily to strong original equipment manufacturer production levels.
Specifically, exhaust unit volume sales to original equipment manufacturers
increased $25 million. The increase in North American exhaust revenues was
partially offset by a decline of $10 million in ride control unit volume sales
to original equipment manufacturers, as well as the build-out of customer
platforms and an increasing decline in heavy duty elastomer sales. Revenues from
our North American aftermarket business declined 3 percent in the year ended
December 31, 2000, compared to the same period in 1999. Exhaust sales to
aftermarket customers decreased $19 million due primarily to the ongoing impact
of declining replacement rates in the industry. Ride control sales to
aftermarket customers increased $6 million primarily as a result of the
introduction of our new premium Monroe ReflexTM shock, which we began selling
in November 1999, and the repositioning of our Sensa-Trac branded products to
the retail market. The ride control increase was partially offset by general
aftermarket weakness.
European revenues increased $12 million for the year ended December 31,
2000, compared to the same period in 1999. A decrease in the value of European
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar reduced sales by $131 million. If foreign
exchange rates had been the same during 2000 as they were in 1999, then our
European revenues would have increased 12 percent. This increase is primarily
due to higher sales to original equipment manufacturers. Specifically, before
the change in currency exchange rates, original equipment exhaust and ride
control sales increased $158 million and $20 million, respectively. Excluding
the currency impact, unit sales from our European aftermarket ride control
operations decreased by $14 million and unit sales from our European aftermarket
exhaust operations decreased by $27 million in the year ended December 31, 2000
from the same period in 1999.
Revenues from our operations in the rest of the world increased 18 percent
in the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to the same period in the prior
year. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, revenues from our South
American operations increased $40 million in 2000 over 1999. Revenues from new
and existing original equipment exhaust programs and stronger aftermarket ride
control operations contributed most of the increase in South American revenues.
Revenues from our Asian operations increased $21 million from the year ended
December 31, 1999 to the same period in 2000. This increase was primarily due to
higher unit sales to original equipment manufacturers in the region. Revenues
from Australian operations decreased $8 million in the year ended December 31,
2000 in comparison to the same period in the prior year. If currency exchange
rates between the Australian dollar and U.S. dollar been the same during the
year ended December 31, 2000 as in the same period in 1999, revenues from our
Australian operations would have increased by $8 million.
EBIT
We reported EBIT of $120 million in 2000 compared to $148 million in 1999.
Each year included costs and charges that have an effect on comparability of the
results and are presented in the tables below. As shown below, these costs and
charges consist of stand-alone costs, restructuring and other charges, one-time
non-operational items, spin-off transaction costs and previously unallocated
Tenneco Inc. expenses. Restructuring and other charges, spin-off transaction
costs and previously unallocated Tenneco Inc. expenses are discussed in the
sections following discussion of our automotive results.
Stand-alone costs were $45 million in 2000 compared to $9 million in 1999.
These costs include the addition of functions necessary for Tenneco Automotive
to operate as an independent public company as well as administrative costs for
information technology, payroll and accounts payable services. For 2000,
approximately $30 million relates to information technology services received
under a contract with Pactiv entered into in connection with the spin-off. The
contract extended for 24 months from date of the spin-off. The remaining amount
relates to payroll and accounts payable functions provided by a third party
45 under a contract that extends for 36 months from the date of the spin-off and
public company functions we added following the spin-off. Before the November,
1999 spin-off, the costs of these services were incurred by Tenneco Inc. but
were not fully allocated to its operating segments. The increase in stand-alone
costs is due to 1999 results including only two months of those costs compared
to 12 months in 2000. While these stand-alone expenses are ongoing, we have
separated the stand-alone expenses reflected in each of our segment 2000
reported results to provide enhanced comparability with the reported results for
each of these segments for 1999.                                YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000

In the preceding table, Other for 2000 includes a $13 million pre-tax
charge for a stock option buy-back program and a $9 million reversal of a
reserve for transaction costs related to the November 1999 spin-off of Pactiv.
The combination of these two one-time, non-operational items reduced our EBIT by
$4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Restructuring and other
represents the $46 million restructuring charge and $15 million in other charges
that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2000. For a detailed description of

Our North American segment incurred $30 million in stand-alone expenses in
the year ended December 31, 2000. Before considering these stand-alone expenses
and restructuring and other charges, our North American EBIT decreased by 22
percent to $142 million in 2000, compared to the prior year. Higher unit volume
sales to North American original equipment manufacturers on new and existing
platforms improved EBIT by $2 million. The heavy duty elastomer market
experienced declines that decreased EBIT by $5 million. We recorded higher
aftermarket ride control unit sales in the first half of 2000 compared to the
first half of 1999, which improved EBIT by $14 million, due primarily to the
launch of our new premium Monroe ReflexTM product. However, we experienced a
decline in aftermarket ride control volumes during the second half of the year,
which decreased EBIT by $4 million. Cost savings from prior restructuring
initiatives and other cost reduction actions improved EBIT at our aftermarket
operations by $28 million. These increases were offset by lower pricing and
volumes in our aftermarket exhaust product lines and the repositioning of our
Sensa-TracR branded products in the retail market, combined, which reduced
EBIT by $29 million. We also incurred $14 million of higher customer acquisition
and promotional expenses associated with the repositioning of our aftermarket
ride control product lines. An unfavorable product mix change in our original
equipment customer base reduced EBIT by $7 million. In the first half of 2000,
we also recorded costs of $9 million associated with the closing of our Culver,
Indiana, OE exhaust plant. Our North American original equipment operations
incurred $4 million in higher selling, general and administrative expenses in
the year ended December 31, 2000, including engineering expenses for advanced
suspension technologies. This was partially offset by savings of $2 million
generated from our fourth quarter 2000 restructuring program. Higher
manufacturing and depreciation expenses in our original equipment operations
contributed the majority of the remaining decrease in North American EBIT.
Our European segment incurred $12 million in stand-alone expenses in the
year ended December 31, 2000. Before considering these stand-alone expenses and
restructuring and other charges, our European EBIT decreased 21 percent to $65
million in 2000. The impact of higher unit volume sales to European original
equipment manufacturers, which improved EBIT by $21 million during 2000, was
partially offset by the negative impact of a change in platform mix, which
reduced EBIT by $7 million during that period. Lower aftermarket unit sales of
both exhaust and ride control products decreased EBIT by $23 million during
2000. Currency weakness in Europe decreased EBIT by $7 million during 2000.
Environmental costs associated with anticipated remediation efforts decreased
EBIT by $4 million in 2000.
Our operations in the rest of the world incurred $3 million in stand-alone
expenses in the second quarter of 2000. Before considering these stand-alone
expenses and restructuring and other changes, EBIT from our operations in South
America, Australia and Asia improved in 2000 to $23 million compared to $12
million in the same period of 1999. The weakening of the Australian dollar
compared to the U.S. dollar during 2000 reduced EBIT by $4 million. Higher unit
sales in Asia combined with cost reduction actions throughout South America,
Asia and Australia offset this to drive the EBIT improvement. The impact of
currency fluctuations in Asia and South America on the translation of financial
results did not contribute materially to the EBIT difference between the year
ended December 31, 2000, and the same period in 1999.
47   EBIT as a Percentage of Revenue
The following table shows EBIT as a percentage of revenue by segment. This
percentage is based on operating unit EBIT which as described above is our
reported EBIT excluding the effects of the stand-alone expenses and
restructuring and other charges.                                YEAR ENDED

5%   7%

Total Tenneco   6%   8   In North America, EBIT as a percentage of revenue decreased by 3 percent.
Excluding the $206 million increase in revenues associated with the change in
revenue recognition of pass-through catalytic converter sales, EBIT as a
percentage of revenue would have been 8 percent for 2000. The decrease in EBIT
margin from 1999 to 2000 was due primarily to a mix shift from higher margin OE
product sales to lower margin OE product sales, the one-time costs associated
with the closing of our Culver, Indiana exhaust plant and product repricings in
both our ride control and exhaust aftermarkets. In Europe, EBIT as a percentage
of revenue decreased by 2 percent from 1999 to 2000 primarily due to lower
aftermarket sales and unfavorable mix changes in both our original equipment and
aftermarket businesses. The increase in EBIT margin from our operations in the
rest of the world was due primarily to the impact of foreign currency
transaction losses experienced by our Brazilian operations during 1999 and our
continued efforts to lower selling, general and administrative expenses in our
South American and Asian operations.
Interest Expense, Net of Interest Capitalized
We reported interest expense of $186 million during 2000, compared to $106
million during 1999. The increase in our total interest expense is due primarily
to the higher debt levels allocated to us as a result of the spin-off of Pactiv
in 1999, higher interest rates due to our lower debt rating, and interest rate
increases during 2000. The debt structure after the Pactiv spin-off is explained
in more detail in Liquidity and Capital Resources earlier in this Management
Discussion and Analysis.
Income Taxes
We recorded a tax benefit during 2000 of $27 million, for an effective tax
rate of 41 percent. This benefit was higher than the statutory rate due to the
consolidation of our Mexican entities into one tax entity, allowing us to
recognize some previously unbenefited tax loss carryforwards in Mexico, and due
to the adjustment of tax liabilities in some foreign jurisdictions based on tax
returns filed in the third quarter.
Our effective tax rate for 1999 was 195 percent. This high effective tax
rate relates primarily to the spin-off transaction. In connection with the
spin-off, we repatriated earnings from some foreign tax jurisdictions. Since our
policy is to reinvest earnings from foreign operations rather than repatriate
them to the U.S., this one-time action resulted in a tax charge in the fourth
quarter of 1999. Finally the 1999 restructuring involves significant activity in
Europe where many of the costs of restructuring will not be deductible for tax
purposes. Consequently, we recognized no tax benefit for these non-deductible
costs.
Earnings Per Share
Losses from continuing operations per diluted common share were $118 for
the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to $187 per diluted common share in
the prior period. In the year ended December 31, 1999, we recorded a loss of
$623 per diluted common share from discontinued operations. In the first
quarter of 1999, we incurred an extraordinary loss of $20 per diluted common
share due to the retirement of debt in connection with the sale of the
containerboard assets. We also recorded an after-tax charge of $400 per diluted
common share due to the cumulative effect of the changes in accounting with
48 respect to start-up activities and customer acquisition costs. In the third
quarter of 2000, we recorded an extraordinary loss of $001 per diluted common
share due to the early retirement of debt.
Option Purchase Offer
On May 8, 2000, we initiated an offer to purchase from our employees stock
options covering approximately 68 million shares of our common stock. These old
stock options were issued before the 1999 spin-off of Pactiv, primarily from
1996 to 1998, by the prior management of Tenneco Inc. By the time of the
spin-off and the change in management of our company, the exercise prices of
these options had become substantially lower than the market price of Tenneco
Inc. common stock. Upon the spin-off, these options held by continuing
employees of our automotive operations were adjusted to maintain their economic
value after giving effect to that transaction. Accordingly, as a newly
independent stand-alone public company we emerged with 68 million underwater
stock options, a large number considering the size of our company and the number
of outstanding shares. Further, we believed that in order to retain and attract
talent in the future, more options would need to be issued. In order to be in a
position to more effectively manage our outstanding equity in the future, we
initiated the purchase offer. Final responses were received from employees in
July 2000. A significant number of employees holding around 6 million options
chose to participate. We recorded a charge and made cash payments for the cost
of this program in the third quarter of 2000. The total cost of the program was
$13 million, before taxes.
Dividends on Common Stock
We paid a dividend of $05 per share of common stock in each of the
quarters in 2000 for a total of $7 million in dividend payments in 2000. On
January 10, 2001, we announced that our board of directors eliminated the
quarterly dividend on the company common stock. The board took the action in
response to current industry conditions, primarily greater than anticipated
production volume reductions by original equipment manufacturers and continued
softness in the global light vehicle aftermarket.

Financing   123  1,495   Operating Activities
Cash provided by continuing operating activities increased by $234 million
for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to the prior year. This
improvement was driven by our increased focus on working capital, which
decreased by $157 million during 2000 in comparison to an increase of $175
million during the same period last year and by sales of receivables. During
2000, the balance of accounts receivable sold increased from $16 million to $139
million, while during 1999 the balance of accounts receivable sold decreased
from $137 million to $16 million. The balance in accounts payable also increased
from $348 million on December 31, 1999 to $464 million on December 31, 2000.
During 2000, we began to take advantage of accounts payable terms versus
discounts. Our accounts payable increased from $337 million on December 31, 1998
to $348 million on December 31, 1999. The remainder of the change in operating
cash flow is primarily due to the change in operating income and accrued income
taxes.
Cash used by our discontinued specialty and paperboard packaging operations
was $253 million in the year ended December 31, 1999.
49   Investing Activities
Cash used by investing activities for continuing operations was $70 million
lower in the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to the same period in 1999.
Capital expenditures were $8 million lower at $146 million in 2000 compared to
$154 million in 1999. During 1999, we used $36 million to acquire businesses,
primarily Kinetic Ltd, an Australian suspension engineering company. In 2000 we
increased our ownership percentage in a South African joint venture for $4
million. We also received cash proceeds of $26 million during 2000, primarily
related to the sale of an interest in our Burnley, U.K. exhaust facility to
Futaba. We also invested $10 million in the new joint venture.
Cash used by investments in discontinued operations was $961 million in the
year ended December 31, 1999. During the second quarter of 1999, Tenneco
acquired for approximately $11 billion certain assets previously used by our
containerboard business under operating leases and timber cutting rights. This
was required in order to complete the April, 1999 sale of our containerboard
business to a newly formed joint venture which remained with Pactiv at the time
of the 1999 spin-off. We also received $306 million in proceeds related to the
containerboard and folding carton sale transactions and $28 million in proceeds
from disposal of assets in our specialty packaging business.
Financing Activities
Cash used by financing activities was $123 million in 2000. This decrease
was primarily due to improved operating and investing cash flows that allowed us
to pay down debt by $123 million. We also issued $17 million of common stock
during the year for employee benefit and dividend reinvestment plans which was
offset by $7 million of common stock dividend payments. During 2000, we also
entered into a capital lease for a new facility in Spain, increasing debt by $17
million.
Cash provided by financing activities was $15 billion during 1999.
Excluding the borrowings required to complete the containerboard sale
transaction, cash used by financing activities was $545 million for 1999. This
primarily reflected the use of the net proceeds of the containerboard sale
transaction to reduce our short-term debt. Before the containerboard sale
transaction, our Packaging division borrowed approximately $18 billion. These
borrowings were used to acquire the assets used under operating leases and
timber cutting rights described under Investing Activities above, and to
purchase the containerboard business accounts receivable. Our Packaging division
remitted the balance of the borrowings to us to retire short-term debt.
Packaging contributed the containerboard business to the new joint venture
subject to the approximately $18 billion in new debt. The debt reduction, which
resulted from this contribution, is shown on the Statements of Cash Flows as a
non-cash financing activity.

Notes to financial   58                     51           REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Tenneco Automotive Inc.   We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Tenneco Automotive Inc.
a Delaware corporation and consolidated subsidiaries see Note 1 as of
December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related statements of income, cash flows,
changes in shareholders' equity and comprehensive income for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial statements and the
schedule referred to below are the responsibility of Tenneco Automotive Inc.
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Tenneco Automotive Inc. and
consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001, and 2000, and the results of
their operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 1999 Tenneco
Automotive Inc. changed its methods of accounting for the costs of start-up
activities and for customer acquisition costs.
Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The supplemental schedule of Tenneco
Automotive Inc. and consolidated subsidiaries is presented for purposes of
complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and is not part of
the basic financial statements. The supplemental schedule has been subjected to
the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements
and, in our opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements
of Tenneco Automotive Inc. and consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole.

57       TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Consolidation and Presentation
Tenneco Automotive Inc. was known as Tenneco Inc. before the spin-off, on
November 4, 1999, of our packaging business to our shareholders, as described in
Note 3. In these notes, when we discuss Tenneco we mean Tenneco Inc. and its
subsidiaries before the spin-off and Tenneco Automotive Inc. and its
subsidiaries after the spin-off.
Our financial statements include all majority-owned subsidiaries. We carry
investments in 20 percent to 50 percent owned companies at cost plus equity in
undistributed earnings since the date of acquisition and cumulative translation
adjustments. We have eliminated all significant intercompany transactions.
In the first quarter of 2000 we changed how we record pass through sales
of some catalytic converter components. Pass through sales occur when we
purchase these components from suppliers, use the components in our
manufacturing process and sell the components to our customers as part of the
completed catalytic converter. In the past, we recorded pass through sales as
a reduction of cost of sales. We now record them as part of net sales.
Relationships with customers had begun to change where we now take title to
these components in the manufacturing process. Additionally, we believed that
our competitors in the automotive parts industry already followed this practice
so this change was consistent with industry practice and permits improved
comparability with these companies. As a result of the change, our sales
increased $274 million and $206 million in the twelve months ended December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively, with no impact on our earnings before interest and
taxes. Had these components been recorded on a comparable basis in the twelve
months ended December 31, 1999 net sales would have been $140 million higher.
Sales of Accounts Receivable
We entered into an agreement during 2000 to sell an interest in some of our
North American trade accounts receivable to a third party. Under this agreement,
as well as individual agreements with third parties in Europe, we had sold
accounts receivable of $110 million and $139 million at December 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively. We recognized a loss of $5 million on these sales of trade
accounts receivable during 2001, representing the discount from book values at
which these receivables were sold to the third party. The discount rate varies
based on funding cost incurred by the third party, and it averaged 54% during
the time period in 2001 when we sold receivables. We retained ownership of the
remaining interest in the pool of receivables not sold to the third party. We
valued this retained interest based on the recoverable value of the receivables
pool, which approximated book value.
Inventories
At December 31, 2001 and 2000, inventory by major classification was as
follows                                2001  2000

Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. A portion
of total inventories 25% and 29% at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively
is valued using the last-in, first-out method. If we had used the first-in,
first-out FIFO method of accounting for these inventories, they would have
been

TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED 18 million and $16 million higher at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
We value all other inventories using the FIFO or average cost methods at the
lower of cost or market value.
Goodwill and Intangibles, net
At December 31, 2001 and 2000, goodwill and intangibles, net of
amortization, by major category were as follows                                 2001  2000
MILLIONS
$423  $458
Other intangible    18    5
$441  $463
Through the end of 2001 goodwill was being amortized on a straight-line
basis over periods ranging from 15 to 40 years. You should read Changes in
Accounting Principles below for information about the new goodwill accounting
requirement. Goodwill amortization amounted to $16 million in 2001 and $17
million in both 2000 and 1999, and is shown separately in the statements of
income with the caption Amortization of goodwill.
We have capitalized certain intangible assets, primarily trademarks and
patents, based on their estimated fair value at the date we acquired them. We
amortize these intangible assets on a straight-line basis over periods ranging
from five to 30 years. Amortization of intangibles amounted to $2 million in
2001 and $3 million in both 2000 and 1999, and is included in the statements of
income caption Depreciation and amortization.
Plant, Property, and Equipment, at Cost
At December 31, 2001 and 2000, plant, property, and equipment, at cost, by
major category were as follows                                2001   2000

Machinery and   1,332  1,340
Other, including construction in progress.   155   200
$1,835  $1,852
We depreciate these properties on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. Useful lives range from 10 to 40 years for buildings
and improvements and from three to 25 years for machinery and equipment.
Notes Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Short and long-term notes receivable outstanding were $50 million and $34
million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the allowance for doubtful accounts on
short- and long-term accounts and notes receivable was $29 million and $24
million, respectively.
Other Long-Term Assets
Beginning on January 1, 1999, we began expensing pre-production design and
development costs as incurred unless we have a contractual guarantee for
reimbursement from the original equipment customer.
59
TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
We had long-term receivables of $19 million and $15 million on the balance sheet
at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, for guaranteed pre-production
design and development reimbursement arrangements with our customers. In
addition, property, plant and equipment includes $35 million and $41 million at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, for original equipment tools and dies
that we own, and prepayments and other includes $32 million and $27 million at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, for in-process tools and dies that we
are building for our original equipment customers. You should also read Changes
in Accounting Principles later in this note for more information.
We capitalize certain costs related to the purchase and development of
software that we use in our business operations. We amortize the costs
attributable to these software systems over their estimated useful lives,
ranging from three to 12 years, based on various factors such as the effects of
obsolescence, technology, and other economic factors. Capitalized software
development costs, net of amortization, were $89 million and $98 million at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Income Taxes
We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby we
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of
temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their
reported amounts in our financial statements. We reduce deferred tax assets by a
valuation allowance when, based upon our estimates, it is more likely than not
that we will not realize a portion of the deferred tax assets in a future
period. The estimates utilized in the recognition of deferred tax assets are
subject to revision in future periods based on new facts or circumstances.
We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on unremitted earnings of foreign
subsidiaries as our present intention is to reinvest the unremitted earnings in
our foreign operations. Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries are
approximately $590 million at December 31, 2001. It is not practicable to
determine the amount of U.S. income taxes that would be payable upon remittance
of the assets that represent those unremitted earnings. We have provided current
tax of $66 million on the current repatriation of certain foreign earnings. You
should read Note 6, Income Taxes for more information.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue for sales to our original equipment and aftermarket
customers under the terms of our arrangements with those customers, generally at
the time of shipment from our plants or distribution centers. For our
aftermarket customers, we provide for promotional incentives and estimated
returns at the time of sale.
Earnings Per Share
We compute basic earnings per share by dividing income available to common
shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. The
computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to the computation of basic
earnings per share, except that we adjust the weighted-average number of shares
outstanding to include estimates of additional shares that would be issued if
potentially dilutive common shares had been issued. In addition, we adjust
income available to common shareholders to include any changes in income or loss
that would result from the assumed issuance of the dilutive common shares.
Allocation of Corporate Debt and Interest Expense
Our practice is to incur indebtedness for our consolidated group at the
parent company level or at a limited number of subsidiaries, rather than at the
operating company level, and to centrally manage various cash functions.
Consequently, for periods prior to the November 4, 1999 spin-off of our
packaging
60
TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
business, our corporate debt has been allocated to discontinued operations based
upon the ratio of the discontinued operations' net assets to our consolidated
net assets plus debt. We have allocated interest expense, net of tax, to our
discontinued operations based on the same allocation methodology. You should
also read Note 3, Discontinued Operations and Extraordinary Loss, for more
information.
Research and Development
We expense research and development costs as they are incurred. Research
and development expenses were $33 million for each of 2001, and 2000, and $32
million in 1999, and are included in the income statement caption Engineering,
research, and development expenses.
Foreign Currency Translation
We translate financial statements of international operations into U.S.
dollars using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and
liabilities and the weighted average exchange rate for each applicable period
for revenues, expenses, and gains and losses. We reflect translation adjustments
in the balance sheet caption Accumulated other comprehensive income loss.
Risk Management Activities
We use derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency
forward purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year, to hedge
our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rate
swaps to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates. Our primary exposure
to changes in foreign currency rates results from intercompany loans made
between affiliates to minimize the need for borrowings from third parties. Net
gains or losses on these foreign currency exchange contracts that are designated
as hedges are recognized in the income statement to offset the foreign currency
gain or loss on the underlying transaction. Additionally, we enter into foreign
currency forward purchase and sale contracts to mitigate our exposure to changes
in exchange rates on some intercompany and third party trade receivables and
payables. Since these anticipated transactions are not firm commitments, we mark
these forward contracts to market each period and record any gain or loss in the
income statement. From time to time we have also entered into forward contracts
to hedge our net investment in foreign subsidiaries. We recognize the after-tax
net gains or losses on these contracts on the accrual basis in the balance sheet
caption Accumulated other comprehensive income loss. In the statement of
cash flows, cash receipts or payments related to these exchange contracts are
classified consistent with the cash flows from the transaction being hedged.
We do not currently enter into derivative financial instruments for
speculative purposes.
Changes in Accounting Principles
In April 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
AICPA issued Statement of Position SOP 98-5. Reporting on the Costs of
Start-up Activities, which requires costs of start-up activities to be expensed
as incurred. This statement was effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1998. The statement requires previously capitalized costs related
to start-up activities to be expensed as a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle when the statement is adopted. Prior to January 1, 1999, we
capitalized certain costs related to start-up activities, primarily
pre-production design and development costs for new original equipment
automobile platforms. We adopted SOP 98-5 on January 1, 1999, and recorded an
after-tax charge for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting
principle of $102 million net of a $50 million tax benefit, or $304 per
diluted common share.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133. Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging
61
TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Activities. This statement establishes new accounting and reporting standards
requiring that all derivative instruments, including derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset
or liability measured at its fair value. The statement requires that changes in
the derivative fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific
hedge accounting criteria are met. Special accounting for qualifying hedges
allows a derivative gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged
item in the income statement and requires that a company must formally document,
designate, and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge
accounting treatment. This statement cannot be applied retroactively and is
effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. We adopted this
standard, as amended by SFAS No. 138 in June 2000, effective January 1, 2001 and
it did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of
operations.
Effective January 1, 1999, we changed our method of accounting for customer
acquisition costs from a deferral method to an expense-as-incurred method. In
connection with the decision to separate the automotive and specialty packaging
businesses into independent public companies, we determined that a change to an
expense-as-incurred method of accounting for automotive aftermarket customer
acquisition costs was preferable in order to permit improved comparability of
stand-alone financial results with our aftermarket industry competitors. We
recorded an after-tax charge for the cumulative effect of this change in
accounting principle of $32 million net of a $22 million tax benefit, or $95
per diluted common share.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition. This SAB
provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in
the financial statements and is effective no later than the fourth quarter of
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1999. The SAB draws on the existing
accounting rules and defines the basic criteria that must be met before we can
record revenue. The impact of adopting SAB 101 did not have a significant effect
on our results of operations or financial position.
In May 2000, the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a
consensus on Issue No. 00-14, Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives. This
issue addresses the recognition, measurement, and income statement
classification of various types of sales incentives, including discounts,
coupons, rebates, and free products. Consequently, beginning January 1, 2001, we
classified some incentives that were previously shown in selling, general and
administrative expense as a reduction in revenues. As a result of this change,
revenue was $17 million lower for 2001, with an offsetting decline in selling,
general, and administrative expenses. We have restated prior years results for
comparability, resulting in a reduction in net sales of $21 million for 2000 and
$19 million for 1999, with an offsetting reduction in selling, general, and
administrative expense.
In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires that the
purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 changes the accounting for purchased goodwill
from an amortization method to a impairment-only approach. Therefore
amortization of all purchased goodwill, including amortization of goodwill
recorded in past business combinations, will cease upon adoption of SFAS No.
142. SFAS No. 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001. Early adoption of the SFAS No. 142 is not permitted nor is retroactive
application to prior period interim or annual financial statements. At the end
of the year, we had unamortized goodwill of $423 million. Goodwill was amortized
during 2001 at the rate of approximately $17 million each year. This amount will
not be amortized during 2002 and future years. We are currently evaluating the
further effects that this statement may have on our financial position and
results of operations, including whether or not we will be required to record an
impairment of our goodwill in accordance with the provisions of the new
standard. Any initial impairment attributable to the new standard will be
recorded as a change in accounting principles.
62
TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an
asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred
if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset
retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset. SFAS No. 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2002. We will be required to adopt the new standard by January 1, 2003.
We are currently evaluating the effect that this statement may have on our
financial position or results of operations.
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS No. 144 addresses
recognition, presentation and disclosure of impairment or disposal of long-lived
assets. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Assets to Be Disposed of and APB Opinion No. 30,
Reporting the Results of Operations -- Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual, and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions, for the disposal of a segment of a business. SFAS No.
144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and interim
periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption encourage. We do not
expect the adoption of SFAS No. 144 to have a material impact on our financial
position or results of operations.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These
estimates include allowances for doubtful receivables, promotional and product
returns, pension and post-retirement benefit plans, income taxes, and
contingencies. These items are covered in more detail in Note 1, Note 6, Note 9,
and Note 11. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications
Prior years' financial statements have been reclassified where appropriate
to conform to 2001 presentations.
2. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
Over the past several years we have adopted plans to restructure portions
of our operations. These plans were approved by the Board of Directors and were
designed to reduce operational and administrative overhead costs throughout the
business. Charges to income related to these plans are recorded in the period in
which the plans are finalized and approved, while actions necessary to affect
these restructuring plans occur over future periods in accordance with
established plans.
The 1999 plan involved closing a ride control manufacturing facility and an
exhaust plant in Europe, closing or downsizing four European aftermarket
distribution centers, closing a North American exhaust manufacturing facility
plus employee reductions of approximately 780. Over 750 employees have been
terminated under the 1999 plan as of December 31, 2001. We have delayed closing
one European aftermarket distribution location as a result of customer
requirements. Actions necessary to complete closing the operation of this
location as an aftermarket distribution center are in process, and we expect to
complete those actions in 2002. However, we have now determined that we will
continue to use the facility in our manufacturing operations. The fourth quarter
2001 restructuring plan described below includes the cost to close a nearby
manufacturing facility. Those operations will be moved to the former
distribution facility and some of the existing workforce will remain. Therefore,
we adjusted the cost to complete the 1999 plan downward by $3 million during the
fourth quarter of 2001, representing primarily severance and
63
TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
other related costs that will no longer be incurred. The reversal is reflected
in cost of sales in the 2001 income statement. This completes all our
restructuring actions related to the 1999 plan.
In the fourth quarter of 2000, our Board of Directors approved a
restructuring plan to further reduce administrative and operational overhead
costs. We recorded, in the fourth quarter of 2000, a pre-tax charge related to
the plan of $46 million, $32 million after tax, or $92 per diluted common
share. Within the statement of income, $13 million of the pre-tax charge is
reflected in cost of sales, while $33 million is included in selling, general,
and administrative expenses. The charge is comprised of $24 million of severance
and related costs for salaried employment reductions worldwide and $22 million
for the reduction of manufacturing and distribution capacity in response to
long-term market trends. The 2000 plan involved closing a North American
aftermarket exhaust distribution facility and a ride control manufacturing plant
in our Asian market, as well as the consolidation of some exhaust manufacturing
facilities in Europe. In addition, the plan involves the elimination of 700
positions, including temporary employees. We wrote down the assets at the
locations to be closed to their estimated fair value, less costs to sell. We
estimated the market value of buildings using external real estate appraisals.
As a result of the single purpose nature of the machinery and equipment to be
disposed of, fair value was estimated to be scrap value less costs to dispose in
most cases. We do not expect that cash proceeds on the sale of these assets will
be significant. As of December 31, 2001, 600 employees have been terminated
under the 2000 plan primarily in North America and Europe. Additionally, 57
temporary employees have been terminated. All restructuring actions are being
completed in accordance with our established plan. We expect to complete all
restructuring activities related to this plan by the end of the first quarter of
2002. We are conducting all workforce reductions in compliance with all legal
and contractual requirements including obligations to consult with worker
committees, union representatives and others.
Also in the fourth quarter of 2000, we recorded other charges of $15
million, $10 million after tax, or $29 per diluted common share. These charges
related to a strategic decision to reduce some of the aftermarket parts we offer
and to relocation expenses incurred associated with the restructuring plans. The
aftermarket parts were written down to their estimated scrap value less costs to
sell.
In the first quarter of 2001, our Board of Directors approved a
restructuring plan in response to increasingly difficult industry conditions. On
January 31, 2001, we announced plans to eliminate up to 405 salaried positions
worldwide. We recorded pre-tax charges related to the restructuring of $11
million, $8 million after tax, or $21 per diluted common share. Within the
statement of income, $2 million of the pre-tax charge is reflected in cost of
sales, while $9 million is included in selling, general, and administrative
expenses. These charges are comprised of $8 million for severance and related
costs for salaried employment reductions worldwide and $3 million for costs
related to closing a testing facility in North America. As of December 31, 2001,
we have eliminated 300 positions in connection with the first quarter 2001 plan.
We estimate that we will complete these restructuring activities in the first
quarter of 2002. All workforce reductions are being done in compliance with all
legal and contractual requirements including obligations to consult with worker
committees, union representatives and others.
In the second quarter of 2001, our Board of Directors approved a separate
restructuring plan related to closing a North American ride control production
line. We recorded pre-tax charges related to the plan of $8 million, $6 million
after tax, or $16 per diluted common share. Within the statement of income, the
$8 million charge is included in cost of sales. We wrote down the assets to
their fair market value, less costs to sell. As a result of the single purpose
nature of the machinery and equipment to be disposed of, fair value was
estimated to be scrap value less costs to dispose. Cash proceeds from the sale
of these assets were not significant. All restructuring activities related to
this plan have been completed.
In the fourth quarter of 2001, our Board of Directors approved a
restructuring plan, the first phase of a project known as Project Genesis,
designed to lower our fixed costs, improve efficiency and utilization, and
better optimize our global footprint. The plan involves closing eight
facilities, improving the process
64
TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
flow and efficiency through value mapping and plant arrangement at 20
facilities, relocating production among facilities, and centralizing some
functional areas. The facilities include an aftermarket plant and an aftermarket
distribution operation in Europe, one building at an emissions control plant
complex in North America, a technology facility in North America, and our
London-based treasury office. We expect to eliminate 900 employees as a result
of these actions. In the fourth quarter 2001, we recorded pre-tax charges
related to the plan of $27 million. Within the statement of income, $23 million
of the pre-tax charge is reflected in cost of sales, while $4 million is
included in selling, general and administrative expenses. These charges are
comprised of $18 million in severance and $9 million for equipment lease
cancellation, asset impairment, and other restructuring costs to close the eight
facilities. We wrote down the assets at locations to be closed to their
estimated fair value, less costs to sell. We estimated the market value of
buildings using external real estate appraisals. As a result of the single
purpose nature of the machinery and equipment to be disposed of, fair value was
estimated to be scrap value less costs to dispose in most cases. We also
recorded a pre-tax charge of $4 million in cost of sales related to a strategic
decision to adjust some product offerings and our customer supply strategy in
the European aftermarket. The aftermarket parts were written down to their
estimated scrap value, less cost to sell. Finally, we also incurred $1 million
in other restructuring related costs during the fourth quarter for the value
mapping and rearrangement of one of our emissions control plants in North
America. Since these costs relate to ongoing operations, they could not be
accrued as part of the restructuring charge. The total of all these
restructuring and other costs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 was $32
million before tax, $31 million after tax, or $81 per diluted common share. We
expect to complete all restructuring activities related to this plan by early
2003. We are conducting all workforce reductions in compliance with all legal
and contractual requirements including obligations to consult with worker
committees, union representatives and others.
In addition to the fourth quarter 2001 charges, we expect to incur other
costs during 2002 for moving and rearrangement costs related to Project Genesis
that cannot be accrued as part of the restructuring charge. We currently
estimate these costs will be about $15 million, and they will be expensed as
they are incurred. We also incurred $4 million during 2001 for other
restructuring related costs and expenses such as relocation and moving costs
that could not be accrued as part of our earlier restructuring reserves.
Amounts related to our restructuring plans, including the plans we
initiated in 2001, 2000 and 1999, are shown in the following table.             DECEMBER 31,                                 DECEMBER 31,

In addition to the announced actions, we are evaluating additional
opportunities, including additional phase of Project Genesis, to initiate
actions that will reduce our costs through implementing the most appropriate and
efficient logistics, distribution, and manufacturing footprint for the future.
Any actions that we take will require review and approval by the Board of
Directors and, depending upon the cost of the plans, could require approval by
our senior lenders. See Liquidity and Capital Resources. We plan to conduct
any workforce reductions that result in compliance with all legal and
contractual requirements including obligations to consult with worker
committees, union representatives, and others.

3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND EXTRAORDINARY LOSS
Background of the Spin-off Transaction
In July 1998, the Board of Directors authorized management to develop a
broad range of strategic alternatives to separate the automotive, paperboard
packaging, and specialty packaging businesses. Subsequently, we completed the
following actions   - In January 1999, we announced an agreement to contribute the
containerboard business to a new joint venture with an affiliate of
Madison Dearborn Partners. The proceeds from the transaction, including
debt assumed by the new joint venture, were approximately $2 billion. The
transaction closed in April 1999. We retained a 43 percent interest in
the joint venture.
- In April 1999, we announced an agreement to sell our folding carton
operations to Caraustar Industries. This transaction closed in June 1999.
The folding carton operations and the containerboard business together
represented our paperboard packaging operating segment.
- On November 4, 1999, we completed the spin-off of the common stock of
Tenneco Packaging Inc., now known as Pactiv Corporation, to our
shareholders. Pactiv included all of the businesses that made up our
specialty packaging segment, as well as our remaining interest in the
containerboard joint venture and our administrative services operations.
As a result of this series of transactions, our former specialty and
paperboard packaging operating segments are presented as discontinued operations
in the accompanying financial statements.
The morning following the spin-off, we completed a reverse stock split that
had been approved by our shareholders at a special meeting held in October 1999.
As a result, every five shares of our common stock were converted into one share
of our new common stock.
Before the spin-off, we realigned substantially all of our existing debt
through a combination of tender offers, exchange offers, and other refinancings.
You should also read Note 4, Long-Term Debt, Short-Term Debt, and Financing
Arrangements for more information.
Discontinued Operations
Our loss from discontinued operations in 1999 was $208 million, comprised
principally of an after-tax loss on sale of the paperboard packaging business of
$207 million. This loss on sale includes a $54 million net loss in the fourth
quarter, reflecting events that occurred subsequent to the April 1999 sale
related to the final settlement of working capital amounts, revisions to
actuarially-determined estimates of pension plan effects, and changes in
estimates regarding liabilities retained by Pactiv.

Extraordinary Loss
During 2000, we recognized extraordinary losses of $1 million net of a $1
million income tax benefit, or $02 per diluted common share, related to the
early retirement of a portion of our long-term debt.
During 1999, an extraordinary loss of approximately $7 million net of a $3
million income tax benefit, or $21 per diluted common share, was recognized
due to the early retirement of debt. As a result of the debt realignment prior
to the spin-off, we recognized an extraordinary loss of approximately $11
million net of a $7 million income tax benefit, or $33 per diluted common
share. This extraordinary loss consists principally of the fair value paid in
the cash tender offers in excess of the historical carrying value for the debt
tendered.

of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
EBITDA used in our financial covenant ratios through 2001 and iii make
certain other technical changes. In exchange for these amendments, we agreed to
certain interest rate increases, lowered our capital expenditure limits and paid
an aggregate fee of about $3 million.
As a result of significant reductions in North American vehicle production
levels announced in 2000 by our original equipment customers, as well as an
accelerated weakening of the global aftermarket, we entered into a second
amendment of our senior credit facility on March 22, 2001. The second amendment
revised the financial covenant ratios we were required to maintain as of the end
of each the quarters ending in 2001. The second amendment also reduced the
limitation on 2001 capital expenditures from $225 million to $150 million, and
required that net cash proceeds from all significant, non-ordinary course asset
sales be used to prepay the senior term loans. In exchange for these amendments,
we agreed to a 25 basis point increase in interest rates on the senior term
loans and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and paid an aggregate
fee of $3 million to consenting lenders. We incurred legal, advisory and other
costs related to the amendment process of $2 million.
At the time of the second amendment, we expected that we would meet with
the senior lenders during the first quarter of 2002 to negotiate further
amendments to the senior credit facility. Consequently, we amended the senior
credit facility for a third time on March 12, 2002. The third amendment revised
the financial covenant ratios we are required to maintain as of the end of each
the quarters ending in 2002, 2003, and 2004. It also extends the limitation on
annual capital expenditures of $150 million through this three year period. The
amendment further provides us with the option to enter into sale and leaseback
arrangements on up to $200 million of our assets. The proceeds from these
arrangements must be used to reduce senior debt. These senior debt prepayments
would reduce the next scheduled principal amortization payments. Because the
payments on senior debt from sale and leaseback transactions would be made on a
pro-rata basis based on the remaining principal amounts outstanding on our
Tranche A, B, and C senior term loans, but principal amortization payments are
not pro-rata, about 35 percent of any sale and leaseback transactions we enter
into during 2002 would reduce our scheduled principal amortization. The
69
TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
amendment also allows us to exclude up to $60 million of cash charges and
expenses, before taxes, related to potential future cost reduction initiatives
from the calculation of our financial covenant ratios. It also permits us to
execute exchanges of our senior subordinated bonds for shares of common stock.
We have not currently identified any sale and leaseback transactions that we
plan to complete. However, we may enter into sale and leaseback transactions
during 2002. We do not have any current plans to enter into any debt-for-stock
exchanges. Any significant debt-for-stock exchange would require approval of our
shareholders. In exchange for these amendments, we agreed to a $50 million
reduction in our revolving credit facility, a 25 basis point increase in
interest rates on the senior term loans and borrowings under our revolving
credit facility, and paid an aggregate fee of $3 million to consenting lenders.
We also incurred legal, advisory, and other costs related to the amendment
process of $2 million. The 25 basis point increase in interest rates will
increase our interest cost by about $3 million annually.
The senior secured credit facility, as amended on March 13, 2002, consists
of: i a $450 million revolving credit facility with a final maturity date of
November 4, 2005; ii a $361 million term loan with a final maturity date of
November 4, 2005; iii a $269 million term loan with a final maturity date of
November 4, 2007; and iv a $269 million term loan with a final maturity date
of May 4, 2008. Quarterly principal repayment installments on each term loan
began October 1, 2001. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at an annual
rate equal to, at our option, either i the London Interbank Offering Rate plus
a margin of 350 basis points for the revolving credit facility and the term loan
maturing November 4, 2005, 400 basis points for the term loan maturing November
4, 2007 and 425 basis points for the term loan maturing May 4, 2008; or ii a
rate consisting of the greater of the JP Morgan Chase prime rate or the Federal
Funds rate plus 75 basis points, plus a margin of 250 basis points for the
revolving credit facility and the term loan maturing November 4, 2005, 300 basis
points for the term loan maturing November 4, 2007 and 325 basis points for the
term loan maturing May 4, 2008. Under the provisions of the senior credit
facility agreement, the interest margins for borrowings under the revolving
credit facility and the term loan maturing November 4, 2005 may be adjusted
based on the consolidated leverage ratio consolidated indebtedness divided by
consolidated EBITDA as defined in the senior credit facility agreement measured
at the end of each quarter. Our senior secured credit facility does not contain
any terms that could accelerate the payment of the facility as a result of a
credit rating agency downgrade.
The amended senior credit facility requires that we maintain at least the
following consolidated leverage ratios consolidated indebtedness divided by
consolidated EBITDA, consolidated interest coverage ratios consolidated EBITDA
divided by consolidated cash interest paid, and fixed charge coverage ratios
consolidated EBITDA less consolidated capital expenditures, divided by
consolidated cash interest paid at the end of each period indicated                                   QUARTER ENDING

a incurring additional liens; b sale and leaseback transactions except for
permitted transactions described above; c liquidations and dissolutions; d
incurring additional indebtedness or guarantees; e capital expenditures; f
dividends; g mergers and consolidations; and h prepayments and modifications
of subordinated and other debt instruments. Compliance with these requirements
and restrictions is a condition for any incremental borrowings under the senior
credit facility agreement and failure to meet these requirements enables the
lenders to require
70
TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
repayment of any outstanding loans. As of December 31, 2001, we were in
compliance with the financial covenants and operational restrictions.
Our outstanding debt also includes $500 million of 11 5/8 percent Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2009. The senior subordinated debt indenture requires
that we, as a condition to incurring certain types of indebtedness not otherwise
permitted, initially maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 225.
The indenture also contains restrictions on our operations, including
limitations on: 1 incurring additional indebtedness or liens; 2 dividends;
3 distributions and stock repurchases; 4 investments; and 5 mergers and
consolidations. All of our existing and future material domestic wholly owned
subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee these notes on a joint and
several basis. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the
subsidiaries that have guaranteed these notes to make distributions to us.
We believe that cash flows from operations, combined with available
borrowing capacity described above and, assuming that we maintain compliance
with the financial covenants and other requirements of our loan agreement,
supplemented, if necessary, by proceeds from the sale and leaseback transactions
described above, will be sufficient to meet our future capital requirements for
the following year, including scheduled debt principal amortization payments.
Our ability to meet the financial covenants in 2002 depends upon a number of
operational and economic factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors
that could impact our ability to comply with the financial covenants include the
rate at which consumers continue to buy new vehicles and the rate at which they
continue to repair vehicles already in service, as well as our ability to
successfully implement our restructuring plans. Lower North American vehicle
production levels, weakening in the global aftermarket, or a reduction in
vehicle production levels in Europe, beyond our expectations, could impact our
ability to meet our financial covenant ratios. In the event that we are unable
to meet these revised financial covenants, we would consider several options to
meet our cash flow needs. These options could include further renegotiations
with our senior credit lenders, additional cost reduction or restructuring
initiatives, sales of assets or capital stock, or other alternatives to enhance
our financial and operating position. Should we be required to implement any of
these actions to meet our cash flow needs, we believe we can do so in a
reasonable time frame and at a reasonable cost.

Based on exchange rates at December 31, 2001 and 2000, the cost of

would not have been material.
Guarantees -- We had guaranteed payment and performance of approximately $9
million of obligations at both December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These
guarantees are primarily related to performance of lease obligations by a former
affiliate.
As of the spin-off, all of our then existing and future material domestic
wholly owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guaranteed the senior
secured credit facility and the senior subordinated notes on a joint and several
basis. You should also read Note 12 where we present the Supplemental Guarantor
Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements.
Interest Rate Swaps -- Under the terms of our senior credit facility
agreement, we hedged our exposure to floating interest rates by entering into
floating to fixed interest rate swaps covering $300 million of our floating rate
debt. The cost of replacing these contracts in the event of non-performance by
the counterparties would not be material. These hedges are effective, so we have
not recognized in earnings any amounts related to the ineffectiveness of the
interest rate swaps. No amounts were excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness. The amount reported in other comprehensive income for these
interest rate swaps will be recognized in income over the remaining period of
the swaps. The swaps expire in early 2003.

As shown by the valuation allowance in the table above, we had potential
tax benefits of $34 million and $30 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively, that we did not recognize in the statements of income when they
were generated. These unrecognized tax benefits resulted primarily from foreign
tax loss carryforwards that are available to reduce future foreign tax
liabilities.
We have a U.S. Federal tax net operating loss carryforward at December 31,
2001 of $461 million which will expire in varying amounts from 2019 to 2021. The
federal tax effect of that NOL is $161 million, and is recorded as an asset on
our balance sheet at December 31, 2001. We estimate, based on available
evidence, that it is more likely than not that we will utilize the NOL within
the prescribed carryforward period. Circumstances that could change that
estimate include unexpected taxable losses or a majority ownership change as
defined in the rules of the U.S. tax law. If that estimate changed, we would be
required to cease recognizing an income tax benefit for any new NOL, and could
be required to record a reserve for some or all of the asset currently recorded
on our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2001, we are aware that there has been
a significant change in ownership, but not a majority change, since the 1999
spin-off of Pactiv.
As of December 31, 2001, for foreign income tax purposes, the company has
$149 million of foreign tax NOLs. Of the $149 million of foreign tax NOLs, $124
million do not expire and the remainder will expire in varying amounts from 2002
to 2011.
We have tax sharing agreements with our former affiliates that allocate tax
liabilities for prior periods.
7. COMMON STOCK
On October 25, 1999, our shareholders approved a reverse stock split
whereby every five shares of our common stock were converted into one share of
our new common stock on the day following the spin-off of Pactiv. In addition,
the stock options outstanding on the date of the spin-off were adjusted such
that
74
TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
employees received options only in the company for which they worked. The number
of shares subject to these options, as well as their exercise prices, were
adjusted so that the options immediately after the spin-off had equivalent
economic terms to the options immediately before the spin-off. Also, on the date
of the spin-off, all restricted stock and units and all performance shares then
outstanding were fully vested. In this note, all share prices and amounts for
periods prior to November 5, 1999, with the exception of the earnings per share
table, are presented before the effect of the spin-off and reverse stock split.
We have authorized 135 million shares $01 par value of common stock, of
which 41,355,074 shares and 37,797,256 shares were issued at December 31, 2001
and 2000, respectively. We held 1,294,692 shares of treasury stock at December
31, 2001 and 1,298,498 shares at December 31, 2000.

The total number of shares of our common stock reserved at December 31,

Tenneco Automotive Inc. Stock Ownership Plan -- In December 1996, we
adopted the 1996 Stock Ownership Plan, which permitted the granting of a variety
of awards, including common stock, restricted stock, performance units, stock
appreciation rights SARs, and stock options to our directors, officers, and
employees. The plan, which terminated December 31, 2001, was renamed the
Tenneco Automotive Inc. Stock Ownership Plan in connection with the spin-off.
In December 1999, we adopted the Tenneco Automotive Inc. Supplemental Stock
Ownership Plan, which permits the granting of a variety of similar awards to our
directors, officers and employees. We can issue up to about 11 million treasury
shares under the Supplemental Stock Ownership Plan. In connection with our 2002
annual meeting of stockholders,we are seeking stockholder approval of a new
long-term incentive plan which will permit granting of a variety of similar
awards to our officers, directors and employees.
Restricted Stock/Units, Performance Units, and Stock Equivalent Units -- We
have granted restricted stock and restricted units to certain key employees.
These awards generally require, among other things, that the employee remains
our employee during the restriction period. We have also granted performance
units to certain key employees that are payable in common stock at the end of
three years after the date of grant based on the attainment of specified
performance goals for the three years. We have also granted stock equivalent
units to certain key employees that are payable in cash annually at the then
current market price of our common stock based on the attainment of specified
performance goals. During 2001, 2000, and 1999, we granted 360,710, 274,719, and
2,705,107 shares and units, respectively, with a weighted average fair value
based on the price of our common stock on the grant date of $337, $770, and
$856 per share, respectively. At December 31, 2001, 247,719 restricted shares
at an average price of $835 per share,
75
TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
466,211 performance units at an average price of $811 per share, 39,076
restricted units at an average price of $856 per unit, and 1,228,256 stock
equivalent units at an average price of $715 per unit were outstanding.
Under the Stock Ownership Plan, we have granted restricted stock and
performance units to each member of the Board of Directors who is not also an
officer. We also granted restricted stock to certain directors in satisfaction
of residual obligations under the discontinued retirement plan for directors.
During 2001, 1,000 performance units per non-employee director were issued under
this plan at the weighted average fair value of our stock on the grant date of
$366 per share. During 2001, 2000 and 1999, 8,000, 1,000 and 6,000 performance
units, respectively, were issued under this plan at a weighted average fair
value of our stock on the grant date of $366, $575 and $856 per share,
respectively. During 2001, 4,828 restricted shares per non-employee director
were issued under this plan at the weighted average fair value of our stock on
the grant date of $319 per share. During 2000, 3,600 restricted shares, were
issued under this plan at a weighted average fair value of our stock on the
grant date of $856. At December 31, 2001, 13,256 restricted shares and 14,835
performance units at an average price of $465 and $573, respectively, per unit
were outstanding under this plan.
Employee Stock Ownership Plans 401k Plans -- We have established
Employee Stock Ownership Plans for the benefit of our employees. Under the plans
participants may elect to defer up to 16% of their salary through contributions
to the plan, which are invested in selected mutual funds or used to buy our
common stock. Through December 31, 2001, we matched qualified contributions with
a contribution of 75% of each employee contribution up to 8% of the employee
salary. These matching contributions were made in company stock and approximated
$10 million and $16 million representing 37 million and 16 million common
shares, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. All contributions vest immediately. Beginning January 1, 2002,
this match was reduced to 50% of each employee contribution up to 8% of the
employee salary. Matching contributions will now be made in cash.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan -- Effective April 1, 1997, we adopted an
Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP that allowed U.S. and Canadian employees
to purchase our common stock at a 15% discount. Each year employees
participating in the ESPP were able purchase shares with a discounted value not
to exceed $21,250. Under the ESPP, we sold 281,056 shares to employees in 1999.
The weighted average fair value of the employee purchase right, which was
estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the assumptions
described below except that the average life of each purchase right was assumed
to be 90 days, was $429 in 1999. The ESPP was suspended in June 1999, in
connection with the reorganization transactions, and terminated during 2000.

recognized after-tax stock-based compensation expense in 2001 of $2 million, in
2000 of $10 million, and in 1999 of $11 million, of which $8 million in 1999
related to restricted stock and performance shares awarded to employees of our
discontinued operations. Had compensation costs for our stock-based compensation
plans been determined in accordance with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, based on the fair value at the grant dates for the
awards under those plans, our pro forma net income and earnings per diluted

which $8 million in 1999 related to employees of our discontinued operations.
Rights Plan
On September 9, 1998, we adopted a Rights Plan and established an
independent Board committee to review it every three years. The Rights Plan was
adopted to deter coercive takeover tactics and to prevent a potential acquiror
from gaining control of us in a transaction that is not in the best interests of
our shareholders. Generally, under the Rights Plan, as it has been amended, if a
person becomes the beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of our outstanding
common stock, each right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the right
exercise price, a number of shares of our common stock or, under certain
circumstances, of the acquiring person common stock, having a market value of
twice the right exercise price. Rights held by the 15 percent or more holder
will become void and will not be exercisable.
In March 2000, we amended the Rights Plan to i reduce from 20 percent to
15 percent the level of beneficial ownership at which the rights became
exercisable, as described above, and ii eliminate the qualified offer terms
of the plan. These terms provided that the rights would not become exercisable
in connection with a qualified offer, which was defined as an all-cash tender
offer for all outstanding common stock that was fully financed, remained open
for a period of at least 60 business days, resulted in the offeror owning at
least 85% of our common stock after consummation of the offer, assured a prompt
second-step acquisition of shares not purchased in the initial offer, at the
same price as the initial offer, and met certain other requirements.
In connection with the adoption of the Rights Plan, our Board of Directors
also adopted a three-year independent director evaluation TIDE mechanism.
Under the TIDE mechanism, an independent Board committee will review, on an
ongoing basis, the Rights Plan and developments in rights plans generally, and,
if it deems appropriate, recommend modification or termination of the Rights
Plan. The independent committee will report to our Board at least every three
years as to whether the Rights Plan continues to be in the best interests of our
shareholders.
Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
Under the Tenneco Automotive Inc. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase
Plan, holders of our common stock may apply cash dividends, if any, and optional
cash investments to the purchase of additional shares of our common stock.

those dates. We have designated and reserved 2 million shares of the preferred
stock as junior preferred stock for the Rights Plan.
9. PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
We have various defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all
of our employees. Benefits are based on years of service and, for most salaried
employees, on final average compensation. Our funding policy is to contribute to
the plans amounts necessary to satisfy the funding requirement of applicable
federal or foreign laws and regulations. Plan assets consist principally of
listed equity and fixed income securities.
We have postretirement health care and life insurance plans that cover a
majority of our domestic employees. For salaried employees, the plans cover our
employees retiring on or after attaining age 55 who have had at least 10 years
of service with us after attaining age 45. For hourly employees, the
postretirement benefit plans generally cover employees who retire according to
one of our hourly employee retirement plans. All of these benefits may be
subject to deductibles, copayment provisions, and other limitations, and we have
reserved the right to change these benefits. Our postretirement benefit plans
are not funded.

in excess of plan assets were $319 million, $286 million, and $200 million,
respectively, as of September 30, 2001, and $44 million, $40 million, and $7
million, respectively, as of September 30, 2000. An additional expense of $1
million was recorded in 1999 related to our December adoption of the Tenneco
Automotive Retirement Plan.
The weighted average discount rates which are based on long-term market
rates used in determining the 2001, 2000, and 1999 actuarial present value of
the benefit obligations were 69%, 73%, and 69%, respectively. The rate of
increase in future compensation was 43%, for each of 2001, 2000, and 1999. The
weighted average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for each 2001,
2000, and 1999 was 94%.
Net periodic postretirement benefit cost from continuing operations for the

The weighted average assumed health care cost trend rate used in
determining the 2001 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 10 declining by 1 percent each year through 2007 and remaining at 5 percent
thereafter. In 2000 and 1999 the health care cost trend rate was 5%.
Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point
in each year would increase the 2001, 2000, and 1999, accumulated postretirement
benefit obligations by approximately $15 million, $11 million, and $13 million,
respectively, and would increase the aggregate of the service cost and interest
cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost by approximately
$2 million each year for 2001, 2000, and 1999.
Decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point
in each year would decrease the 2001 accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation by approximately $13 million and would decrease the aggregate of the
service cost and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement
benefit cost by approximately $2 million.

10. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA INFORMATION
We are a global manufacturer with two geographic reportable segments: North
America and Europe. Each segment manufactures and distributes ride control and
emission control products primarily for the automotive industry. We have not
aggregated individual operating segments within these reportable segments. The
accounting policies of the segments are the same as described in Note 1,
Summary of Accounting Policies. We evaluate segment performance based
primarily on income before interest expense, income taxes, and minority
interest. Products are transferred between segments and geographic areas on a
basis intended to reflect as nearly as possible the market value of the
products. Segment results for 2001, 2000, and 1999 are as follows                                          SEGMENT

Capital Commitments
We estimate that expenditures aggregating approximately $58 million will be
required after December 31, 2001 to complete facilities and projects authorized
at such date, and we have made substantial commitments in connection with these
facilities and projects.
Lease Commitments
We have long-term leases for certain facilities, equipment, and other
assets. The minimum lease payments under non-cancelable leases with lease terms
in excess of one year are                                          SUBSEQUENT

Contingencies
An OE customer has cancelled a platform for which we had a contract to
supply a ride control system. We are currently working with the customer to
recover our investment in development cost and related equipment for this
platform, as well as amounts we owe to some or our suppliers. We are currently
negotiating with our customer for reimbursement of all our costs and with our
suppliers to establish the amounts owed to them in connection with the program
cancellation. While we believe our legal position with the customer is strong,
the customer has not agreed to a full reimbursement of our investment and the
amounts we owe our suppliers. While it is not possible to determine the final
outcome of this issue at this time, if the outcome is unfavorable, we could
incur a loss that would be material to our statement of income in the period in
which this issue is resolved. However, we do not expect that any potential loss
will materially affect our financial position or impact our ability to meet our
debt covenants.
Litigation
We are party to various legal proceedings arising from our operations. We
believe that the outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the
aggregate, will have no material adverse effect on our financial position or
results of operations.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and
regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate. We expense or capitalize,
as appropriate, expenditures for ongoing compliance with environmental
regulations that relate to current operations. We expense expenditures that
relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not
contribute to current or future revenue generation. We record liabilities when
environmental assessments indicate that remedial efforts are probable and the
costs can be reasonably estimated. Estimates of the liability are based upon
currently available facts, existing technology, and presently enacted laws and
regulations taking into consideration
84
TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
the likely effects of inflation and other societal and economic factors. We
consider all available evidence including prior experience in remediation of
contaminated sites, other companies' cleanup experience and data released by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency or other organizations. These
estimated liabilities are subject to revision in future periods based on actual
costs or new information. Where future cash flows are fixed and determinable, we
have discounted the liabilities. All other environmental liabilities are
recorded at their undiscounted amounts. We evaluate recoveries separately from
the liability and, when they are assured, recoveries are recorded and reported
separately from the associated liability in our financial statements.
At December 31, 2001, we continue to be designated as a potentially
responsible party in two Superfund sites. We have estimated our share of the
remediation costs for these sites to be less than $1 million in the aggregate.
In addition to the Superfund sites, we may have the obligation to remediate
current or former facilities, and we estimate our share of remediation costs at
these facilities to be approximately $17 million. For both the Superfund sites
and the current and former facilities, we have established reserves that we
believe are adequate for these costs. Although we believe our estimates of
remediation costs are reasonable and are based on the latest available
information, the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more
information becomes available about the extent of remediation required. At some
sites, we expect that other parties will contribute to the remediation costs. In
addition, at the Superfund sites, the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act provides that our liability could be joint and
several, meaning that we could be required to pay in excess of our share of
remediation costs. Our understanding of the financial strength of other
potentially responsible parties at the Superfund sites, and of other liable
parties at our current and former facilities, has been considered, where
appropriate, in our determination of our estimated liability.
As we previously disclosed, we undertook a third-party evaluation of
estimated environmental remediation costs at one of our facilities beginning in
2000. The evaluation was initiated as a result of testing that indicated the
potential underground migration of some contaminants beyond our facility
property. We completed and analyzed the results of our evaluation of
contamination and migration from that facility. We initially increased the
reserve by $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2000 and $5 million in the first
quarter of 2001. However, after further investigation of alternative remediation
technologies, we were able to identify a more efficient technology and thereby
reduce the reserve by $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2001.
We believe that any potential costs associated with our current status as a
potentially responsible party in the Superfund sites, or as a liable party at
our current or former facilities, will not be material to our results of
operations or consolidated financial position.
12. SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Basis of Presentation
We issued senior subordinated notes due 2009 as a component of a plan to
realign our debt prior to the spin-off. You should also read Note 3,
Discontinued Operations and Extraordinary Loss for further discussion of the
spin-off and debt realignment and Note 5, Financial Instruments for further
discussion of the notes and related guarantee. All of our existing and future
material domestic wholly owned subsidiaries which comprise the Guarantor
Subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee the notes on a joint and
several basis. We have not presented separate financial statements and other
disclosures concerning each of the Guarantor Subsidiaries because management has
determined that such information is not material to the holders of the notes.
Therefore, the Guarantor Subsidiaries are combined in the presentation below.
