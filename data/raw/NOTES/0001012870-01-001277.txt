The Board of Directors and Stockholders
CrossWorlds Software, Inc.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CrossWorlds
Software, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity deficit,
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December
31, 2000. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
statements, we have also audited the financial statement schedule as listed in
the index on page 46. These consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
CrossWorlds Software, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999
and the results of operations and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein.

Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements
1 Organization and Significant Accounting Policies
a Description of Business
CrossWorlds Software, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries the
Company develops, produces, markets and implements business integration
software. The Company is headquartered in Burlingame, California and operates
foreign subsidiaries in Germany, the United Kingdom and France. The majority
of the Company revenues are derived from domestic sales. Substantially all
of the Company sales are made in U.S. dollars.
b Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
c Foreign Currency
The Company considers the functional currency of its foreign subsidiaries
to be the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the foreign subsidiaries' financial
statements are remeasured into U.S. dollars using the historical exchange rate
for non-monetary items and the current exchange rate for monetary items.
Remeasurement gains and losses, as well as transaction gains and losses, are
included in the determination of net loss and have been immaterial to date.
d Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a remaining
maturity on the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash
equivalents, which consist primarily of money market funds and overnight
deposits. Short-term investments principally consist of commercial paper,
government bonds and money-market instruments. Cash equivalents and short-term
investments are stated at cost, which approximates market value.
e Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the respective assets, generally two to five years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset useful life or the
remaining lease term.
f Impairment Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets in
accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment and for Long-
Lived Assets or Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of. When events or changes
in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be
recoverable, the Company recognizes such an impairment in the event the net
book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows
attributable to such assets. No impairment losses were incurred in the periods
presented.
g Software Development Costs
Software development costs associated with new products and enhancements to
existing products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is
established upon completion of a working model. To date, the Company
software development has been completed concurrent with the establishment of
technological feasibility, and, accordingly, no costs have been capitalized.                    30          CROSSWORLDS SOFTWARE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements--Continued
h Concentrations of Credit Risk and Major Customers
The Company cash and cash equivalents are principally on deposit in a
short-term asset management account at a large bank. Accounts receivable
potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk. The
Company customer base is comprised primarily of large companies. The Company
generally does not require collateral for accounts receivable. When required,
the Company maintains allowances for credit losses, and to date such losses
have been within management expectations.
For the year ended December 31, 2000, no customers accounted for more than
10% of the Company total revenue. One customer accounted for 21% of accounts
receivable as of December 31, 2000. For the year ended December 31, 1999, one
customer accounted for 21% of the Company total revenue and one customer
individually accounted for 44% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 1999.
For the year ended December 31, 1998, three customers accounted for 14%, 13 and 11% of the Company total revenue.
i Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of the Company cash, short-term investments, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, and borrowings approximate their carrying values
due to their short maturity.
j Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
k Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants' AICPA Statement of Position 97-2, Software
Revenue Recognition. When contracts contain multiple elements, wherein vendor
specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements, the Company
accounts for the delivered elements with the Residual Method prescribed by
AICPA Statement Of Position 98-9, Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect
to Certain Arrangements. The Company software arrangements typically
involve significant production, customization, or modification of the
software, or services that are essential to the functionality of the software
and, as a result, software license revenue for the entire arrangement is
generally recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. Progress
toward completion is measured by achieving certain standard and objectively
verifiable milestones present in each project. These milestones typically
require customer acceptance of a deliverable. In certain instances, the
Company may recognize software license revenue upon delivery when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed and determinable,
acceptance is certain, collection is probable, and the Company is not involved
in significant production, customization, or modification of the software or
services that are essential to the functionality of the software. In the event
costs to complete a contract are expected to exceed anticipated revenue, a
loss is accrued. In certain circumstances where the Company is unable to
estimate the amount of effort required to customize or implement the software
license, revenue is recognized using the completed-contract method. To date,
no amounts have been recognized under the completed contract method.
Consulting and service revenue is recognized as the services are performed.
Maintenance revenue from customer support and product upgrades, including
maintenance bundled with original software licenses, are deferred and
recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement, typically
twelve months. When the Company enters into software arrangements
31          CROSSWORLDS SOFTWARE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements--Continued
with resellers, the Company does not recognize revenue until the reseller
demonstrates it has entered into an arrangement with an end user that
satisfies the Company revenue recognition criteria. When the Company
services are essential to the end user implementation of the software sold by
the reseller, the software license revenue for the arrangement is recognized
using the percentage-of-completion method.
l Accounts Receivable
The Company bills for software licenses and maintenance fees at the
inception of the contract. These arrangements typically allow the Company to
bill amounts in excess of revenue recognized. Amounts billed in excess of
revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. Consulting and service
fees are billed monthly based on time and expenses incurred. The Company
contracts typically do not contain retainage provisions and all amounts due
under the contracts are anticipated to be collected within 12 months. At
December 31, 2000 and 1999, there were no accounts receivable that were
subject to contract claims or uncertainties.
m Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans using the
intrinsic value method. Deferred stock-based compensation expense is recorded
if, on the date of grant, the current market value of the underlying stock
exceeds the exercise price. The Company amortizes deferred stock-based
compensation in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 28.
The Company uses the fair value method to account for stock options and
other equity instruments issued to nonemployees.
n Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method.
Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates
applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax
assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits
for which future realization is uncertain.
o Comprehensive Loss
The Company does not have any components of comprehensive income,
consequently comprehensive loss consists entirely of net loss for all periods
presented.
p Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications, none of which affected net loss, have been made
to prior year balances in order to conform to the current year presentation.
q Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of
outstanding shares of common stock, excluding common stock subject to
repurchase. Diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted-average
number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential
common shares from options and warrants to purchase common stock and common
stock subject to repurchase using the treasury stock method, and from
convertible securities using the as-if converted basis. All potential common
shares have been
32          CROSSWORLDS SOFTWARE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements--Continued
excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for all periods
presented because the effect would have been antidilutive.
Diluted net loss per share does not include the effect of the following

and Hedging Activities SFAS 133. SFAS 133 establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as
derivatives, and for hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize
all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial
position and measure those instruments at fair value. For a derivative not
designated as a hedging instrument, changes in the fair value of the
derivative are recognized in earnings in the period of change. The statement,
as amended, is effective for fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2000. The Company will adopt the standard during the first
quarter of fiscal year 2001. Management does not believe the adoption of SFAS
133 will have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

two equipment facilities agreements the equipment facilities, which provided
for $100 million and $20 million working capital facilities with a bank. In
January 1999, the Company had entered into a $50 million credit facility as a
subordinated loan and security agreement the subordinated loan agreement.

Outstanding borrowings under the equipment facilities agreements are
secured by all of the Company assets. The working capital facility agreement
contains affirmative and negative covenants requiring, among other things, the
Company to maintain minimum levels of liquid assets, limit the Company
ability to incur additional debt, pay cash dividends, or to purchase certain
assets. These covenants require the Company to restrict certain acquisitions,
mergers, consolidations, or similar transactions. In 1999, the Company issued
warrants to purchase 6,334 shares of common stock to the bank in exchange for
waivers of noncompliance with these covenants. The fair value of the warrants
is not material to the Company consolidated operating results. As of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, all amounts drawn under the working capital
facility were repaid. In June 2000, the working capital facility was extended
to June 2001.
In connection with the subordinated loan and security agreement, the
Company issued a warrant to the lender to purchase up to 126,666 shares of
Series E preferred stock at an exercise price of $600 per share. The warrant
had a fair value of $05 million on the date of grant, computed using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: 60%
volatility, zero dividends, a risk-free rate of 61% and a contractual life of
7 years. The fair value of the warrant has been recorded in equity and as a
reduction of the carrying amount of the related debt and will be amortized
into interest expense over the debt term. Total amortization expense for each
year ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 was $02 million. In October 2000, the
warrants were exercised as a cashless transaction, which resulted in aggregate
net issuance of 80,558 common shares.

a Lease Commitment
The Company leases its primary facility under a noncancelable operating
lease expiring in 2008. The Company also leases various facilities which serve
as sales offices in the United States, and subsidiary offices in France,
Germany, and the United Kingdom under noncancelable operating leases with
various expiration dates through 2006. In addition, the Company leases
equipment under noncancelable operating leases expiring in December 2001. In
conjunction with the facility lease, the Company issued a warrant in 1998 for
the purchase of 33,333 shares of Series C preferred stock at an exercise price
equal to $600 per share. The fair value of the warrant was not material to
the Company 1998 consolidated operating results. In May 2000, the warrants
were exercised as a cashless transaction, which resulted in net issuance of
13,333 shares.

ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was approximately $29 million, $20
million, $15 million, respectively.
b Royalty Commitments
During 1999, the Company entered into a royalty agreement with a third
party vendor for certain licensed technology. The agreement included a minimum
royalty payment of approximately $20 million due through June 2000.
During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company developed and began shipping
products, which replaced the technology provided under the agreement
associated with the minimum royalty payments of $20 million due by June 2000.
As a result, the Company discontinued use of this licensed technology and
recorded a one-time charge to other expense for the remaining $10 million of
unamortized minimum royalties.
During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company entered into a royalty
agreement with another third party vendor for certain licensed technology. The
agreement with this vendor required a $10 million prepayment against future
usage and also includes remaining minimum royalty prepayments of approximately
$10 million due through June 2001.

of approximately $19 million.
b Reverse Stock Split
On October 1, 1999, the Company Board of Directors authorized a 1 for 3
reverse stock split. The accompanying consolidated financial statements and
related notes have been retroactively restated to give effect to the reverse
stock split.
c Common Stock
The Company has issued 2,550,597 shares of common stock to founders and
employees under restricted stock purchase agreements. Pursuant to the
agreements, except in certain cases pertaining to executive officers, the
Company has the right to repurchase the unvested common stock at its original
purchase price in the event of voluntary or involuntary termination of the
stockholder for any reason. The repurchase rights expire through the year
2001. Shares subject to repurchase totaled approximately 70,000, 155,000,
681,000 as of December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
d Stock Option Plan
The Company is authorized to issue up to 15,373,630 shares in connection
with its 1996, 1997, 1999 and 2000 stock option plans the Plans to
directors, employees, and consultants. The Plans provide for the issuance of
stock purchase rights, incentive stock options, or nonstatutory stock options.
Stock purchase rights are subject to a restricted stock purchase agreement
whereby the Company has the right to repurchase the stock at the original
issue price upon the voluntary or involuntary termination of the purchaser
employment with the Company. The repurchase rights will lapse at a rate
determined by the stock plan administrator, but at a minimum rate of 20% per
year.
Under the 1997 plan, the exercise price for incentive stock options is at
least 100% of the stock fair market value on the date of grant for employees
owning less than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock, and at least
110% of the fair market value on the date of grant for employees owning more
than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock. For nonstatutory stock
options, the exercise price is also at least 110% of the fair market value on
the date of grant for service providers owning more than 10% of the voting
power of all classes of stock and no less than 85% of the fair market value on
the date of grant for service providers owning less than 10% of the voting
power of all classes of stock.
Options generally expire in 10 years; however, they may be limited to 5
years if the optionee owns stock representing more than 10% of the Company.
Vesting periods are determined by the stock plan administrator and generally
provide for shares to vest over a 4-year period, with 125% of the award
vesting after 6 months from the date of grant and then ratably vesting each
month thereafter.

Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements--Continued  The Company uses the intrinsic value method to account for its fixed option
plans issued to employees. Deferred stock-based compensation cost has been
recognized for its stock option plan for grants to employees when the fair
value of the underlying common stock on the grant date exceeds the exercise
price for each stock option. Deferred stock-based compensation is amortized
using the accelerated method set forth in Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 28. Had compensation cost for the Company stock-based
compensation plan been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123 for all of the

e Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In January 2000, the board of directors approved the Company 2000
Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan. The purchase plan became
effective upon the completion of the initial public offering in June 2000. The
Company had reserved a total of 750,000 shares of common stock for issuance
under the Purchase Plan, and the number of shares reserved for issuance will
be subject to an automatic annual increase on the first day of each fiscal
year beginning in 2001 and ending in 2005.
The Purchase Plan, which is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the
Internal Revenue Code, will be implemented in a series of overlapping offering
periods of approximately 24-month durations. New offering periods other than
the first offering period will begin on May 1 and November 1 of each year.
Each offering period will consist of four consecutive purchase periods of
approximately six-month duration. The initial offering period commenced on
June 1, 2000 and ends on April 30, 2002. The initial purchase period ended on
October 31, 2000.
The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock
through payroll deductions, which may not exceed 15% of an employee
compensation, at a price equal to the lower of 85% of the fair market value of
the Company common stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the
end of each purchase period. Employees may end their participation in the
offering at any time during the offering period. Participation automatically
ends on termination of employment with the Company.
No employee can purchase more than 1,500 shares of common stock in one
purchase period or stock having a value measured at the beginning of the
offering period greater than $25,000 in any calendar year. An employee
38          CROSSWORLDS SOFTWARE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements--Continued
is not eligible to participate in the plan if the employee owns stock or holds
outstanding options to purchase stock equaling 5% or more of the total voting
power or value of all classes of the Company stock or stock of its
subsidiaries.
The weighted-average fair value of shares issued under the Purchase Plan in
fiscal 2000 was $651.
f Warrants
In October 1999, the Company issued 177,098 warrants to acquire common
stock at $660 a share, to an executive search firm for the recruitment of its
chief executive officer. The warrants are immediately exercisable up to seven
years from the date of issuance. The warrants had a fair value of $08 million
on the date of the grant, which was recorded as an operating expense in 1999.
The fair value of the warrants was calculated using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following assumptions: 60% volatility, zero dividends,
a risk-free rate of 521% and a contractual life of seven years. These
warrants were not exercised as of December 31, 2000.
In February 2000, the Company issued 199,996 warrants to acquire common
stock at $1100 a share, to certain of its Board members in consideration of
their commitment to provide funding of up to $100 million, if necessary,
through the earlier of December 31, 2000 or the Company initial public
offering. The warrants were immediately exercisable and expire in five years
from the date of issuance. The warrants had a fair value of $14 million on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following assumptions: 60% volatility, zero dividends, a risk-free rate of
55% and a contractual life of five years. The fair value of the warrants was
initially recorded as a current asset to be amortized over the eleven-month
funding period. Following the completion of the Company initial public
offering, the remaining unamortized asset was expensed. As of December 31,
2000, 181,816 warrants were exercised for an aggregated amount of $20
million.

$702 million respectively, available to reduce future income subject to
income taxes. The federal net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning
2011 through 2020. The state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning
2003 through 2020 depending on the state in which they are generated.
At December 31, 2000, the Company also had research credit carryforwards
for federal and California income tax return purposes of approximately $21
million and $11 million respectively, available to reduce future income
subject to income taxes. The federal research credit carryforward expires
beginning in 2011 through 2015. The California research credit carries forward
indefinitely.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 and the California Conformity Act of 1987 impose
restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards
in the event of an ownership change as defined by the Internal Revenue Code.
Should an ownership change occur in the future, the Company ability to
utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to
restriction pursuant to these provisions.
