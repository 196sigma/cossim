Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December31, 2003 1. Significant Accounting Policies and Other Matters Organization aaiPharma Inc. aaiPharma or the Company is a science-based specialty
pharmaceutical company focused on the commercialization of branded
pharmaceutical products that the Company acquires or develops. The Company also
has a comprehensive range of pharmaceutical development capabilities primarily
in the United States and Europe. In 2003 and 2002, the majority of the
Companys net revenues came from the sale of commercial pharmaceutical
products. Prior to 2002, the majority of the Companys net revenues were earned
in its development services business. Major customers for the Companys
pharmaceutical products are large, well-established medical wholesalers and
distributors. Major customers for the development services and product
development businesses are large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies. Basis of Presentation and Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of aaiPharma Inc.
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions have
been eliminated. Certain balances in the prior years consolidated financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the December31, 2003
presentation. On January30, 2003, aaiPharmas Board of Directors approved a three-for-two
stock split of the Companys common shares. On March10, 2003, each
stockholder received one additional share of common stock for every two shares
they owned on the record date of February19, 2003. All share and per share
amounts have been restated to reflect the stock split for each period presented
as if it had occurred at the beginning of the period. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements The Company has restated its consolidated statements of operations, cash flows,
stockholders equity and comprehensive income for the year ended December31,
2002 and its consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2002. In addition,
the restatement affects the first, second and third quarters of 2002 and 2003.
The restated amounts for these quarters are presented in Note 13. The
restatement does not affect periods prior to 2002. The restatement corrects
the Companys accounting treatment of certain transactions that did not satisfy
all of the conditions of SFAS 48 or were subsequently deemed to involve
subjective determinations for which the Company has determined alternative
accounting treatments should be used. Set forth below are the restatement
adjustments included in the restatement of the previously issued financial
statements for the year ended December31, 2002. The following table presents the impact of the restatement adjustments
described below on net income for the year ended December31, 2002 89

The adjustments to restate the 2002 and 2003 quarterly periods relate to the
following ifor 2003, the correction of the Companys revenue recognition of certain
transactions, including specific product sales in 2003, that did not satisfy
all of the conditions for recognition of revenue under SFAS 48 and/or SAB 101,
as well as significant increases in reserves for product returns and other
adjustments to the Companys revenue and product inventory reserves, and iifor 2002 and 2003 a change
in the accounting treatment used with respect
to the Companys product line acquisitions from accounting for the acquisitions as
business combinations to recording such transactions as asset acquisitions.
Accordingly the Company adjusted the related allocations to reverse the
recording of goodwill and allocate all amounts specifically to identifiable
tangible and intangible assets see note 2. The following table presents the impact of the restatement adjustments on the
Companys previously reported results for the year ended December31, 2002 on a

Subsequent Events NASDAQ Delisting The Company received notice on March30, 2004 from the NASDAQ Stock Market
that, due to the delay in filing of its Form10-K for the fiscal year ended
December31, 2003, the Company is not in compliance with certain NASDAQ
marketplace rules and that its common stock would be subject to delisting at
the opening of business on April8, 2004, unless the Company request a hearing
pursuant to NASDAQ rules. The Company requested and participated in a hearing
before NASDAQ on April29, 2004 in which it committed to filing this Report on
Form10-K on or before June15, 2004 and to file amended quarterly Reports on
Form10-Q for each of the three quarters of 2003 on or before June30, 2004.
The Company has not received notification of the outcome of the delisting
hearing. On May18, 2004, the Company received notice from the NASDAQ Stock
Market that the Company was delinquent on the filing of its Form10-Q for the
period ended March31, 2004. Credit Ratings Downgrade On March31, 2004, each of Moodys Investors Service and Standard Poors
Ratings Services announced that it had lowered the Companys corporate credit
rating: Moodys to Caa2 from B2 and Standard Poors to CCC from B. At the
same time, Moodys lowered its rating of aaiPharmas senior subordinated notes
to Ca from Caa1 and aaiPharmas senior unsecured issuer rating to Caa3 from
B3. Standard Poors lowered its senior secured debt rating to CCC from BB and its subordinated debt rating to CC from B-. 91 Senior Credit Agreement and Indenture Defaults aaiPharma did not file its Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended
December31, 2003 the 2003 Form10-K in the time required by the federal
securities laws. This failure to file the 2003 Form10-K constituted an event
of default under its former senior credit agreement, dated as of March28, 2002
as amended, the Credit Agreement, with Bank of America, N.A. as
administrative agent in such capacity, the Administrative Agent. Due to
this and other events of default under the Credit Agreement, the Company was
advised by the Administrative Agent that the Company was not permitted to make
any borrowings under the $100million revolving credit facility portion of the
Credit Agreement. On April23, 2004, aaiPharma refinanced the Credit Agreement with $140million
of senior credit facilities with a syndicate of lenders, Silver Point Finance
LLC as collateral agent, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent
the Restructured Facility. The Restructured Facility consists of a
two-year, $125million senior secured term loan facility which was fully drawn
at closing and a two-year, $15million senior secured revolving credit
facility. M.V.I. and Aquasol Sale On April26, 2004, the Company sold its M.V.I. and Aquasol product lines to
Mayne Pharma USAInc. for $105million, subject to adjustments based on
inventory levels at closing and other post-closing obligations the M.V.I. and
Aquasol Sale. A portion of the closing payment is held in escrow to satisfy
post-closing obligations under the agreement. At the closing of the
transaction, the Company paid to AstraZeneca AB the $315million payment due
in August2004 see Note 2, which was discounted to approximately $310
million as a result of the early payment the M.V.I. Payment. Royalties Receivable The Company entered into a definitive agreement to receive a prepayment of
certain royalties receivable the Accelerated Royalties, that would
otherwise have been paid to it quarterly through the second quarter
of 2005 pursuant to the development agreement discussed below under
Revenue Recognition Product Development.
These royalties would have aggregated $154million. The agreement to receive a
prepayment of these royalties discounted the Accelerated Royalties by 5% per
annum from the date originally due to the advance payment date. The Company
received approximately $150million in gross proceeds from the Accelerated
Royalties in April2004. Termination of Interest Rate Hedging Obligation At December31, 2003 aaiPharma was a party to an interest rate hedging
agreement to effect a swap of its fixed interest rate on a notional amount of
the Companys 11% senior subordinated notes the Notes, see Note 6 to a
floating interest rate. The Company terminated the interest rate hedging
agreement. The Companys termination obligations under this interest rate
hedging agreement were approximately $94million, which were paid in full on
April26, 2004. Governmental Investigations and Litigation In April2004, the Company received subpoenas for document production and
potential testimony issued by a grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the
Western District of North Carolina related primarily to 2002 and 2003 financial
information, certain loans obtained by it, extensions of credit, and other
information. The Company has also been advised by the Office of the United
States Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina that it may receive
a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC. In addition,
the Company and certain of its current and former officers and employees have
been named as defendants in multiple purported class action lawsuits commenced
by stockholders and retirement plan participants beginning in February2004
alleging violations of federal securities laws and ERISA. 92 Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the SECs Staff Accounting
Bulletin No101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements as amended by
Staff Accounting Bulletin No104 together, SAB 101, and FASB Statement No.
48 Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists SFAS 48. SAB 101
states that revenue should not be recognized until it is realized or realizable
and earned. Revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the
following criteria are met: 1persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;
2delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3the sellers
price to the buyer is fixed and determinable; and 4collectibility is
reasonably assured. SFAS 48 states that revenue from sales transactions where
the buyer has the right to return the product shall be recognized at the time
of sale only if 1the sellers price to the buyer is substantially fixed or
determinable at the date of sale, 2the buyer has paid the seller, or the
buyer is obligated to pay the seller and the obligation is not contingent on
resale of the product, 3the buyers obligation to the seller would not be
changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product,
4the buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart
from that provided by the seller, 5the seller does not have significant
obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the
product by the buyer, and 6the amount of future returns can be reasonably
estimated. Net Revenues The Companys net revenues represent the Companys total revenues less
allowances for customer credits, including estimated discounts, rebates,
chargebacks, product returns and non-research and development expenses
reimbursed by customers. Net revenues are reported for the Companys three operating segments, which are
product sales, development services and product development. Product Sales The Company recognizes revenues for product sales at the time title and risk of
loss are transferred to the customer, and the other criteria of SAB 101 and
SFAS 48 are satisfied, which is generally at the time products are shipped.
Product shipping and handling costs are included in product cost of goods sold.
Products are sold to pharmaceutical wholesalers, the largest three of which
account for approximately 81% and 88% of the Companys sales revenues for the
years ended December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. At the time gross
revenue is recognized from product sales, an adjustment, or decrease, to
revenue for estimated chargebacks, rebates, discounts and returns is also
recorded. These revenue reserves are determined on a product-by-product basis.
Revenue reserves are established by management as its best estimate at the
time of sale based on each products historical experience adjusted to reflect
known changes in the factors that impact such reserves. Reserves for
chargebacks, rebates and related allowances are established based on the
contractual terms with customers; analysis of historical levels of discounts,
chargebacks and rebates; communications with customers and purchased
information about the rate of prescriptions being written and the levels of
inventory remaining in the distribution channel as well as expectations about
the market for each product and anticipated introduction of competitive
products. The reserve for chargebacks is the most significant estimate used in
the recognition of revenue from product sales. Contract prices are established
for certain indirect customers that are supplied by the Companys wholesale
customers. A chargeback represents the difference between the current
published wholesale acquisition cost and the indirect customers contract
price. If the actual amount of cash discounts taken, chargebacks, rebates and
expired product returns differ from the amounts estimated by management,
material differences may result from the amount of revenue the Company
recognizes from product sales. 93 In the case of shipments made to wholesalers that do not meet the revenue
recognition criteria of SFAS 48, and SAB 101, such shipments are accounted for
using the consignment model. Product shipments accounted for under the
consignment model currently include the Companys new product launches in 2003
and product shipments through a new specialty distributor, which began in the
third quarter of 2003. Under the consignment model, the Company does not
recognize revenue upon shipment of product. For these product sales, the
Company invoices the wholesaler, records deferred revenue at gross invoice
sales price, and classifies the inventory held by the wholesaler as consigned
inventory at the Companys cost of goods for such inventory. The Company
recognizes revenue on consigned inventory when such inventory is sold through
to the wholesalers customers, on a first-in first-out FIFObasis. The
Companys estimates of inventory at the wholesalers and deferred revenue on
consigned inventory are based on 1the projected prescription demand-based
sales for its products, 2the Companys analysis of third-party information,
including information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their
inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research
data, and 3the Companys internal product sales information. The Companys
estimates are subject to the inherent limitations of estimates that rely on
third-party data, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of
estimates, and reflect other limitations. The Companys sales and revenue
recognition for such consigned inventory reflect the Companys estimates of
actual product sold through to the wholesale customer. As of December31, 2003,
deferred product revenues under the consignment model were $457million. Prior to 2003, the amount of actual product returns experienced by the Company
had not been significant. As a result, actual returns were charged against
revenue in the period they occurred and aggregate revenue reserves were
evaluated quarterly to determine if they were sufficient to cover estimated
chargebacks, rebates and related allowances, as well as the expected rate of
returns, and adjusted as deemed necessary. In 2003, the Company began
segregating the Companys products return reserve, which prior thereto the
Company believed was adequately covered by the Companys aggregate revenue
reserves for chargebacks, rebates and related allowances. The Company
increased the level of detail included in the Companys analyses to include
analyzing inventory in the channel to determine remaining shelf life. The
Companys returns reserve needs are primarily related to the number of months
of inventory estimated to be in the distribution channel. Levels of inventory
in the distribution channel are monitored and estimated based on information
the Company purchases from the wholesalers, combined with active discussions
between the Companys sales personnel and the wholesalers to which the Company
supplies. In addition, the Companys actual sales, returns and chargeback
history are used to assess the reasonableness of the estimated number of months
of inventory on hand at the Companys wholesalers. The shelf life of products
remaining in the distribution channel is estimated based on an analysis of each
lot sold. Each batch has a specific expiration date. A review of the actual
returns history is performed and the run rate of sales out of the distribution
channel is estimated. Estimated product returns reserves are adjusted based on
these reviews. Reserves may also be adjusted to reflect any significant
changes in trends or based upon new information that the Company believes may
affect the reserve needs. Allowances for new product introductions are
estimated based on the Companys experiences for similar products that the
Company currently markets and are adjusted as deemed necessary based on the
Companys experience with each product. The Companys reserve analysis also
includes a review for the potential introduction of generic competition and the
resulting impact on pricing and returns reserves. Existing reserves may be
adjusted accordingly to reflect the Companys estimate for any impact these
factors may have. aaiPharma continually monitors its assumptions with respect
to the Companys revenue reserves for product sales and modifies them if
necessary. 94 Product Development The majority of the product development segments revenues consist of
licensing, milestone and royalty payments from the Companys proprietary
technology. The provisions for licensing, milestone and royalty payments
included in contracts are related to the occurrence of specific identifiable
events. Each of the licensing agreements is reviewed to determine the
appropriate revenue recognition treatment under SAB 101 and EITF 00-21 Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverable Arrangements. The Company recognizes
revenues from licensing fees over the estimated life of the agreement to which
the licensing fees relate or when the commitment to perform services under the
agreement has been fulfilled. Milestone payments are recognized as revenue
when the milestone has been achieved, the performance obligation has been met
and collection of the milestone-related revenue to be recognized is probable.
The Company recognizes recurring royalties revenue in the period in which the
related product sales occur or, in the case of the development
agreement discussed below, in the period the matching contractual
obligation is performed. The Company has a development agreement with a customer that provides for it to
receive contingent periodic royalties and obligates the customer to use the Company on a fee-for-service basis for a
product life cycle management project related to the product. The customer is
a major pharmaceutical company with net assets in excess of $20billion. The
development agreement relates to a product with respect to which the Company
has licensed intellectual property that it developed in the past. The Company
has recognized product development revenues under this agreement for the
periodic payments based on its customers sales of the product, and have
recognized development services revenue related to the product life cycle
management project. Product development revenues from this agreement were $130
million in 2003, $169million in 2002 and $149million in 2001. The Company
recognized no research and development expense in 2003, 2002 and 2001
associated with the payments it received in those years. The expense of its
work associated with these revenues was recognized primarily in 1997 through
1999. The Company does not anticipate incurring significant expense associated
with the product development revenues under this agreement in future periods.
Development services revenue associated with this agreement were $27million
in 2003, $47million in 2002 and $63million in 2001. Because of the research
and development nature of its activities in this product life cycle management
project and the potential that these activities could result in continuation of
product development revenues into the future, the Company has recorded its
costs incurred in this project as research and development expense$10
million in 2003, $07million in 2002 and $23million in 2001. Accordingly,
for its development services business unit, the Company has recognized no
expense associated with the development services revenue arising under this
agreement, as this expense was recognized by its product development business
unit. The
Company is entitled to receive these periodic royalties based on sales of
the customers product only if it makes available exclusively to its customer
its product development and reformulation services with respect to a limited
group of drugs that include the customers product. This obligation does not
prevent the Company from engaging in these development and reformulation
activities for products that it may develop for itself. As the Company remains available to provide the customer with these services on
this basis in a calendar quarter, it will be entitled to royalties based on the
level of sales over a prior monthly period of the product. The customer is
obligated to make these quarterly payments based on whether defined market
events have occurred in the prior measurement monthe.g., if the defined
market events have not occurred during three consecutive months, the Company
would be entitled to royalties in three consecutive quarters, with, for
example, the amount of the royalties in the first quarter being based on product
sales in the first month. However, if it does
not continue to provide these development and reformulation services on the
exclusive basis described above in any quarter, it will not be entitled to
the royalties for that quarter and all subsequent quarters. Under the agreement,
the Company has the right, at any time, to terminate its obligation to provide
the development and reformulation services on an 95 exclusive basis. Accordingly, the Company does not recognize product
development revenues under this agreement in any quarter until it has satisfied
the exclusivity requirement for that quarter. Development Services The Company recognizes the majority of its development services revenues from
fee-for-service contracts on a proportional performance basis as the work is
performed. To measure performance, the Company compares actual direct costs
incurred to estimated total contract direct costs, which is the best indicator
of performance of the contract obligations as the costs directly relate to the
labor hours incurred to perform the service. This ratio is multiplied by the
estimated contract value to determine the revenue to be recognized. The
proportional performance method requires an estimate of total expected revenue
and at no time under this method are costs deferred. These estimates are
reviewed periodically and, if these estimates change or actual results differ
from expected results, an adjustment is recorded in the period in which they
become reasonably estimable. These adjustments could have a material effect on
the Companys results of operations. Historically, there have not been
significant variations between contract estimates and actual costs incurred.
Changes in the scope of work generally result in an amendment to contract
pricing terms. Amended contract amounts are not included in net revenues until
signed change orders are executed, revenue is earned and realization is
assured. The Company also recognizes revenue on a time and materials basis in
accordance with the specific contract terms. Revenues recognized prior to
contract billing terms are recorded as work in progress. The majority of the Companys arrangements with customers are not
multiple-element arrangements. However, due to the proprietary nature of
product formulations, the Company has entered into a limited number of
multiple-element arrangements related to product development activity. During
2003, the Company adopted EITF 00-21 and has applied its criteria to such
arrangements in determining the separability of elements and timing of revenue
recognition under SAB 101. Provisions for losses on contracts, if any, are recognized when
identified. Clients generally may terminate services at any time. However,
the majority of contracts contain provisions that require payment for all
services rendered to date, even those services that had not yet been billed.
In the specific cases where these termination provisions are not specifically
defined in the contract, the Company ensures that the future billing milestones
are achievable and within the Companys control prior to recognition of revenue
under such arrangements The
following table sets forth the Companys gross revenues and the amount of dilution to
revenues resulting from revenue reserves such as allowances for customer
credits, including discounts, rebates, chargebacks, product returns and other
allowances for each of 2003, 2002 and 2001

Income Taxes 96 Income taxes have been accounted for using the liability method in accordance
with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No109 Accounting for Income Taxes. This approach
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets
or liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is
more likely than not that these items will either expire before the
Company is able to
realize their benefit or if future deductibility is uncertain. Developing the
provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in
federal and state income tax laws, regulations and strategies, including the
determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and, if necessary, any
valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets. The
Companys judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing
authorities. While the Company believes that it has provided adequately for its
income tax liabilities in its consolidated financial statements, adverse
determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect
on the Companys consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Research and Development Costs The Company engages in numerous research and development RD projects with
the objective of growth and utilization of its portfolio of proprietary
technologies and patent and intellectual property rights to bring products to
market or to license or sell these technologies to others. RD expenses
represent direct salaries of RD personnel, raw material expenses, third-party
consulting and testing costs, along with an allocation of indirect costs such
as management and administrative overhead costs and facilities costs. RD costs
are charged to expense as incurred. Although there is a risk that any specific
RD project may not produce revenues, the Company believes that the potential
profit margins from successful development projects will compensate for costs
incurred for unsuccessful projects. The Company is currently involved in many
pharmaceutical and technology development projects and believes that these
activities help to diversify its RD portfolio and manage its risk. Advertising The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred, and these costs are
included in selling expenses. Advertising costs were $80million, $45
million and $09million for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Loss Earnings per Share Basic lossearnings per share is based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted lossearnings per share is
computed assuming that the actual weighted average number of common shares
outstanding was increased by the exercise of stock options issued to employees
and members of the Companys Board of Directors under the treasury stock
method. The diluted per share amounts reflect a change in the number of shares
outstanding the denominator to include the options as if they were
exercised and converted to shares and issued, unless their inclusion would be
anti-dilutive. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, 1,890,548, 2,296,001 and 824,378
options were excluded as they were anti-dilutive. In each year presented, the
net lossincome the numerator is the same for both basic and diluted per
share computations. The following table provides a reconciliation of the denominators for the basic
and diluted earnings per share computations 97

Concentration of Credit Risk The Company is subject to a concentration of credit risk with respect to its
accounts receivable balance, all of which is due from wholesalers, distributors
and large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. At December31,
2003, approximately 29% of the accounts receivable balance represented amounts
due from one customer. At December31, 2002, approximately 18% and 17 respectively, of the accounts receivable balance represented amounts due from
two customers. At December31, 2001, no single customer accounted for more
than 10% of the Companys accounts receivable balance. The Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains reserves for
potential uncollectible accounts. Actual losses from uncollectible accounts
have been minimal. In 2003, three customers accounted for approximately 17%, 15% and 12 respectively, of the Companys revenues In 2002, three customers accounted for
approximately 19%, 18% and 12%, respectively, of the Companys revenues. One
customer accounted for approximately 15% of the Companys revenue in 2001. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity
of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Work-in-Progress Work-in-progress represents revenues recognized prior to contract billing
terms. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first-in,
first-out basis or market. 98 Property and Equipment Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Depreciation is recognized using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Depreciable lives are 315years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 15
years for equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of
the asset life or the lease term. Goodwill and Other Intangibles, Net For the years ended December31, 2001 and 2000, goodwill, defined as the excess
of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired
businesses, was amortized over 20years. In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
SFAS 142, the Company ceased amortization of goodwill as of January1,
2002. In accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
141, Business Combinations SFAS 141, for purchase business combinations
consummated subsequent to June30, 2001, goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment on an
annual basis or as impairment indicators are identified. Goodwill amortization
for the year ended December31, 2001 was $06million. At December31, 2003
and 2002, the amounts for accumulated amortization of goodwill were
approximately $40million and $34million, respectively. The change in
accumulated goodwill amortization from December31, 2002 to December31, 2003
is due to foreign currency exchange rate changes. Other identifiable
intangible assets are amortized, if applicable see Note 2, on a straight-line
basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 20years. At
December31, 2003 and 2002, the amounts of accumulated amortization of
identifiable intangibles were approximately $202million and $104million,
respectively. The changes in the carrying value of goodwill which is entirely in the
Development Services operating segment for the year ended December31, 2003 are

The total intangible asset amortization expense for the year ended December31,
2003, was $126million, of which $123million is product related and is
included in direct costs and $03million, which is included in depreciation
and amortization expenses. Amortization expense for the next five years is
estimated to be approximately $19million per year. In December2001, the Company acquired the Brethine product line, as further
discussed in Note 2. In early 2004, generic versions of this product were
approved by the FDA. In December2003, the Company performed an analysis of
the carrying value of the intangible assets associated with the product, based
on discounted cash flows using its updated assumptions, and determined that
they were impaired. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $159
million. In July2003, the Company acquired the rights to a product marketed under the
Darvocet A500 brand name. The Company initially valued these rights at $47
million, and recorded such value as an intangible asset to be amortized over
its estimated useful life. As a result of a delay in market acceptance of the
Darvocet A500 product and other changes in market condition for these products,
the Company evaluated the intangible asset carrying value at December31, 2003.
Based on a discounted cash flows analysis of this intangible as of December
31, 2003, the Company determined that the value was fully impaired and wrote
off the unamortized balance of $47million as intangible asset impairment on
the consolidated statements of operations. 100 On a periodic basis, or as otherwise required, the Company assesses the value
of its goodwill, intangibles and other assets by determining their ability to
recover the unamortized balances over the remaining useful lives. Goodwill,
intangibles and other long-lived assets determined to be unrecoverable are
written-off in the period in which such determination is made. The Company has
changed its annual test date from December31st to October 1st for testing
whether goodwill is impaired. This change is both preferable and allowed in
that choosing the 1st day of the 4th quarter allows adequate time to perform
the first step of the test and, if necessary, the second step of the test while
still providing time to report the impact of the test in the Companys periodic
filings. The Company will test goodwill for impairment as of October 1st of
each fiscal year, or more frequently should circumstances change or events
occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit
below its carrying amount, as provided for in SFAS No142. Foreign Currency Translation The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries have been translated into U.S.
dollars in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No52
Foreign Currency Translation. All balance sheet accounts have been translated
using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates. Income statement
amounts have been translated using the average exchange rates for the
respective years. The gains and losses resulting from the changes in exchange
rates from year to year have been reported in accumulated other comprehensive
income lossincluded in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity. Derivative Financial Instruments aaiPharma used an interest rate hedging agreement to modify its fixed rate
obligation under the Notes to a variable rate obligation, thereby adjusting the
interest rate to the current market rate and ensuring that the hedged notional
amount of the debt instrument is always reflected at fair value. The Company
follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended SFAS 133, to
account for its interest rate swap using hedge accounting treatment. As of
December31, 2003, the Company had outstanding one interest rate hedging
agreement to convert a portion of fixed rate debt to a floating rate basis,
thus hedging for changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt being hedged.
The Company has determined that this interest rate hedging agreement,
designated as a fair value hedge, qualifies for treatment under the short-cut
method of measuring effectiveness. Under the provisions of SFAS 133, this hedge
is determined to be perfectly effective, and there is no requirement to
periodically evaluate effectiveness. See Note 6 for additional details on the
outstanding interest rate hedging agreement. This interest rate hedging
agreement was terminated in April2004. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
145, Rescission of FASB Statements 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement
No13, and Technical Corrections SFAS 145. SFAS 145 no longer requires
companies to report gains or losses associated with the extinguishment of debt
as a component of extraordinary gains or losses, net of tax. In addition, any
extraordinary gains or losses on extinguishment of debt in prior periods
presented would require reclassification. As required by SFAS 145, the
extraordinary loss recognized in the year ended December31, 2002 of
approximately $81million $53million net of tax to record the write-off of
deferred financing and other costs related to its prior debt facilities has
been reclassified to other expense. 101 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No146, Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities SFAS 146, requires that a
liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized
when the liability is incurred rather than when a commitment to an exit plan is
made. SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated
after December31, 2002. Adoption of this statement did not have a material
effect on its financial position or results of operations. In January2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No46 FIN 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 requires an investor
with a majority of the variable interests primary beneficiary in a variable
interest entity VIEto consolidate the entity and also requires majority and
significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures. A VIE
is an entity in which the voting equity investors do not have a controlling
interest, or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the
entitys activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support
from other parties. Effective December2003, the FASB issued Staff Position
FIN 46R that defers the application of FIN 46 to interests in potential VIEs if
the VIE was created prior to February 1 2003 and the company has not issued
financial statements reporting interests in VIEs in accordance with FIN 46
until the end of periods ending after March15, 2004. The Company adopted FIN
46 in fiscal 2003 and the adoption did not have a significant impact
on the Companys
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards will not
have a material impact on the Company. Employee Stock-Based Compensation The Company follows Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and related Interpretations in accounting
for its employee stock options as permitted by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS
123 and makes the pro forma disclosures required by SFAS 123, as amended by
SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure. The fair value for stock options was estimated at the date of grant using a
Black-Scholes pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the stock
options is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period. The grant date Black-Scholes weighted average fair value of options
issued at market price was $1319, $1149 and $890 per share for 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively, and the weighted average fair value of options issued
in excess of market price was $994 per share in 2002. No options were issued
in excess of market price in 2003 or 2001. 102 The Company applies APB 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for its
stock option plans; therefore, compensation expense has not been recognized for
options granted at fair value. If compensation cost for the Companys stock
option plans had been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for
awards under those plans consistent with the fair value method of SFAS 123, the
Companys net lossincome and earnings lossper share would have been
changed to the pro forma amounts indicated below. Pro forma compensation
expense under SFAS 123 is based on the single award method recorded on a
straight-line basis.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
work-in-progress and current liabilities approximate fair values as of December
31, 2003 and 2002. Based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company,
the carrying value of the variable rate debt approximated fair value. The fair
market value of the Companys fixed rate debt is based on market quotations.
At December31, 2003 and 2002, the fair market value of the Companys fixed
rate debt was approximately the carrying value. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The most
significant estimates relate to revenue reserves and sales allowances,
including reserves for chargebacks, product returns, rebates and related
allowances, an allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves and useful
lives for intangible assets. Actual results could differ from such estimates
and changes in such estimates may have a material affect on amounts reported in
future periods. 103 2. Asset Acquisitions On December2, 2003, the Company acquired a line of pain management products,
which treat moderate to severe pain, the New Pain Products and existing
inventory from subsidiaries of Elan Corporation, plc, in an asset purchase.
The product lines acquired are marketed under the Roxicodone, Oramorph SR,
Roxanol and Duraclon brand names. The Company acquired these product lines and
related intangible assets for $1025million, exclusive of transactional costs.
To finance this acquisition, which included $51million of inventory, the
Company used the proceeds from its then-existing senior term loan credit
facility, as described in Note 6. Revenues from the sales of these products are
included in the Companys results of operations beginning on the acquisition
date. The New Pain Products did not have separable assets and liabilities
associated with them, other than inventory. Therefore the Company allocated
the purchase price, including acquisition related expenses, to acquired
identifiable tangible and intangible assets. Based on this allocation, $98
million of intangible assets have been identified and will be amortized over 20
years. The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information reflects
the results of operations for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002 as if
the acquisition of the New Pain Products had occurred at the beginning of the
periods presented.

These pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do
not purport to be indicative of what operating results would have been had the
acquisition taken place at the beginning of the period presented. In addition,
these results are not intended to be a projection of future results. On August5, 2003, aaiPharma and CIMA LABS INC., CIMA entered into a merger
agreement. The completion of the merger was subject to several conditions,
including the approval of the merger by the stockholders of CIMA and aaiPharma
and the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and contained customary
termination rights by each party in the event of higher unsolicited offers by a
third party. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company announced the
termination of the merger agreement by CIMA in light of a competing offer for
CIMA by a third party. As a result, the Company received an $115million
termination fee from CIMA, as provided in the terminated merger agreement,
against which $59million of merger-related fees and expenses were applied.
The net amount of $56million is included in other income on the consolidated
statements of operations. On March28, 2002, the Company acquired the U.S. rights to the Darvon and
Darvocet branded product lines, which treat mild-to-moderate pain, and existing
inventory from Eli Lilly and Company, in an asset purchase. The Company
acquired these product lines and related intangible assets for $2114million,
exclusive of transactional costs. To finance this acquisition, which included
$18million of inventory, the Company used the proceeds from the then existing
senior secured credit facilities and senior subordinated notes, as described in
Note 6. Revenues from the sales of these products are included in the Companys
results of operations beginning 104 on the acquisition date. The Darvon and Darvocet product lines did not have
separable assets and liabilities associated with them, other than inventory,
therefore the Company allocated the purchase price, including acquisition
related expenses, to acquired identifiable tangible and intangible assets. The
identified intangible assets are amortized over 20years. In December2001, the Company acquired from Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation
and Novartis Corporation a line of asthma products used in the prevention and
reversal of bronchospasm in patients age 12 and older with asthma and
reversible bronchospasm associated with bronchitis and emphysema, in an asset
purchase. The product line acquired is marketed under the Brethine brand name.
The Company acquired this product line and related intangible assets for $266
million, exclusive of transactional costs. To finance this acquisition, the
Company used the proceeds from a $25million term loan, which was refinanced in
March2002 by a senior secured credit facility as described in Note 6, and used
working capital to pay the remainder of the purchase price. Revenues from the
sales of these products are included in the Companys results of operations
beginning on the acquisition date. The Brethine product line did not have
separable assets and liabilities associated with it, therefore the Company
allocated the purchase price, including acquisition related expenses, to
acquired identifiable intangible assets, which are being amortized over 20
years. In August2001, the Company completed the acquisition of a line of critical
care injectable and oral nutrition products from AstraZeneca AB, an affiliate
of AstraZeneca PLC, in an asset purchase. The product lines acquired are
marketed under the M.V.I. and Aquasol brand names. The Company acquired these
product lines and related intangible assets for $525million, exclusive of
transactional costs, paid at closing, plus additional consideration described
below. To finance the initial payment for this acquisition, which included
$37million for inventory, the Company used the proceeds from a term loan,
which was refinanced by a senior secured credit facility as described in Note
6. The product line acquisition agreement was amended in July2003. As
amended, it provided for two $10million guaranteed payments, which were made
in August2002 and 2003, eliminated a contingent payment of $20million that
was potentially due in August2003 under the original agreement, and provided
for a future contingent payment of $435million potentially due in August
2004, depending on the status of certain reformulation activities being carried
out by the seller and regulatory approval of the reformulations by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration FDA. The amount of the $435million contingent
payment was to be reduced by $1million per month if the conditions for the
contingent payment had not occurred by December31, 2002. The amount of the
contingent payment had decreased by $120million by December31, 2003. Such
conditions were satisfied in January and February2004, fixing the previously
contingent liability under the amendment at $315million. As a result of the
July2003 amendment to the original purchase agreement, the Company was
precluded from recognizing this obligation as additional purchase price for the
M.V.I. and Aquasol product line. As of December31, 2003, this contingent
obligation had not been recorded as a liability on the Companys consolidated balance
sheet and will be recorded as a liability and as an other expense in the first
quarter of 2004. Also in July2003, the M.V.I. supply agreement with the
seller was extended through 2008, subject to early termination rights by the
Company on six months notice given at any time, and by the supplier on
twenty-four months notice given at any time on or after August17, 2004.
Revenues from the sales of these products are included in the Companys results
of operations beginning on the acquisition date. The M.V.I. and Aquasol
product lines did not have separable assets and liabilities associated with
them, other than inventory; therefore the Company allocated the purchase price,
including acquisition related expenses, to acquired identifiable tangible and
intangible assets. In connection with the M.V.I. and Aquasol acquisition, the Company recorded
intangible assets which meet the criteria for having an indefinite life. In
accordance with SFAS 142, these intangible assets are not being 105 amortized but are evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis. The
intangible assets recorded in connection with this acquisition represent the
trademarks, technology and know-how associated with the product lines. On April26, 2004, the Company sold the M.V.I. and Aquasol product lines to
Mayne Pharma USAInc., for $105million subject to certain adjustments based
on inventory levels at closing and other post-closing obligations. A portion
of the closing payment is held in escrow to satisfy the Companys post-closing
obligations under the agreement. At the closing of the transaction, aaiPharma
paid to AstraZeneca AB the $315million payment due in August2004, which was
discounted to approximately $310million the M.V.I. Payment. Royalties on
sales levels of the new M.V.I. product formulation above specified thresholds
will be paid to the Company as part of this agreement. During July2001, the Company made an initial payment of $09million to
acquire the assets of a sterile manufacturing facility located in Charleston,
South Carolina. In 2002, a $02million payment was made based on the level of
manufacturing revenues at this facility. No payment was made in 2003.
Additional contingent payments of up to $48million plus additional royalties
may become due in increments through June30, 2006 based on the level of
manufacturing revenues during this period. These contingent payment obligations
have not yet been recorded as a liability on Companys consolidated balance sheets. Set forth in the table below are the details of the purchase price allocations
for each of the Companys major product line acquisitions since the beginning
of 2001. The table lists the assets acquired, the value allocated to each
asset, how the value was determined, and the estimated useful life assigned to
each asset. In these acquisitions, the only tangible assets acquired were
inventory and marketing/promotional materials, which were valued based on
internal analyses and data provided by the sellers. Inventory obtained at time
of acquisition was valued at the estimated selling price less the cost of
disposal and a reasonable selling profit. Marketing/promotional materials
received were generally outdated and in limited quantities; therefore no
material value was assigned in the purchase price allocations. The Company
engaged third-party valuation consultants to assist the Company with its
purchase price allocations, including identification of intangible assets
recommendations of fair value of intangible assets, and determination of
expected lives of those assets. Intangible assets that arose from contractual
or legal rights and other intangible assets that were separable, as discussed
in SFAS 141, were identified. Among the assets that were considered for
recognition were trademarks, Internet domain names, non-competition agreements,
customer lists, backlogs, customer contracts and non-contractual relationships,
licensing and royalty agreements, supply contracts, employment contracts,
patented and unpatented technology, and trade secrets. The third-party valuation consultants reviewed pertinent facts and recommended
for each asset the appropriate generally accepted valuation approach and
methodology from among the cost, market, and income approaches. Where
possible, a valuation derived using an alternative valuation approach or
methodology was presented and used by management to evaluate the reasonableness
of the recommended fair value. 106

In March2002, the Company entered into a $175million senior secured credit
facility consisting of a $750million five-year revolving credit facility and
a $100million five-year term loan facility. The term loan facility amortized
over the full five-year term. The senior facilities were subsequently reduced
due to early repayments made under the term loan facility. In December2003,
the remaining term loan facility of $40million was repaid and a new term loan
facility was entered into. As part of this transaction, the Company recorded a
$15million loss for the early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off
of financing fees associated with the original term loan. The December2003
term loan was a $160million facility which amortized over a six-year term.
The net proceeds from this facility were used to fund the acquisition of the
New Pain Products, as described in Note 2. In December2003, the revolving
credit facility was amended and increased to $85million, which was
subsequently increased to $100million in January2004. At December31, 2003,
the Company had unused availability under the revolving credit facility of
$770million. The availability of borrowings under the revolving credit
facility was not limited by a borrowing base. The term loan and revolving
credit facilities provide for variable interest rates based on LIBOR or an
alternate base rate, at the Companys option. On December31, 2003, 30-day
LIBOR was 112%. Such facilities are guaranteed by all domestic subsidiaries
and secured by a security interest on substantially all domestic assets, all of
the stock of domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the stock of material foreign
subsidiaries. These senior credit 110 facilities require the payment of certain commitment fees based on the unused
portion of the revolving credit facility and may be prepaid at any time without
a premium. Also in March2002, the Company issued $175million of senior subordinated
notes due April1, 2010. The proceeds from the issuance of these notes were
$1739million, which was net of the original issue discount. This discount
will be charged to interest expense over the term of the notes. These notes
have a fixed interest rate of 11% per annum and are guaranteed on a
subordinated basis by all existing domestic subsidiaries and all future
domestic subsidiaries that are owned 80% or more by the Company. The notes are
not secured. Prior to the third anniversary of the date of issuance of the
notes, up to 35% of the notes are redeemable with the proceeds of qualified
sales of equity at 111% of par value. On or after the fourth anniversary of
the date of issuance of the notes, all or any portion of the notes are
redeemable at declining premiums to par value, beginning at 1055%. Concurrent with the issuance of the senior subordinated notes, the Company
entered into an interest rate hedging agreement to effectively convert
interest expense on a portion of the senior subordinated notes for the term of
the notes from an 11% fixed annual rate to a floating annual rate equal to
6-month LIBOR plus a base rate. On February27, 2003, and again on June23,
2003, the Company sold the then outstanding interest rate hedging agreement for
$23million and $37million, respectively, and replaced it with a similar
interest rate hedging agreement. The amounts received, less the interest
benefits earned through the dates of sale, have been recorded as premiums to
the carrying amount of the notes and are being amortized into interest income
over their remaining life. At December31, 2003, the Company had an interest
rate hedging agreement in place covering $150million of the notes, at a rate
of 6-month LIBOR plus 741%. On December31, 2003, 6-month LIBOR was 122 giving the Company an estimated all-in rate of 863%. The terms of the
interest rate hedging agreements, other than the base rate, were identical and
were perfectly matched with the terms of the related hedged instrument. On
February27, 2004, 6-month LIBOR was 117%. Under the terms of the senior secured credit facility and the senior
subordinated notes, the Company is required to comply with various covenants
including, but not limited to, those pertaining to maintenance of certain
financial ratios and incurring additional indebtedness. The Company was not in
compliance with the covenants at December31, 2003, see Note 1 for further
discussion. Scheduled maturities of long-term debt as of December31, 2003, were as follows

As a result of aaiPharmas failure to timely file the Companys annual report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2003, among other matters,
aaiPharma was in default of these term loan and revolving credit facilities.
On April23, 2004, aaiPharma refinanced these facilities with a portion of the
proceeds from the M.V.I. sale and with $140million of senior credit facilities
with a syndicate of lenders, Silver Point Finance LLC Silver Point as
collateral agent, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. The
Companys 111 new senior credit facilities consist of a two-year, $125million senior secured
term loan facility which was fully drawn at closing and a two-year, $15
million senior secured revolving credit facility, of which the entire amount
was available for borrowing at closing. The outstanding loans under the
Companys new senior credit facilities are payable in full on the two-year
anniversary date of the closing of the facilities. The Companys
new senior credit facilities are secured by a security interest on
substantially all domestic assets, all of the stock of domestic
subsidiaries and 65% of the stock of material foreign subsidiaries. Subject to exceptions set
forth in the definitive documentation, loans under the Companys new senior
credit facilities are also required to be prepaid with a negotiated percentage
of   
excess cash flow, as defined     
non-ordinary course assets sales     
net proceeds from the sale of subordinated indebtedness     
net proceeds from the issuance of equity issuances; and     
extraordinary receipts, as defined. Optional reductions in revolving credit commitments and optional prepayments of
term loans are subject to a prepayment fee equal to 3% for the first 9months
of the term of the facilities, 15% for the subsequent 9months of such term,
and 075% for the next 3months of such term with no prepayment penalty
payable for the last 3months of the term. Outstanding loans under the
facilities bear interest at a rate per annum equal to a defined LIBOR rate
with a floor of 2%, plus 625%, or a defined reference rate with a floor of
4%, plus 525%, in each case payable monthly in arrears. An additional 1% per
annum unused line fee is payable on unused revolving credit commitments,
payable quarterly in arrears. The proceeds of the loans were used, together with the net cash proceeds from
the sale of the M.V.I. and Aquasol product lines, to ifund payment of
termination obligations with respect to the Companys interest rate hedging
agreement discussed below, iirefinance the Companys then-existing senior
credit facilities, iiifund the April2004 interest payment due on the
Companys 11% senior subordinated notes due 2010, ivprovide for ongoing
working capital and general corporate needs, and vpay for fees, costs and
expenses in connection with the new senior credit facilities and other
corporate transactions. The Companys new senior credit facilities include customary representations
and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including
limitations on liens, indebtedness, fundamental transactions, dispositions of
assets, changes in the nature of the Companys business, investments,
acquisitions, capital and operating leases, capital expenditures, dividends,
redemptions or other acquisitions of capital stock, redemptions or prepayments
of other debt, transactions with affiliates, issuances of capital stock,
modifications of indebtedness, organizational documents and other agreements,
and retention of excess cash. The facilities also provided for financial
covenants, including a minimum fixed charge ratio, a maximum total debt to
trailing twelve-month EBITDA ratio, and a covenant requiring a certain level of
cash or revolver availability. The Companys new senior credit facilities
include a covenant requiring the Company to file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission by September30, 2004 the Companys annual report on Form
10-K for the year ended December31, 2003 and other periodic reports then
required to be filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Events of
default under the facilities include, among others, nonpayment of principal,
interest or fees, violations of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and
warranties, a cross-default to the Companys 11% senior subordinated notes due
2010 and other material indebtedness, bankruptcy events, and a change in
control. On March31, 2004, the lenders under the Companys then-existing credit
agreement, which was then in default as described above, exercised their right
to block the Company from making the interest payment due 112 on April1, 2004 to holders of the Companys senior subordinated notes.
Accordingly, aaiPharma did not make that interest payment on April1, 2004. In
addition, the Companys failure to timely file the Companys annual report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2003 constituted a default under the
indenture governing the senior subordinated notes. On April20, 2004, aaiPharma completed a solicitation seeking the consent from
holders of the Companys senior subordinated notes to approve a refinancing or
replacement of the Companys then-existing credit facilities with the Companys
new senior credit facilities and certain amendments to, and waivers under, the
indenture governing the senior subordinated notes to, among other things   
grant a lien to secure the Companys obligations under the
senior subordinated notes, which lien is junior to the liens securing
the Companys new senior credit facilities but covers the same
collateral     
increase the interest rate of the senior subordinated from 11%
per annum to 115% per annum effective April1, 2004     
suspend the Companys obligation under the indenture to file
periodic reports with the SEC until the earlier of the date that the
Companys annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31,
2003 is filed with the SEC or September30, 2004, and suspend
the Companys obligation to furnish annual written statements
of the Companys accountants until the fifth day after the
earlier of the date that the Companys annual report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December31, 2003 is filed with the SEC and
September30, 2004     
further limit the Companys ability to grant liens to secure
certain obligations unless the liens are subordinate to the liens
securing the senior subordinated notes or are otherwise permitted
under the indenture; and     
limit the Companys ability to incur up to $10million of
indebtedness, and to grant liens to secure that amount of
indebtedness, not otherwise specifically permitted by the indenture,
until the Companys annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December31, 2003 is filed with the SEC or unless the indebtedness is
incurred to fund an interest payment with respect to the senior
subordinated notes. Following the completion of a consent solicitation, aaiPharma entered into a
supplemental indenture to affect these amendments and waivers and made the
interest payments that had been due on April1, 2004, together with default
interest. The
Company made interest payments on the senior subordinated notes of
$96million in October2003 and $97million in April2004. The April2004 interest payment
was offset by approximately $17million received under the Companys interest
rate hedging agreement, described above. As a condition to establishing the Companys new senior credit facilities,
aaiPharma terminated the interest rate hedging agreement in April2004. The
Companys termination obligations under the interest rate hedging agreement
were approximately $94million, which amount was paid upon termination of that
agreement. 7. Stockholders Equity The authorized capital stock of the Company at December31, 2003 and 2002 was
100million shares of voting common stock, $0001 par value per share, and 5
million shares of preferred stock, $0001 par value per share. The preferred
stock is issuable in one or more series by the Companys Board of Directors
without further stockholder approval. No preferred stock was outstanding at
December31, 2003 or 2002. The Company has reserved 10million shares of
common stock for issuance under the stock option plans at December31, 2003. 113 Stock Option and Award Plans The Company has five stock option plans: the 2000 Stock Option Plan for
Non-Employee Directors the 2000 Plan, the 1997 Stock Option Plan the 1997
Plan, the 1996 Stock Option Plan the 1996 Plan, the 1995 Stock Option
Plan the 1995 Plan and the 1996 Incentive and Non-Qualified Stock Option
Plan the MTRA Plan. Under the 1995 Plan, the Board of Directors initially
could grant options to purchase up to 363,807 shares of common stock. However,
the Company has no obligation to issue the shares upon exercise of such options
until it has purchased an equal number of shares from certain existing
stockholders. Under the 2000 Plan, the 1997 Plan and the 1996 Plan, the Board
of Directors initially could grant options to purchase up to 615,000, 3,966,000
and 743,441, respectively, of newly issued shares of common stock. The Board of
Directors reserved 776,250 shares to cover the exercise of the options under
the MTRA Plan. The plans require that the exercise price of options cannot be
less than either 100% 2000 Plan, 1997 Plan and MTRA Plan or 75% 1996 and
1995 Plans of the estimated fair market value of the Companys shares of
common stock on the date of grant. As of December31, 2003, the Company had
granted 1,160,251 options to certain executives that cliff vest after seven
years. These options, however, have an accelerated vesting provision where
granted options will vest in the following proportions if the Companys share
closing price equals or exceed the following share price for seven consecutive
days: 25%, $2267; 50%, $3400; 75%, $4533; and 100%, $5567. The combined activity from all plans is presented in the following table

At December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, exercisable options representing 28
million, 18million and 14million shares, respectively, were outstanding. 8. Related Party Transactions Endeavor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In 1994, aaiPharma organized Endeavor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Endeavor with
several investors to fund the development of hormone pharmaceutical products,
initially focusing on several generic hormone products already under
development by the Company. The Company also agreed to permit Endeavor, under
certain circumstances, the first right to purchase additional proprietary
hormone pharmaceutical products developed by aaiPharma. aaiPharma obtained a
47% equity interest in Endeavor through the contribution of its accumulated
product research and development and technical know-how. The other investors
contributed cash in exchange for their interests which, for all investors, was
in the form of convertible preferred stock. Based on subsequent investments by
other investors, the Companys interest, assuming conversion, had been reduced
to approximately 10% of the fully diluted common equity of Endeavor. Subsequent
to the reduction in ownership percentage and its reduced influence over the
Endeavor operations, the Company ceased accounting for this as an equity method
investment and began to account for it under the cost method. Endeavor has
accumulated significant losses since inception and this investment had been
recorded at zero value since 1995. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Endeavor sold
substantially all of its assets to a third party. As part of this transaction,
the Company recorded a pretax gain of $18million for the sale of its
investment in Endeavor. This gain is included in other income on the
consolidated statements of operations. As of December31, 2003, the Company no
longer had any investment in Endeavor. The Company had net sales to Endeavor of approximately $06million, $11
million and $02million for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. At December31, 2003, the Company had no related accounts
receivable and at December31, 2002, the Company had $03million in related
accounts receivable. 115 Aesgen, Inc. Aesgen, Inc. Aesgen was formally organized with an affiliate of the Mayo
Clinic and MOVA Pharmaceutical Corporation and funded in 1995 through the
issuance of approximately $11million of nonconvertible, nonvoting, mandatorily
redeemable, preferred stock. The Company made a cash investment of $16million
in such preferred stock, which is carried at cost, and is included in other
noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets. In January
2001, the terms of the preferred stock owned by the Company were amended to
make that class of stock convertible into Aesgen common stock. In October2001, the Company entered into a Service Agreement and a
Subscription Agreement with Aesgen, whereby the Company has agreed to perform
certain clinical work for Aesgen and to receive Aesgen preferred stock in lieu
of cash for the services performed. The Company has subscribed to $11million
of preferred stock, and will receive up to 10,829 shares of such stock, in lieu
of cash for the related shares. Through December31, 2003, the Company has
performed services under the agreement of $580,000. At December31, 2003, the
Company held 10% of Aesgens fully diluted common
stock. The Company does
not anticipate performing any additional services for Aesgen under this
agreement. In February2002, the Company purchased a proprietary product from Aesgen for
payments of $10million in cash and additional contingent milestone payments
of up to $15million. In 2003, the prerequisite for payment of an additional
$500,000 of such contingent milestones occurred and such payment was made to
Aesgen, while the prerequisites for payment of the remaining $10million were
not met and no further payment of this amount is owed by the Company. Under
this agreement, the Company is obligated to pay royalty payments for the
eight-year period following the first commercial sale of the product. In 2003,
the Company expensed royalties related to this agreement of $06million. Of
this amount, none was payable at December31, 2003. In 1996, the Company sold to Aesgen marketing rights to a product under
development by the Company. Under the agreement, Aesgen paid a license fee and
would have paid additional royalties upon marketing the product. aaiPharma had
the right, under its development agreement with Aesgen, to provide certain
product development and support services to Aesgen with respect to some generic
drugs currently being developed by Aesgen, provided that aaiPharmas fees for
such services were comparable to those of a competitor. In addition, under such
development agreement, the Company had agreed not to develop, for its own
account or any other person, a formulation of any of the generic products
currently under development for Aesgen and any additional drugs that aaiPharma
agrees to develop in the future for Aesgen. aaiPharma recognized net revenues of zero, $494,000 and $86,000 from Aesgen for
the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively. The Company had
no related accounts receivable from Aesgen or work-in-progress at December31,
2003 or 2002. Cetan Technologies, Inc. The Company used Cetan Technologies, Inc. Cetan, to provide scanning and
indexing services required as part of aaiPharmas regulatory compliance and
record retention policies. Cetans principal stockholders include Dr.
Frederick Sancilio and Mr.James Waters, both directors of aaiPharma. The
Company engaged Cetan to perform these services since 1996 and compensated
Cetan pursuant to written agreements for the services. Cetan also provided
computer validation services to aaiPharma, which were required for compliance
with regulatory requirements. Total payments for scanning and validation
services provided to aaiPharma by Cetan were zero, $7,000 and $4,000 for the
years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 116 9. Income Taxes The following table presents the components for the benefit from provision

117 Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
Deferred taxes are included in prepaid and other current assets, other accrued
liabilities and other long-term liabilities. The following table presents the

Valuation allowances have been provided for certain assets resulting from
accumulated net operating losses from foreign entities and other deferred tax
assets because FAS 109 requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a
valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the
deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December31, 2003, the Company
had no federal net operating losses and $5million of state net operating loss
carryforwards, expiring in 2005. Undistributed earnings of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries at December
31, 2003, amounted to $29million. No provision for deferred U.S. income
taxes has been made for these subsidiaries because aaiPharma intends to
permanently reinvest such earnings in those foreign operations. If such
earnings were not permanently reinvested, a deferred tax liability would have
been required. 10. Employee Benefit Plan The Company provides retirement benefits for all domestic aaiPharma employees
with one year of service through a defined contribution plan qualified under
section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Participants
may elect to contribute a portion of their annual compensation, subject to
limitations. The Company makes matching contributions in aaiPharma stock equal
to 50% of a participants contribution up to a certain amount. Additionally,
the Company may make profit-sharing contributions at the discretion of the
Board of Directors. The Company expensed $11million, $10million and $08
million for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, for
this benefit plan, all related to the matching contributions. 118 11. Commitments and Contingencies The Company leases land, buildings and equipment under renewable lease
agreements classified as operating leases. Rent expense under these agreements
for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $71million, $70
million and $69million, respectively. As of December31, 2003, future
minimum rentals due under non-cancelable operating lease agreements with
initial terms of one year or more were: $77million2004; $66million2005 48million2006; $46million2007; $45million2008 and $73
millionthereafter. As of December31, 2003, future minimum rentals due under
non-cancelable capital lease agreements with initial terms of one year or more
were: $03million2004; $02million2005; $02million2006; and
zerothereafter. In 2003, the Company entered a three-year services agreement with Athlon
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Athlon to provide sales support in designated
territories throughout the United States for the Darvocet A500 product. As of
December31, 2003, future minimum payments due under this agreement were: $144
million2004; $144million2005; $108million2006; and zerothereafter.
The Company has commenced litigation against Athlon with respect to this
agreement, and terminated this agreement, as described below. The Company also
entered into a multi-year supply agreement for Darvocet A500 with a separate
third party. As of December31, 2003, the minimum guaranteed purchase
requirement remaining under this agreement was $129million. The Company has
amended this agreement to allow additional Company products to be manufactured
under this supply agreement and for these products to be counted against the
minimum purchase obligation, although the Company and this party have not yet
agreed on the terms for manufacturing these additional products, including
price. In 1995, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Dr.Frederick D.
Sancilio, which was most recently amended in 2003. The employment agreement
renews automatically for successive two-year periods unless either party
notifies the other party of an intention not to extend the term. Dr.Sancilio
currently serves as aaiPharmas Executive Chairman of the Board, Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Scientific Officer. The Board of Directors set Dr.
Sancilios annual salary at $422,000 effective January1, 2003, which has not
yet been adjusted to reflect his resumption of responsibilities as Chief
Executive Officer in March2004. Pursuant to the employment agreement, Dr.
Sancilio receives a bonus when aaiPharma receives certain regulatory approvals.
This bonus is in the amount of $250,000 for each new drug application and
$50,000 for each supplemental new drug application or abbreviated new drug
application. Dr.Sancilio was awarded a bonus of $100,000 in March2003 upon
regulatory approval and commercialization of two products. The employment
agreement permits the Company to terminate Dr.Sancilios employment at any
time, with or without cause. However, if the Company terminates Dr.Sancilios
employment without cause or if Dr.Sancilio terminates his employment within 90
days after a constructive discharge as defined in the agreement, Dr.
Sancilio would be entitled to receive payments aggregating three times his then
current annual salary. These payments would be made in monthly installments
over two years, during which time Dr.Sancilio would continue to receive his
medical and life insurance benefits. The Company is party to lawsuits and administrative proceedings incidental to
the normal course of its business. The Company is also party to, or named as a
defendant in, purported class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal
securities and ERISA laws. On August7, 2003 the Company received a letter from the staff of the
Enforcement Division of the SEC the Enforcement Division requesting
voluntary production of certain documents. The Company responded to this
letter on August21, 2003 and supplemented its response on August29, 2003. Independent of the August7, 2003 inquiry letter, on September26, 2003,
certain members of the Companys board and management voluntarily met with, and
provided documents to, the staff of the Enforcement Division. As a follow-up
to this September26, 2003 meeting and as part of the inquiry initiated on
August7, 2003, on October8, 2003, the Company received a further request from
staff of the Enforcement Division for voluntary production of certain
documents, to which the Company responded on October30, 2003. On January14, 2004 and April26, 2004, the Company received letters from the
SECs Division of Corporate Finance commenting on, asking questions about, and
seeking additional disclosure with respect to certain of our periodic reports.
The Company has responded to these letters. 119 In April2004, in connection with an investigation conducted by the United
States Attorneys Office for the Western District of North Carolina the U.S.
Attorneys Office, the Company received five federal grand jury subpoenas for
document production and potential testimony related to, among other things,
certain transactions regarding its 2002 and 2003 financial information, the
terms, conditions of employment and compensation arrangements of certain of its
senior management personnel, compensation and incentive arrangements for
employees responsible for the sale of its Brethine, Darvocet, calcitriol,
azathioprine and Darvon Compound products, quantities of the foregoing products
in distribution channels, financial benefits with respect to specified
corporate transactions to its senior management and others, certain loans
obtained by it, extensions of credit, if any, by it to officers or directors,
accounting for sales and returns of its foregoing products, its analysts
conference calls on financial results, internal and external investigations of
pharmaceutical product sales activities, and related matters. The Company also
been advised that the SEC has initiated an inquiry into at least the same issues
investigated by the Special Committee. The U.S. Attorneys Office has advised
that the Company may also receive a subpoena from the SEC. The Company and the Special Committee have agreed to cooperate fully with the
government investigations, and the Special Committee has agreed to share all
results of its investigation with the SEC and the U.S. Attorneys Office. To
that end, two meetings of outside counsel of the Company with attorneys for the
U.S. Attorneys Office and the SEC have taken place and numerous documents as
requested by these government agencies have been voluntarily
produced. We are attempting to schedule a third
meeting with the U.S. Attorneys Office and the SEC in July in order to provide additional information related to the Special
Committees investigation to these government agencies. The Company and the
Special Committee intend to facilitate any interviews of employees or officers
of the Company that may be requested by these government agencies. The Department of Justice, SEC and other government agencies that are
investigating or might commence an investigation of the Company could impose,
based on a claim of fraud, material misstatements, violation of false claims
law or otherwise, civil and/or criminal sanctions, including fines, penalties,
and/or administrative remedies. If any government sanctions are imposed, which
the Company cannot predict or reasonably estimate at this time, the Companys
business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be
materially adversely affected. These matters have resulted, and are expected to
continue to result, in a significant diversion of managements attention and
resources and in significant professional fees. On January2, 2004, aaiPharma received separate letters from the Kentucky
Office of Attorney General and the Florida Office of Attorney General advising
that each was currently investigating allegations regarding the Companys
pricing practices related to the Companys average manufacturer price and best
price calculations that are used by the government to set Medicaid
reimbursement rates. Neither letter requested that aaiPharma provide any
information, and each letter merely requested that aaiPharma retain all
documents with respect to these calculations pursuant to a newly adopted
federal regulation that would have permitted the destruction of these documents
three years after the applicable prices were reported, except to the extent
aaiPharma was aware of an ongoing investigation. It is the Companys
understanding that many other pharmaceutical companies received similar letters
at that time from attorneys general in a number of states and that such letters
may have been in response to the new federal regulation that would have
otherwise allowed the destruction of documents reflecting these pricing
calculations. A number of attorneys general, including the Florida and Kentucky
attorneys general, petitioned the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services
to withdraw the new regulation. aaiPharma is not aware of any further
developments in these investigations. The Company and certain of its officers have been named as defendants in
purported shareholder class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal
securities laws. These lawsuits were filed beginning in February2004 120 and are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North
Carolina. These lawsuits assert claims under Sections 10b and 20a of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule10b-5 thereunder on behalf of a class
of purchasers of the Companys common stock during the period from January31, 2002
through and including March1, 2004 the ClassPeriod. The complaints
allege generally that the defendants knowingly or recklessly made false or
misleading statements during the ClassPeriod concerning the Companys
financial condition and that the Companys financial statements did not present
its true financial condition and were not prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. The complaints seek certification as a class
action, unspecified compensatory damages, attorneys fees and costs, and other
relief. By order dated April16, 2004, the district court consolidated the
securities lawsuits into one consolidated action. The Company expects that the
plaintiffs will file a consolidated, amended complaint later in 2004, to which
the Company will respond in lieu of responding to the individual complaints. In addition, the Company, one of its former officers, certain of its employees
and others have been named in a purported class action brought by an aaiPharma
retirement plan participant and beneficiary asserting claims under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA on behalf of a
class of all persons who are or were participants or beneficiaries of the
aaiPharma Inc. Retirement and Savings Plan the Plan during the period from
April24, 2002 to March31, 2004. The complaint alleges generally that the
defendants breached fiduciary duties owed under ERISA with respect to the
investment of Plan assets in aaiPharma stock by misleading participants and
beneficiaries of the Plan regarding the Companys earnings, prospects, and business
condition. The complaint seeks certification as a class action, unspecified
compensatory damages, attorneys fees and costs, and other relief. These securities and ERISA lawsuits are at an early stage. By, and subject to,
the terms of our bylaws, the Company has certain obligations to indemnify the officers
of the Company and others who have been named as defendants in these lawsuits.
The Company has purchased directors and officers liability insurance DO insurance
that may provide coverage for some or all of these lawsuits and governmental
investigations. There is a risk, however, that some or all of the claims or
expenses will not be covered by such policies; or that, even if covered, the Companys
ultimate liability will exceed the available insurance. Although the
Company intends to
vigorously pursue all defenses available in these lawsuits, an adverse
determination in these lawsuits or an inability to obtain payment
under the Companys DO
insurance policies for litigation and indemnification costs and any damages
ultimately borne by the Company as a result of these lawsuits and investigations could
have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows. On April15, 2004, the Company filed a lawsuit against Athlon seeking a
declaratory judgment that the Company was entitled to terminate the Service
Agreement the Athlon Service Agreement dated July16, 2003, as amended,
between aaiPharma and Athlon as well as damages and injunctive relief for
material breaches of the Athlon Service Agreement by Athlon. The Athlon
Service Agreement incorporated the terms and conditions pursuant to which
representatives of Athlon would promote the sale of our Darvocet A500 product
to physicians. The Company initially paid Athlon $3,350,000 to build its sales
force to promote the sale of our Darvocet A500, and the terms of the Athlon
Service Agreement would require the Company to pay Athlon an additional
$1,200,000 each month for such services for the contract period of 36months,
commencing in October2003, subject to Athlons compliance with certain
representations, warranties and covenants, some of which are described below. The lawsuit asserts that Athlon has materially breached the Athlon Service
Agreement in several ways, including failure to: iprovide the required
number of sales representatives during our launch of Darvocet 121 A500 commencing in October2003, iiuse its best efforts to promote Darvocet
A500 at the targeted levels of first and second pharmaceutical details to
physicians, iiiperform the services to the best of its ability, as
contractually required; and ivrequire its sales representatives to perform
the contracted services, as required, in a professional manner consistent with
industry standards and in conformance with that level of care and skill
ordinarily exercised by professional contract sales organizations in similar
circumstances. The lawsuit also asserts that Athlon breached its representation
and warranty that it would perform, and would require its sales representatives
to perform, the contracted services in substantially the same manner that it
would promote Athlons own products. Athlon has asserted several counterclaims, including breach of an implied
covenant of good faith in fair dealing and anticipatory breach of the contract.
The Company has filed a reply denying these allegations. On June4, 2004, the Company sent a notice of termination of the Athlon Service
Agreement to Athlon. The Company also informed Athlon of its intent to amend
the lawsuit to assert the defense of fraud in the inducement in the formation
of the agreement on the part of Athlon and other claims. The
Company intends to prosecute its claims, and defend against the counterclaims made by
Athlon in connection with the referenced lawsuit or related litigation, to the
full extent permitted by law. The Company is a party to a number of legal actions with generic drug
companies. The Company is involved in four lawsuits centered on its
omeprazole-related patents, including one lawsuit brought by the Company
against an alleged infringer of the Companys patents and three lawsuits which
were brought by third parties against the Company and are currently essentially
inactive. Omeprazole is the active ingredient found in Prilosec, a drug sold by
AstraZeneca. Two omeprazole-related cases have been filed against the company by Dr.Reddys
Laboratories Ltd. and Dr.Reddys Laboratories, Inc. in the U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New York in July2001 and November2001. The
plaintiffs in these cases have challenged the validity of five
patents that the Company has obtained relating to omeprazole and are seeking a declaratory judgment
that their generic form of Prilosec does not infringe these patents.
Additionally, they have alleged misappropriation of trade secrets, tortious
interference, unfair competition and violations of the North Carolina Unfair
Trade Practice Act. The third case involving the Companys omeprazole patents was brought in August
2001 by Andrx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York. Andrx has challenged the validity of three of the
Companys omeprazole patents and has also sought a declaratory judgment that
its generic omeprazole product does not infringe these patents. Furthermore,
Andrx claims violations of federal and state antitrust laws with respect to the
licensing of these omeprazole patents and has sought injunctive relief and
unspecified treble damages. The fourth case involving the omeprazole patents was brought in December2002,
and subsequently amended, by the Company against Kremers Urban Development Co.,
Schwarz Pharma Inc. and Schwarz Pharma AG collectively, KUDCO in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York. KUDCO has a generic
omeprazole product with final FDA marketing approval, was found not to infringe
the AstraZeneca patents in the separate AstraZeneca patent litigation, and is
currently selling its generic substitute for Prilosec in the U.S. marketplace.
KUDCO has filed its answer to the complaint, denying the Companys claims,
asserting various affirmative defenses to the claims, and asserting
counterclaims of patent invalidity, product 122 non-infringement and antitrust violations under federal and state antitrust
laws. KUDCO is also contesting the personal jurisdiction of the court over all
of the defendants in this lawsuit other than Kremers Urban Development Co. and
Schwarz Pharma Inc. Motions on the jurisdictional issues are pending before
the court. The Company has denied the substantive allegations made by KUDCO in its
counterclaims. The Company has previously indicated to KUDCO a willingness to
grant a license under its omeprazole patents for an appropriate royalty. In
the absence of a license, the Company intends to vigorously prosecute the case,
defend its patent rights and defend against the foregoing defenses and
counterclaims asserted by KUDCO. The Company cannot predict the outcomes of these lawsuits. Future adverse
findings in the above described lawsuits could have a material adverse effect
on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 12. Financial Information by Business Segment and Geographic Area The Company operates in three business segments consisting of a product sales
business, primarily comprised of the pharmaceuticals division, a product
development business, primarily the research and development business unit, and
a development services business, primarily the AAI Development Services
business unit. The product sales business provides for the sales of the
Companys pharmaceutical product lines and for the commercial manufacturing of
small quantity products outsourced by other pharmaceutical companies. In the
product development segment, the Company internally develops drugs and
technologies for future sales by the product sales business or with the
objective of licensing marketing rights to third parties in exchange for
license fees and royalties. The core services provided by the development
services business on a fee-for-service basis to pharmaceutical and
biotechnology industries worldwide include comprehensive formulation, testing
and manufacturing expertise, in addition to the ability to take investigational
products into and through human clinical trials. The majority of the Companys
non-U.S. operations are located in Germany. Corporate income lossfrom operations includes general corporate overhead
costs and, in fiscal 2001, goodwill amortization, which are not directly
attributable to a business segment. Financial data by segment and geographic
region are as follows

134 Item4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders No matters were submitted to our stockholders during the fourth quarter of
2003. 28 PART II Item5. Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company has carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of its newly appointed Chief Executive Officer and interim Chief
Financial Officer, pursuant to Rule13a-15 promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2003,
the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Disclosure
controls and procedures are to be designed to ensure that material information
the Company must disclose in its reports filed or submitted under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
on a timely basis. As a result of that review, our Chief Executive Officer and
interim Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, the
Companys disclosure controls and procedures were not adequate. The internal control deficiencies related to, among other things, a lack of
adequate policies with respect to revenue recognition, and a lack of sufficient
control processes and procedures to effectively monitor and manage wholesaler
inventory levels, to ensure adequate contract-approval oversight, and to ensure
effective and timely communication among sales, marketing, finance and legal
staff regarding the terms and conditions of certain transactions, including new
product launches. Also, with respect to the sales of pharmaceutical products,
the Companys finance and accounting personnel lacked adequate training on the
application of revenue recognition principles and the establishment of product
return reserves. In addition, in April2004, in connection with their audit of the Companys
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December31, 2003, the
Companys independent auditors identified and communicated to the Company and
the Audit Committee two material weaknesses as defined under standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants relating
to the Companys accounting and public financial reporting of significant
matters and to its initial recording and management review and oversight of
certain accounting matters. The material weaknesses were with respect to the
calculation and procedures for the analysis of revenue reserves for product
sales and lack of procedures for timely communications from the Legal
Department and operating divisions to the Finance Department impairing the
ability to properly evaluate the accounting treatment for certain transactions
the Company had entered into and assess the impact of such transactions in a
timely manner. In addition, at that time, the Companys independent auditors
identified and communicated to the Company and the Audit Committee a
reportable condition as defined under standards established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants relating to the Companys internal
controls over its financial reporting for investments. The reportable
condition identified the Companys failure to perform a formal review of its
investments and timely to record patents or trademarks or to timely analyze
the patents and trademarks for usefulness and possible impairment. In view of the fact that the financial information presented in this annual
report was prepared 135 in the absence of adequate internal controls over financial reporting, the
Company devoted a significant amount of time and resources to the analysis of
the financial information and documentation underlying the financial statements
contained in this annual report, including the related interim financial
statements, resulting in the restatement of certain interim financial
statements. In particular, the Company reviewed significant product sales
transactions to confirm the terms of the transaction and our accounting for the
transaction, including whether all criteria for the recognition of revenue had
been satisfied and whether we had properly estimated allowances for returns and
other customer credits. In addition, the Company reviewed in detail each of
the matters identified by the Special Committee and its independent counsel and
independent forensic accountants. The investigation of the Special Committee
is discussed in Item7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations Special Committee Investigation. In light of the foregoing, the Company has taken the following actions, in
addition to those described above, after the end of the fiscal year covered by
this report to address the deficiencies as described above   
reassigned all financial controllers from operating units
into the Finance Department reporting to the Companys Controller
and Chief Accounting Officer who reports directly to the Chief
Financial Officer     
commenced a company-wide education effort regarding our Code
of Conduct and contract-approval policies     
implemented a more vigorous contract-approval process     
implemented formal revenue recognition protocols and training programs; and     
contracted with a third-party consulting group, FTI
Consulting, to provide transitional management services in the area
of operations and finance. In addition, since December31, 2003, the Companys then Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer have left the
Company. In March of 2004, Dr.Sancilio, the Companys Executive Chairman and
Chief Scientific Officer, was appointed Chief Executive Officer, and Gregory F.
Rayburn, a consultant with FTI Consulting, was appointed Interim Chief
Operating Officer. In April2004, Timothy R. Wright was appointed President of
the Companys Pharmaceuticals Products Division. Gina Gutzeit, another
consultant with FTI Consulting, was appointed as interim Chief Financial
Officer in May2004. The Company is fully committed to implementing controls identified by the
Companys independent auditors and the Special Committee. The Companys
efforts to strengthen its financial and internal controls continue, and the
Company expects to complete remediation of 136 the material weaknesses and reportable condition identified by its independent
auditors by the end of 2004. PART III
