Since the acquisition of CILCORP and CILCO on January 31, 2003, we have
been conducting a review of their financial statements. As a result of this
ongoing review,  revenue,  operating income,  net income from continuing
operations, and total assets for 2002 and 2001 may change from the disclosure
made on Page 64 of the 2002 Annual Report in Note 18 - Subsequent Event to our
Consolidated Financial Statements. CILCORP and AmerenCILCO intend to file a Form
12b-25 with the SEC on April 1, 2003 and file their respective Annual Reports on
Form 10-K within 15 calendar days of March 31, 2003. You should refer to these
filings, for any changes to revenue, operating income, net income from
continuing operations, and total assets, which are expected to be noncash, and
will have no impact on the financial statements of Ameren or the assumptions
upon which the CILCORP acquisition was based. Item 1  Business
