Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Eclipsys
Corporation: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Eclipsys Corporation as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing
under Item9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation in 2006. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Atlanta, Georgia February 28, 2008

addition to providing records maintenance and assessment of the profitability of specific medical procedures and personnel.Clinical content, which is integrated with our software, providesevidence-based practice guidelines for use by
physicians, nurses and other clinicians. 2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of
Presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Eclipsys and our wholly owned subsidiaries. All material inter-company
transactions and balances between the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. Eclipsys manages its business as one reportable segment. Certain amounts in the prior period consolidated financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with current year presentation. Segment Information The Company follows SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS 131 requires that a company report financial and descriptive information about its reportable
operating segments. Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. The Companys chief operating decision maker currently evaluates the Companys operations from a number of different operational perspectives including but not limited to a client by client basis. The Company derives all
significant revenues from a single reportable operating segment of business, healthcare information technology. Accordingly, the Company does not report more than one segment; nevertheless, management evaluates, at least annually, whether the
Company continues to have one single reportable segment. Use of Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates and assumptions used in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are based upon managements
evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts, revenues recognized, the
amounts recorded for capitalized software development costs and related useful lives, stock-based compensation and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Restricted Cash The restricted cash balance was $20 million as of December31, 2007 and represents collateral to secure a letter of credit for our Atlanta facility. The cash
collateral is restricted by the terms of the credit agreement and is included in other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December31, 2007. 
44  Marketable Securities The Company accounts for marketable securities in accordance with SFAS115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The Company determines the appropriate classification of all marketable
securities as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading at the time of purchase, and re-evaluates such classification as of each balance sheet date. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, all of the Companys investments in marketable
securities were classified as available-for-sale, and as a result, were reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income lossin stockholders equity. The Company
uses the specific identification method to determine the cost basis in computing realized gains and losses on the sale of its available-for-sale securities. Accounts Receivable and Unbilled Receivables The timing of revenue recognition and contractual billing terms under certain multiple element
arrangements may not precisely coincide, resulting in the recording of unbilled accounts receivable or deferred revenue. Client payments are due under these arrangements in varying amounts primarily upon the achievement of certain contractual
milestones throughout the implementation periods, which generally range from 12 to 24 months.The current portion of unbilled accounts receivable is included in accounts receivable. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts In evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable, we assess a number of
factors, including a specific clients ability to meet its financial obligations to us, as well as general factors, such as the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience. Based on these assessments, we
record a reserve for specific account balances as well as a reserve based on our historical experience for bad debt to reduce the related receivables to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from clients. If circumstances related to specific
clients change, or economic conditions deteriorate such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant, our estimate of the recoverability of our accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels provided for in the
consolidated financial statements. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided for using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, which generally range from 2 to 7 years. Computer equipment is depreciated over 2 to 5
years. Office equipment is depreciated over2 to7 years. Purchased software for internal use is amortized over 3 years. Expenditures for our resource planning system are depreciated over 8 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
the shorter of the useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of the lease. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is
reflected in income. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance not considered to substantially lengthen the property and equipment lives are charged to expense as incurred. Capitalized Software Development Costs and Acquired Technology We capitalize a portion of our computer software
development costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility. These costs include salaries, benefits, consulting and other directly related costs incurred in connection with programming and testing software. Capitalization ceases
when the software is generally released for sale to clients. Capitalized software development costs were $209 million, $141 million, and $201 million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. These costs are
amortized over the greater of the ratio that current revenues are to total and anticipated future revenues for the applicable software or the straight-line method over three years. Amortization of capitalized software development costs, which is
included in costs of systems and services revenues, was $150 million, $175 million, and $143 million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Accumulated amortization of capitalized software development costs was
$238 million and $276 million as of December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Acquired technology is amortized over its estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Amortization of the acquired technology is included in the cost of
systems and services. Management monitors the net realizable value of development costs and acquired technology to ensure that the investment will be recovered through future revenues. Intangible Assets, including Goodwill Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a
straight line basis. Goodwill is reviewed annually in accordance with SFAS142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Testing would be done on a more frequent basis, if impairment indicators arise. The test for impairment is based
upon a number of factors, including operating results, business plans and projected future cash flows. No impairment has been identified or recorded in 2007, 2006 or 2005. 
45  Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, including separate and identifiable intangible assets, are reviewed for potential impairment at such time when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable. Any
impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the expected, undiscounted net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. If an asset is impaired, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. We did not record any
impairment of long-lived assets in 2007, 2006 or 2005. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and other current liabilities, approximate fair value due to
the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Revenue Recognition Revenues are derived from licensing of computer software; software and hardware maintenance; professional services including implementation, integration, training and consulting; remote hosting; outsourcing; network
services; and the sale of computer hardware. With the exception of hardware revenues, we classify our revenues in one caption systems and services in our statement of operations since the amount of license revenue related to traditional software
contracts is less than 10% of total revenues and the remaining revenue types included in this caption relate to bundled subscription arrangements and other services arrangements that have similar attribution patterns for revenue recognition.
We generally contract under multiple element arrangements, which include software license fees, hardware and services including implementation,
integration, training and software maintenance, for periods of 3 to 7 years. We evaluate revenue recognition on a contract-by-contract basis as the terms of each arrangement vary. The evaluation of our contractual arrangements often requires
judgments and estimates that affect the timing of revenue recognized in our statements of operations. Specifically, we may be required to make judgments about:  whether the fees associated with our software and services are fixed or determinable;  whether collection of our fees is considered probable;  whether professional services are essential to the functionality of the related software;  whether we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates in the application of the percentage-of-completion method; and  whether we have verifiable objective evidence of fair value for our software and services. We recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of SOP 97-2 Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP 98-9, SAB 104 Revenue
Recognition, and EITF 00-21 Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. SOP 97-2 and SAB 104 require among other matters, that there be a signed contract evidencing that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is
fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. Many of our contracts with our clients are multiple element arrangements which may provide for
multiple software modules including the rights to unspecified future versions and releases we may offer within the software suites the client purchases or rights to unspecified software versions that support different hardware or operating
platforms, and that do not qualify as exchange rights. We refer to these arrangements as subscription contracts.Additionally, we sometimes enter into multiple element arrangements that do not include these rights to unspecified future software
or platform protection rights.We refer to these arrangements as traditional software contracts.Finally, we offer much of our software and services on a stand-alone basis. Revenue under each of these arrangements is recognized as set
forth below: Subscription Contracts Our subscription
contracts typically include the following deliverables:  Software license fees;  Maintenance;  Professional services; and  Third party hardware or remote hosting services. 
46  Software license fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, commencing upon the delivery of the software
provided that 1there is evidence of an arrangement, 2the fee is fixed or determinable and 3collection of our fee is considered probable. The value of the software is determined using the residual method pursuant to
SOP98-9, Modification of SOP97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions. These contracts contain the rights to unspecified future software within the suite purchased and/or unspecified platform
transfer rights that do not qualify for exchange accounting. Accordingly, these arrangements are accounted for pursuant to paragraphs48 and 49 of SOP97-2. Under certain arrangements, we capitalize related direct costs consisting of third
party software costs and direct software implementation costs. These costs are amortized over the term of the arrangement. In the case of maintenance
revenues, vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value is based on substantive renewal prices, and the revenues are recognized ratably over the maintenance period. In the case of professional services revenues, VSOE is based on prices from stand-alone sale transactions, and the revenues are recognized as services are performed pursuant to paragraph65 and 66 of
SOP97-2. Third party hardware revenues are recognized upon delivery, pursuant to SAB104. For remote hosting services, where VSOE is based upon consistent pricing charged to clients based on volumes and performance requirements on a stand-alone basis and
substantive renewal terms, revenues are recognized ratably over the contract term as the services are performed. Our remote hosting arrangements generally require us to perform one-time set-up activities and include a one-time set-up fee. This
one-time set-up fee is generally paid by the client at contract execution. We have determined that these set-up activities do not constitute a separate unit of accounting, and accordingly the related set-up fees are recognized ratably over the term
of the contract. We consider the applicability of EITF00-3, Application of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, to
Arrangements That Include the Right to Use Software Stored on Another Entitys Hardware, to our remote hosting services arrangements on a contract-by-contract basis. If we determine that the client has the contractual right to take
possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty, and can feasibly run the software on its own hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the software, a software element covered
by SOP97-2 exists. When a software element exists in a remote hosting services arrangement, we recognize the license, professional services and remote hosting services revenues pursuant to SOP97-2, whereby the fair value of the remote
hosting service is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the remote hosting contract. If we determine that a software element covered by SOP97-2 is not present in a remote hosting services arrangement, we recognize revenue for the
remote hosting services arrangement ratably over the term of the remote hosting contract pursuant to SAB104. Traditional Software Contracts 
We enter into traditional multiple-element arrangements that include the following elements:  Software license;  Maintenance;  Professional services; and  Third party hardware or remote hosting services. Revenue for each of the elements is recognized as follows: Software license fees are recognized upon delivery of the software provided that
1there is evidence of an arrangement, 2the fee is fixed or determinable and 3collection of our fee is considered probable. For those arrangements in which the fee is not considered fixed or determinable, the software license
revenue is recognized as the payments become due. For arrangements where VSOE only exists for the undelivered elements, we account for the delivered elements software license revenue using the residual method in accordance with SOP98-9.
In addition to the software license fees, these contracts may also contain maintenance, professional services and hardware or remote hosting services.
VSOE and revenue recognition for these elements is determined using the same methodology as noted above for subscription contracts. 
47  Software Contracts Requiring Contract Accounting We enter into certain multiple element arrangements containing milestone provisions in which the professional services are considered essential to the functionality of the software. Under these arrangements, software
license fees and professional service revenues are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method over the implementation period which generally ranges from 12 to 24months. Under the percentage-of-completion method, revenue and profit
are recognized throughout the term of the implementation based upon estimates of total labor hours incurred and revenues to be generated over the term of the implementation. Changes in estimates of total labor hours and the related effect on the
timing of revenues and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable. Accordingly, changes in these estimates could occur and have a material effect on our operating results in the period of change. Stand-Alone Software and Services We also market certain software
and services on a stand-alone basis, including the following:  Software license;  Maintenance;  Professional services;  Hardware;  Outsourcing; and  Remote Hosting services. Revenues related to such
software and services are recognized as follows: Software license fees and maintenance marketed on a stand-alone basis may be licensed either under
traditional contracts or under subscription arrangements. Software license fees under traditional contracts are recognized pursuant to SOP97-2 when the following criteria are met, delivery of the software has occurred, persuasive evidence of
an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. Under subscription agreements for stand-alone software, license fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract. With respect to maintenance, VSOE is
determined based on substantive renewal prices contained in the contracts. Maintenance is recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Professional
services represent incremental services marketed to clients including implementation and consulting services. Professional services revenues, where VSOE is based on prices from stand-alone transactions are recognized as services are performed.
Hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery pursuant to SAB104. We provide outsourcing services to our clients. Under these arrangements we assume full, partial or transitional responsibilities for a healthcare organizations IT operations using our employees. Our outsourcing
services include facilities management, network outsourcing and transition management. These arrangements typically range from five to ten years in duration. Revenues from these arrangements are recognized when services are performed. Remote hosting contracts that are sold on a stand alone basis are recognized ratably over the contract term pursuant to SAB104. Our remote hosting arrangements
generally require us to perform one-time set-up activities and include a one-time set-up fee. This one-time set-up fee is generally paid by the client at contract execution. We have determined that these set-up activities do not constitute a
separate unit of accounting, and accordingly we recognize the related set-up fees ratably over the term of the contract. The Company records reimbursable
out-of-pocket expenses in both systems and services revenues and as a direct cost of system and services in accordance with EITF 01-14, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out-of-Pocket Expenses
Incurred. In 2007, 2006, and 2005 reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses were $116 million, $90 million, $92 million, respectively. Network service
arrangements include the assessment, assembly and delivery of a wireless network which may include wireless carts or other wireless equipment to the client. Our network services arrangements are sold to a client for a fixed fee. All services are
performed prior to the delivery of the equipment. These contracts are typically 60 to 90days in length and are recognized pursuant to SAB104, upon the delivery of the network to the client. We exited the network services business in
2007. 
48  Costs of Revenues The principal costs of systems and services revenues are salaries, benefits and related overhead costs for implementation, maintenance, remote hosting and outsourcing personnel. Other significant costs include third party costs, software
rental and maintenance and the amortization of capitalized software development costs and acquired technology intangible assets. Capitalized software development costs are generally amortized over three years on a straight-line basis commencing upon
general release of the related software, or are based on the ratio that current revenues bear to total anticipated revenues for the applicable software. Acquired technology is amortized over three to five years based upon the estimated economic life
of the underlying asset.Cost of revenues related to hardware sales includes our cost to acquire the hardware from the manufacturer. Shipping
Costs In accordance with EITF 00-10, Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees, the Company classifies the re-imbursement by clients of
shipping and handling costs as revenue and the associated cost as cost of revenue. Sales Taxes In accordance with EITF 06-3, How Sales Taxes Collected from Clients and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement That is,
Gross Versus Net Presentation, the Company reports sales taxes collected from clients and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis, that is both the sales tax expense and the associated re-imbursement by clients are classified as
expenses. Research and Development Research and
development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and related overhead, as well as consulting costs related to design, development and testing of new software. We capitalize certain software development costs subsequent to attaining technological feasibility. These costs are amortized as an element of the cost of systems and
services. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes
and corresponding balance sheet accounts are determined in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109. Under SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary
differences between the bases of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and financial reporting purposes. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified according to the financial statement classification of the net assets and
liabilities generating the differences. The Company provides a valuation allowance for that portion of deferred tax assets, which it cannot determine is more likely than not to be recognized. Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, FIN 48. This
interpretation clarifies the criteria for recognizing income tax benefits under FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and requires additional disclosures about uncertain tax positions. Under FIN 48 the financial statement
recognition of the benefit for a tax position is dependent upon the benefit being more likely than not, based on its technical merits, to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable taxing authority. If this threshold is met, the tax benefit is then
measured and recognized at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Upon adoption of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007, the Company recognized no increase in its liability for unrecognized income
tax benefits. The Company accounts for any applicable interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. We file
income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, numerous states, Canada and India. All federal, state and international jurisdictions are open to examination due to net operating loss carryforwards. Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based employee
compensation arrangements in accordance with SFAS 123R, as adopted effective January1, 2006. Prior to January1, 2006, we accounted for our stock-based employee compensation arrangements under the intrinsic value method prescribed by
APB 25, as allowed by SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148. As a result, no expense was recognized for options to purchase our common stock that were granted with an exercise price equal to fair market value at the date of grant and no expense was
recognized in connection with purchases under our employee stock purchase plan prior to January1, 2006. 
49  We elected to adopt SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method. Under this method, compensation cost recognized
during the period includes: acompensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123
amortized over the awards vesting period, and bcompensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to January1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R
amortized on a straight-line basis over the awards vesting period. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with weighted average assumptions for the activity under our
stock plans. Option pricing model input assumptions such as expected term, expected volatility, and risk-free interest rate, impact the fair value estimate. Further, the forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate compensation. These assumptions
are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop. When estimating fair value, some of the assumptions were based on or determined from external data for example, the risk free interest rate and other assumptions
were derived from our historical experience with share-based payment arrangements for example, volatility and expected term. The appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment, based on relevant facts and
circumstances. Pro forma results for 2005 have not been restated. We have elected to use the simplified method for estimating our expected term equal to
the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual term as allowed by SAB 107, Share-Based Payment. We currently estimate volatility by using the weighted average historical volatility of our common stock. The risk-free interest
rate is the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term input to the Black-Scholes model. We estimate forfeitures using a weighted average historical forfeiture rate. Our
estimate of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from our estimate. Concentration of Credit Risk Our clients operate primarily in the healthcare industry. We sell our software and
services under contracts with varying terms. The accounts receivable amounts are unsecured. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover credit losses. Revenue related to one of our customers represented 10% of total
revenues for the year ended December31, 2007. Foreign Currency Our financial position and results of operations of our subsidiaries, with the exception of our subsidiary in India, are measured using the currency of the respective countries as the functional currency. Assets and
liabilities are translated at the foreign exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date, while revenue and expenses for the year are translated at the average exchange rate in effect during the year. Translation gains and losses are not included
in determining net income or loss but are accumulated and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity. The functional currency of our
Indian subsidiary is the U.S. dollar, with monetary assets and liabilities remeasured into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses remeasured at average rates prevailing during the year. We have not entered into any hedging contracts during the three-year period ended December31, 2007. New Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued SFAS
No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS 159 allows us an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements.
SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Eclipsys is evaluating the impact on its financial statements from adopting SFAS 159.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157 Fair Value Measurements. SFAS 157 enhances existing guidance for measuring assets and liabilities
using fair value. Prior to the issuance of SFAS 157, guidance for applying fair value was incorporated in several accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 provides a single definition of fair value, together with a framework for measuring it, and
requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS 157 also emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the
highest priority being quoted prices in active markets. Under SFAS 157, fair value measurements are disclosed by level within that hierarchy. Certain provisions of SFAS 157 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after November15, 2007, and interim 
50  
periods within those fiscal years, while the effective date for certain other provisions has been deferred to fiscal years beginning after November15,
2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Eclipsys is evaluating the impact on its financial statements from adopting SFAS 157. In June 2006,
EITF 06-3 How Sales Taxes Collected from Clients and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement That is, Gross Versus Net Presentation, was issued. EITF 06-3 requires disclosure of the presentation
of taxes on either a gross included in revenues and costs or a net excluded from revenue basis as an accounting policy decision. The provisions of this standard are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after
December15, 2006. The adoption of EITF 06-3 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.  3.

Auction rate securities are variable-rate debt securities. While the underlying security has a long-term nominal maturity, dutch auctions are typically held every 7, 28, or 35 days.
On these reset dates, the holders of the securities have the opportunity to increase buy, decrease sell or hold their investment. If the auctions are successful, they provide an opportunity the Company to sell or reset the interest rate on the
security, creating a short-term instrument. The securities generally trade at par and are callable at par on any interest payment date at the option of the issuer. Interest is paid at the end of each auction period. See Note 19 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for subsequent event information related to auction rate securities.  2
As of December31, 2007 the maturity dates of other securities range from one to two years. Eclipsys practice for all securities in the portfolio is typically to hold them less than one year, and therefore, we believe that these investments are part of working capital and are appropriately classified
as current assets. We classify all of our marketable securities as available for sale. Gross realized gains and losses for the periods ended
December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 as well as gross unrealized gains and losses as of December31, 2007 and 2006 are immaterial to our financial statements.

Stockholders Equity Undesignated Preferred Stock 
We have available for issuance, 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As discussed below under Shareholder Rights Plan, Eclipsys Board of
Directors has designated 100,000 of the 5,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. Eclipsys has a balance of 4,900,000 authorized shares of undesignated preferred stock, the Undesignated
Preferred. The liquidation, voting, conversion and other related provisions of the Undesignated Preferred will be determined by the Board of Directors at the time of issuance. Currently, there are no outstanding preferred shares.  Shareholder
Rights Plan On July26, 2000, our Board of Directors declared
a dividend of one Right for each outstanding share of Eclipsys Common Stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on August9, 2000. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from Eclipsys one one-thousandth of a
share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $001 par value per share, at a Purchase Price of $6500 in cash, subject to adjustment. The Rights will initially trade together with Eclipsys Common Stock, and will not be exercisable.
If a person or group other than an exempt person acquires 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Eclipsys Common Stock, the Rights generally will become exercisable and allow the holder other than the 15% purchaser to purchase shares of
Eclipsys Common Stock at a 50% discount to the market price. The effect will be to discourage acquisitions of 15% or more of Eclipsys Common Stock without negotiations with the Board of Directors. The terms of the Rights are set forth in
a Rights Agreement dated as of July26, 2000, the Rights Agreement, between Eclipsys and Fleet National Bank, as Rights Agent. The Board has designated 100,000 of the 5,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock as Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock.

Employee Benefit Plans 2005 Stock Incentive Plan
At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders held June29, 2005, our shareholders approved the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2005 Plan. Under the
2005 Plan, no further awards will be granted under our prior Stock Incentive Plans which include our 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000 plans. Awards may be made under the 2005 Plan for a number of shares subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits
and other similar events equal to the sum of 12,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock, 2any shares reserved for issuance under the Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Incentive Plan that remain available for issuance as of
the date the 2005 Plan was approved by our stockholders and 3any shares subject to outstanding awards under our 1996 Stock Plan, the Amended and Restated 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, the Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Incentive Plan and the
Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Incentive Plan that expire or are terminated, surrendered or canceled without having been fully exercised, are repurchased or forfeited in whole or part or result in any shares subject to such award not being issued.
We expect to satisfy option exercises by issuing the Companys common stock. As of December31, 2007, there were 11million shares available for future issuance under the 2005 Plan. 2005 Inducement Grant Stock Incentive Plan During 2006 we issued
400,000 stock options and 100,000 shares of restricted stock as an inducement grant made without stockholder approval and outside the 2005 Plan. Awards
granted under these plans generally have a contractual life of 7 to 10 years and generally vest over a 3 to 5 year period. Stock Options

ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of December31, 2007, $61 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to
non-vested restricted awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 319 years.The fair value of shares vested in each of the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $27 million, $60 million and $08
million, respectively. Deferred Stock Units Effective
May10, 2006, we implemented a deferred stock unit plan to provide for equity compensation for our non-employee directors in the form of deferred stock units, or DSUs, granted under the 2005 Plan. As of the date of each annual meeting of the
Companys stockholders, each continuing non-employee director receives a number of DSUs determined by dividing $75,000 by the fair market value of a share of the Companys common stock on the grant date. These DSUs vest quarterly over the
course of the ensuing year. After cessation of board service, the Company will pay the DSUs by issuing to the former director a number of shares of the Company common stock equal to the number of accumulated vested deferred stock units. In
addition, a non-employee director may elect to receive DSUs in lieu of all or a portion of his or her cash fees. All DSUs received for cash fees are fully vested. 
55  We granted 24,086 and 26,459 deferred stock units at an average market value of $2344 and $1891 during the years ended
December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The value of these deferred stock units is amortized to compensation expense and director fees ratably over the vesting period. Expense recorded for deferred stock units was $586,000 and $313,000 in the
years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Employee Savings Plan During 1997, we established a Savings Plan pursuant to Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code, whereby employees may contribute a percentage of their compensation, not to exceed the maximum
amount allowable under the Code. At the discretion of our Board of Directors, we may elect to make matching contributions, as defined in the Savings Plan. For the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 the Board of Directors approved
contributions to the Savings Plan of $15 million, $13 million, and $06 million, respectively. 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan On June29, 2005, our shareholders approved the 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2005 Purchase Plan. In connection with the approval, the Second Amended and
Restated 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan was terminated and no further awards will be made under such plan.Under the provisions of the 2005 Purchase Plan, our employees may purchase shares of our stock at a purchase price of 95% of the
closing price of our stock on the final day of the yearly offering period as defined.There were 19,568 shares issued under the 2005 Purchase Plan as a result of employee participation during the year ended December31, 2007. As of
December31, 2007, there were 929,946 shares available for future issuance under the 2005 Purchase Plan.  9.

Restructuring In January 2006, we effected a restructuring of our
operations which included a reduction in headcount of approximately 100 individuals and the reorganization of our Company. In December 2006, we realigned certain management resources and consolidated some facilities to eliminate excess office space.
These activities resulted in total restructuring charges of $147 million, which were incurred in the year ended December31, 2006. Severance charges
were $122 million, of which $28 million was for non-cash stock-based compensation. The excess office space consolidation resulted in charges of $25 million related to the closing of three of our facilities. The remaining liability as of
December31, 2007 is expected to be paid out through 2009. A summary of the 2007 and 2006 restructuring activity related to the 2006 actions is as

Raton, Florida to Atlanta, Georgia. The intent of the restructuring plan is to consolidate more of the Companys operations in one location, reduce overhead costs, and provide a more accessible location for existing and potential clients as
well as employees. The charges related to this plan primarily consist of severance-related expenses associated with the termination of impacted employees and include one-time termination benefits and retention-bonus expenses. Total restructuring
expenses in connection with this plan are expected to approximate $23 million, of which $12 million has been incurred as of December31, 2007. The relocation of the corporate headquarters is expected to be complete in the first quarter of
2008, with the related payments made during the first and second quarters of 2008.

59  As of December31, 2007, the Company had U.S. net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of
approximately $308 million.Of this amount, $11 million expires in 2012 and $21 million expires in 2018; the balance expires in varying amounts through 2026.Of the total U.S. net operating loss carryforward, $89 million relates to stock
option tax deductions which will be tax-effected and the benefit credited as additional paid-in-capital when realized.Additionally, the Company has Canadian net operating loss carryovers of approximately $21 million that expire in varying
amounts through 2026. The Companys Indian subsidiary is entitled to a tax holiday which expires in 2009. As of December 31, 2007, the Companys
ability to use a portion of its federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future taxable income is subject to restrictions attributable to equity transactions that resulted in a change of ownership during its 1998 tax year as
defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 382. We do not expect that the limitations placed on this portion of the Companys NOLs as a result of this change in ownership will result in the expiration of its NOL carryforwards. However, future
equity transactions could limit the utilization of its existing NOLs. As of December31, 2007, a valuation allowance of approximately $87 million has
been established against the U.S. deferred tax assets that management does not believe are more likely than not to be realized.This determination is based primarily on the Companys recent history of taxable losses, operating losses and
uncertainty with respect to its forecasted results.We will continue to assess the requirement for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis.Should the Company achieve its 2008 forecasted results, it may be that we determine from our
valuation allowance assessment that the positive evidence outweighs the negative resulting in the release of all or a portion of the allowance. In the
fourth quarter 2007, we concluded that is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in Canada will be recovered from future taxable income. Accordingly, in 2007, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $5 million for the reversal of the
tax valuation allowance related to our Canadian operation. Eclipsys intends to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of its foreign
subsidiaries. Accordingly, no deferred taxes have been recorded for the difference between its financial and tax basis investment in its foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were distributed to the U.S.in the form of dividends, or
otherwise, the Company would have additional U.S.taxable income and, depending on the Companys tax posture in the year of repatriation, may have to pay additional U.S.income taxes. Withholding taxes may also apply to the
repatriated earnings. Determination of the amount of unrecognized income tax liability related to these permanently reinvested and undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings is currently not practicable. Effective January1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, FIN48.
This interpretation clarifies the criteria for recognizing income tax benefits under FASB Statement No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and requires additional disclosures about uncertain tax positions. Under FIN 48 the financial
statement recognition of the benefit for a tax position is dependent upon the benefit being more likely than not, based on its technical merits, to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable taxing authority. If this threshold is met, the tax
benefit is then measured and recognized at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Upon adoption of FIN 48 on January1, 2007, the Company recognized no increase in its liability for
unrecognized income tax benefits. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the consolidated liability for unrecognized income tax benefits during the year ended December31, 2007 is as follows in thousands:  2007
Balance at January1, 2007 Additions for tax positions of prior years 548
Additions for tax positions related to 2007 168
Reductions for tax positions of prior years Settlements Balance at December31, 2007 716 Of the $07 million of additions, $06 million would affect the Companys effective income tax rate in the
respective period of change. The Company accounts for any applicable interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. The liability for uncertain income taxes as of December31, 2007 and income tax expense
for the year ended December31, 2007 include interest and penalties of $02 million. The Companys tax returns filed in multiple jurisdictions
are subject to audit by taxing authorities. Years with net operating losses that can be carried forward remain open for audit until the net operating loss is utilized or expires. As of December31, 2007, the earliest years remaining open for
audit and/or settlement in our major taxing jurisdictions are as follows: United States 1997 and Canada 2001.

Commitments and Contingencies In July and August of 2007, four
purported stockholder derivative complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against certain current and former directors and officers of Eclipsys and Eclipsys as a nominal defendant, alleging that
during the period from at least 1999 until 2006 certain of Eclipsys option grants were backdated and that as a result of this alleged backdating the Companys financial statements were misstated, and stock sales by the named defendants
constituted improper insider selling. These complaints were consolidated in November 2007. The Company is currently unable to predict the outcome of the litigation or to reasonably estimate the range of potential loss, if any. However, dealing with
this litigation has required the Company to incur substantial legal expenses, which affected the Companys financial results for 2007 and will continue to affect the Companys 2008 results as well. The derivative litigation also could
result in management distraction and adverse publicity and resulting reputational harm, which could impair the Companys sales and marketing efforts. In addition to the foregoing, the Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims incident to their business activities. Such matters may include, among other things, assertions of
contract breach or intellectual property infringement, claims for indemnity arising in the course of our business and claims by persons whose employment with us has been terminated. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not
predictable with assurance. Consequently, management is unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability, amounts which may be covered by insurance or recoverable from third parties, or the financial impact with respect to
these matters as of December31, 2007. However, based on our knowledge as of December31, 2007, management believes that the final resolution of such matters pending at the time of this report, individually and in the aggregate, will not
have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Non-cancelable Operating Leases
We lease office space and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Rental expense under operating leases was $117 million, $83
million, and $94 million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Future minimum rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of December31, 2007 are as follows:  inthousands
Year Ending December 31 2008 9,640
2009 9,286
2010 6,882
2011 4,640
2012 4,255
Thereafter 16,387 51,090 We have unconditional purchase obligations that consist of minimum purchase commitments for telecommunication
services, computer equipment, maintenance, consulting and other commitments. In aggregate, these obligations total approximately $802 million. These obligations will require payments of $560million in 2008, with the majority of the balance
occurring within the next three years. Indemnification clauses Our standard software license agreements contain indemnification clauses that are limited in amount. Pursuant to these clauses, we indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the
indemnified party. We account for these clauses under FASB Staff Position FIN 45 45-1: Accounting for Intellectual Property Infringement Indemnifications under FASB Interpretation No45. Accordingly, there are no liabilities recorded for these
agreements as of December31, 2007.  13.
Acquisitions In December 2006, we acquired Van Slyck
Associates, Inc., or VSA. VSA is a patient classification, acuity-driven nurse staffing service and software company. The aggregate purchase consideration
included $15 million in cash, as well as earnout consideration of up to approximately $25 million payable in cash over a two-year period, based on the attainment of conditions defined in the acquisition agreement. All future consideration paid
under the earn-out provisions of the agreement, if any, will be recorded as additional goodwill. The operating results of VSA have been combined with those of Eclipsys since December15, 2006. 
61  As a result of the VSA acquisition, we recorded non-tax deductible goodwill of $09 million and other intangible assets
including client relationships of $03 million and acquired technology of $04 million. Amortizable intangible assets include client relationships and acquired technology, and are being amortized over five and three-year periods on a straight-line
basis, respectively, which we believe reflects the estimated expected utility of these assets. On June11, 2006, we entered into an agreement to
acquire both the assets of Sysware Health Care Systems, Inc., or Sysware, and the stock of Syswares sister company Mosum Technology India Private Limited, or Mosum. In July 2006, we closed the asset acquisition of Sysware. We closed the
stock acquisition of Mosum, which is based in India, in December, 2006, once all the Indian regulatory approvals were received. The acquisition of these affiliated companies enabled us to market Syswares laboratory information solution as a
core module of Eclipsys Sunrise Clinical Manager suite of enterprise-wide advanced clinical solutions, and also provided us with the foundation for a development and support organization in India. The aggregate purchase consideration included $37 million in cash, as well as earnout consideration of up to approximately $39 million payable in a combination of cash
and shares of our common stock over a two-year period, based on the attainment of conditions defined in the acquisition agreement. All future consideration paid under the earn-out provisions of the agreement, if any, will be recorded as additional
goodwill. The operating results of Sysware and Mosum have been combined with those of Eclipsys since July14, 2006. In October 2007, we changed the name of Mosum to Eclipsys India Private Limited. As a result of the Sysware acquisition, we recorded tax deductible goodwill of $30 million and other intangible assets including client relationships of $10 million
and acquired technology of $07 million. Amortizable intangible assets include client relationships and acquired technology, and are being amortized over five and three-year periods on a straight-line basis, respectively, which we believe reflect
the estimated expected utility of these assets. In each of these acquisitions, we assigned the total purchase price to the assets, liabilities and
identifiable intangible assets acquired with the remaining amount assigned to goodwill. Under the provisions of the earn-out agreements related to the
acquisitions, we recorded incremental goodwill of $09 and $17 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In connection with these earn-outs, we issued 62,063 and 76,458 shares of our common stock in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and paid cash
consideration totaling $13 million and $10 million, respectively.  14.
Sale of Assets In December 2007, the Company entered into an Asset
Purchase Agreement with Elsevier Inc. Elsevier pursuant to which Elsevier acquired certain assets of our Clinical Practice Model Resource Center CPMRC business including CPMRCs proprietary clinical practice
guidelines and related intellectual property; content, assumed certain CPMRC content customer contracts and retained related CPMRC employees for $231 million in cash. The transaction resulted in a net gain of $128 million comprised of
the following: in thousands:  Cash received 23,134 CPMRC earnout settlement payment 5,100 Net assets sold 4,755 Other costs 518 Gain on sale 12,761 In connection with this transaction the Company, for $51 million, settled the remaining earnout obligation under
the 2004 CPMRC acquisition agreement and reflected this as a reduction of the gain on sale. In addition to the aforementioned proceeds from sale, we can
earn up to an additional $110 million over the next 3 years in the event Elsevier meets certain sales targets, we are successful in obtaining permission from a customer to transfer its contract to Elsevier, and we complete certain minor data base
application development for Elsevier. If these milestones are met, we would reflect any contingent consideration received as additional gain on the sale of CPMRC. 
62  In connection with the sale, the Company and Elsevier entered into reseller and license agreements to allow Eclipsys to
continue to acquire CPMRC content and services from Elsevier in order to support existing and possible new customers who use Eclipsys Knowledge-Based Charting software application, which contains the CPMRC content.  15.
Related Party Transactions License Agreement with Partners
HealthCare System, Inc. We have a license agreement with Partners HealthCare System, Inc., or Partners. Mr. Jay Pieper, a director of Eclipsys, is
Vice President of Corporate Development and Treasury Affairs for Partners. Under the terms of this license, we may develop, commercialize, distribute and support certain technology of Partners, or the Partners Technology, and license it, as
well as sell related services, to other healthcare providers and hospitals throughout the world with the exception of the Boston, Massachusetts metropolitan area. No royalties are payable by us pursuant to the license with Partners. In 2001,
Partners entered into a contract with us for the license of a new software application and related professional services. This new software application consisted of an upgrade to an existing software application that Partners had licensed from
Transition Systems, Inc, an entity that was acquired by us in December 1998. Under this new contract, Partners paid us the sums of $12 million, $09 million and $09 million, in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of December31, 2007,
Partners owed us the sum of approximately $01 million related to this contract. Mr.Pieper was not affiliated with Eclipsys at the time of the negotiation of the Partners license from Transition Systems, Inc. Investment in Healthvision, Inc. The Company historically
held an investment in a related party, Healthvision, Inc, or Healthvision.This investment was accounted for as an equity method investment, which had a zero basis reflecting cumulative losses. In October 2007, Healthvision was acquired by
Quovadx Inc.The Company received zero proceeds from this transaction and therefore no gain or loss was recorded on the disposition of our investment.The Company has no continuing ownership in Healthvision. Lease Agreement and Cost-Sharing Arrangement with BG Jet Corp. Effective March1, 2007, we entered into a Lease Agreement and a Cost Sharing Agreement, each with BG Jet Corp., and an Assignment and Consent among Eclipsys, BG Jet Corp, NetJets Sales, Inc., NetJets Services, Inc. and NetJets
Aviation, Inc. BG Jet Corp. is 50% owned by Mr.Eugene Fife, one of our directors and the Chairman of our Board. The NetJets entities are affiliated companies that in the aggregate provide a fractional aircraft interest and related services to
BG Jet Corp. This arrangement had an initial term of 11 months and has been renewed upon agreement of the parties. The agreement was renewed for a 11 month period in February of 2008. Either Eclipsys or BG Jet Corp. may terminate the arrangement if
Mr.Fifes service on our Board ceases, or as a result of a change in control of Eclipsys, or upon loss of use of the aircraft that is subject to the fractional interest, or upon transfer of the fractional interest in whole or part by BG
Jet Corp. During the year ended December31, 2007, we paid $139,000 to BG Jet Corp. under this arrangement.

Basic and Diluted Net Income Per Share For all periods presented,
basic and diluted net income per common share is presented in accordance with SFAS 128 Earnings per Share, which provides for the accounting principles used in the calculation of earnings per share. Basic net income per common 
64  
share excludes dilution and is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share reflects the potential dilution from assumed conversion of all dilutive securities such as stock options and unvested restricted stock using the treasury stock method. When the
effects of the outstanding stock options are anti-dilutive, they are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share. For the year ended December31, 2007, anti-dilutive stock options totaling 35million shares were
excluded from the determination of diluted earnings per common share. The computations of the basic and diluted earnings per common share were as follows:

Subsequent Event Auction Rate Securities 
As of December 31, 2007, the Company had approximately $191 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities. Of these amounts, approximately
$166 million was invested in auction-rate securities ARS, comprising certain AAA rated notes backed by insured student loans with long-term nominal maturities for which the interest rates are reset through a dutch auction
each month. The monthly auctions historically have provided a liquid market for these securities. In February 2008, the broker-dealers managing the
Companys ARS portfolio experienced failed auctions of certain of these securities where the amount of securities submitted for sale exceeded the amount of purchase orders. The ARS continue to pay interest according to their stated terms and
the ARS held by the Company have not been downgraded nor have they been placed on credit watch. If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets
continue, these markets deteriorate further or the Company experiences any rating downgrades on any investments in its portfolio including on ARS, the Company may incur temporary or other-than-temporary impairments, which could negatively affect
the Companys financial condition, cash flow and reported earnings. Additionally, a continued deterioration in market conditions that lead us to conclude our marketable securities are not available to fund current operations would result in us
classifying our ARS as noncurrent assets. 
65  Secured Financing On February 15, 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with an investment bank, pursuant to which the Company received $45 million in exchange for a transfer to the bank of ARS with a nominal value of $90 million in the aggregate. The
Company is obligated to repay the bank and the bank is obligated to transfer the ARS back to the Company on May 15, 2008, subject to earlier transfer back to the Company at the Companys discretion the Repayment Date. The
arrangement has been amended to permit the Company to extend the Repayment Date to August 15, 2008 if not in default under the arrangement on May 15, subject to compliance with the margin requirement described below. The repayment obligation
includes the original $45 million with interest payable monthly at a rate measured at 3 month LIBOR plus 15% through May 15, 2008, increasing to 3 month LIBOR plus 35% if the Repayment Date extends beyond May 15, 2008 collectively and net of any
cash payments made, the Repayment Amount. If the market value as determined by the bank in its reasonable discretion of the ARS falls below 140% of the Repayment Amount, the Company may be required immediately to transfer to the bank
additional cash or securities such that the total value of the ARS and all additional transferred cash and securities would be at least 150% of the Repayment Amount, and thereafter to maintain that 150% margin until the Repayment Date, provided that
the Company may not extend the Repayment Date to August 15, 2008 as described above if the market value of the ARS and all additional transferred cash and securities is not at least 176% of the Repayment Amount on May 15, 2008. Any such additional
cash and securities would be transferred back to the Company, along with the ARS, for the Repayment Amount on the Repayment Date. The Company entered into
this arrangement to provide funds to close the February 2008 acquisition of Enterprise Performance Systems, Inc. EPSi. See EPSi acquisition below for more information. EPSi acquisition On February25, 2008, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
EPSi, a private company, for $53 million in cash paid at closing, subject to certain holdback arrangements and working capital adjustments. EPSi is a leading provider of business intelligence solutions, including web-based software and related
consulting services,that allow clients in the healthcare industry to improve financial performance and operational decision making.
