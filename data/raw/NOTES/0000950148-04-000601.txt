Item8. Inherent in the application of many of these
accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates
and judgments in the determination of certain revenues,
expenses, assets and liabilities. As such, materially different
financial results can occur as circumstances change and
additional information becomes known. The policies with the
greatest potential effect on our results of operation and
financial position include The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment
of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the
aging of the accounts receivable. If there were a deterioration
of a major customers creditworthiness, or actual defaults
were higher than our historical experience, our estimates of the
recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, which
could have an adverse impact on our operating results. Our revenue recognition policy is significant because our
revenue is a key component of our results of operations. In
addition, our revenue recognition determines the timing of
certain expenses, such as commissions and royalties. We follow
very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenues;
however, certain judgments affect the application of our revenue
policy. Revenue results are difficult to predict, and any
shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause
our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to
quarter. We assess the impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider
important which could trigger an impairment review include the
following   
significant underperformance relative to expected historical or
projected future operating results     
significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired
assets or the strategy for our overall business; and     
significant negative industry or economic trends. When we determine that the carrying value of long-lived assets
and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of
one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure
any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method
using a discount rate determined by our management to be
commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business
model. Net long-lived assets, including goodwill, amounted to
$2415 million as of December31, 2003.
16 Table of Contents Recent Developments On May31, 2003, we purchased certain product lines,
including ColorWorkshop and Blopens, assets and
assumed certain liabilities of PMProducts USA, Inc.
and an affiliated United Kingdom company, PM Products
Limited collectively PM. The total purchase
price of approximately $220million consisted of all cash
and the assumption of certain liabilities and resulted in
goodwill of $168million. Our results of operations have
included PM from the date of acquisition. Results of Operation The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated,

Years Ended December31, 2003 and 2002 Net Sales. Net sales were $3158million in 2003
compared to $3100million in 2002, representing an
increase of 19%. The contribution to net sales by our seasonal
products, including Trendmasters, Go Fly a Kite, Funnoodle
and sports toys, and new product introductions, including
Dragon Ball and NASCAR action toys, TV games and
ColorWorkshop craft products, were offset by a decrease
in sales in our traditional products, and international sales,
which included a reduction in sales of our karaoke machines and
Equalizer radio control vehicle in 2003, both higher priced
items. Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased $39million,
or 30%, to $1266million, or 401% of net sales, in 2003
from $1306million, or 421% of net sales, in 2002. The
overall decrease in gross profit was attributable to a decrease
in gross profit margin. The decrease in gross profit margin of
20% of net sales was due to higher sales of seasonal products
with lower margins and an increase in royalty expense as a
percentage of net sales due to changes in the product mix
resulting from the sale of more products with higher royalty
rates, though offset in part by a decrease in amortization
expense of molds and tools used in the manufacture of our
products. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling,
general and administrative expenses were $1058million in
2003 and $918million in 2002, constituting 335% and
296% of net sales, respectively. The overall increase of
$140million in such costs was primarily due to a charge
for
17 Table of Contents the grant of restricted stock of $84million, a charge of
$21million to bad debt relating to the bankruptcy of
several of our customers, including Kay Bee Toys, and an
increase in direct selling expenses, product development costs,
option compensation expense resulting from the price reset of
options in 2000 and operating expenses incurred in connection
with the PM asset acquisition. We produced and aired
television commercials in support of several of our products,
including WWE and Dragon BallZ action
figures and Flying Colors products in 2003 and WWE
action figures and Flying Colors products in 2002. From
time to time, we may increase our advertising efforts, if we
deem it appropriate for particular products. Acquisition Shut-down and Recall Costs. Acquisition
shut-down costs in 2002 relate to shut-down costs, including
lease termination, fixed asset abandonment and other costs, of
certain operations of Toymax and Kidz Biz. There were no such
costs in 2003. Operations impacted by these shut-downs were
sales, design, distribution, and administration. The
integrations of Toymax and Kidz Biz were completed in 2002. In
2003, we accrued a net amount of $20million for the
recall of one of our products, compared to having accrued
$22million in 2002 for the recall of the same product. The remaining component of the acquisition shut-down and recall
costs is as follows in thousands

Profit from Joint Venture. Profit from joint venture
decreased by $07million in 2003 due to the joint venture
having lower unit sales at lower wholesale prices of its two
vehicle combat games of the five games released in 2003 compared
to releasing all new titles with higher unit sales at higher
wholesale prices in addition to having higher sales of carryover
titles in 2002. New releases typically generate higher unit
sales resulting in higher overall sales as compared to carryover
titles. Profit from the joint venture contributed significantly
to our pre-tax profit, representing 195% of pre-tax income in
2002 and 222% in 2003. We expect to continue to receive a
preferred return over the remaining term of the license
agreement ending December31, 2009, although we cannot
predict with certainty what levels of return will be achieved
and, in any case, we anticipate substantial fluctuations in the
amount of the preferred return distributed to us from year to
year. Interest Net. Interest income increased due to higher
average cash balances during 2003 than in 2002, but was offset
by interest expense of $25million related to the
convertible notes issued in June2003. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes
included Federal, state and foreign income taxes in 2002 and
2003, at an effective tax rate of 220% and 17% in 2002 and
2003, respectively, benefiting from a flat 165% and 170%, Hong
Kong Corporation Tax on our income arising in, or derived from,
Hong Kong for 2002 and 2003, respectively. For 2003, the
effective rate decreased as a result of a higher proportionate
share of income arising in HongKong as opposed to income
arising in the higher statutory jurisdictions. As of
December31, 2003, we had deferred tax assets of
approximately $40million for which no allowance has been
provided since, in the opinion of management, realization of the
future benefit is probable. In making this determination,
management believes it considered all available evidence, both
positive and negative, as well as the weight and importance
given to such evidence.
18 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 Net Sales. Net sales increased $257million, or
90%, to $3100million in 2002 from $2843million in
2001. The growth in net sales was due primarily to the addition
of the Toymax products and continuing growth in sales of our
Flying Colors and Doll products which was offset in part
by a decrease in sales of our Wheels division, consisting
primarily of our Road Champs die-cast toy and collectible
vehicles with its extreme sports products. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased $105million,
or 87%, to $1306million in 2002, or 421% of net sales,
from $1201million, or 422% of net sales, in 2001. The
overall increase in gross profit was attributable to the
increase in net sales. Gross profit margin was compatible to
last year as lower margins for Toymax products were offset by
the decrease in royalty expense as a percentage of net sales due
to changes in the product mix resulting from the sale of more
products with lower royalty rates or proprietary products with
no royalties. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling,
general and administrative expenses were $918 million in 2002
and $896million in 2001, constituting 296% and 315% of
net sales, respectively. The overall increase of
$22million in such costs was due to costs incurred in
support of our Kidz Biz and Toymax acquisitions and increased
media buys, offset in part by a decrease in Goodwill
amortization expense based on the implementation of
SFAS142. The decrease as a percentage of net sales is
primarily attributable to the relative fixed nature of certain
expenses with a concurrent increase in net sales. We produced
and aired television commercials in support of several of our
products, including WWE action figures and Flying
Colors products, in 2001 and 2002. From time to time, we may
increase our advertising efforts, if we deem it appropriate for
particular products. Acquisition Shut-down and Recall Costs. Acquisition
shut-down costs in 2002 relate to shut-down costs, including
lease termination, fixed asset abandonment and other costs, of
certain operations of Toymax and Kidz Biz. Such costs in 2001
relate to shut-down costs of certain operations of Pentech,
acquired in 2000. Operations impacted by these shut-downs were
sales, design, distribution and administration. The integration
of Pentech was completed in 2001 and the integration of Toymax
and Kidz Biz was completed in 2002. In 2002, we accrued
$22million for the recall of one of our products. The components of the acquisition shut-down and recall costs are

Profit from Joint Venture. Profit from joint venture
increased by $13million in 2002 due to the joint venture
having sales of only carryover titles in 2001 compared to
releasing a new Microsoft Xbox title in addition to
having sales of carryover titles in 2002. New releases typically
generate higher unit sales resulting in higher overall sales as
compared to carryover titles. Profit from the joint venture
contributed significantly to our pre-tax profit, representing
176% of pre-tax income in 2001 and 195% in 2002.
19 Table of Contents Interest, Net. Interest income decreased in 2002 compared
to 2001 in spite of higher average cash balances due to lower
interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes
included Federal, state and foreign income taxes in 2001 and
2002, at effective tax rates of 26% in 2001 and 22% in 2002,
benefiting from a flat 165% Hong Kong Corporation Tax on our
income arising in, or derived from, Hong Kong. The decrease in
the current year effective rate net results primarily from
certain permanently non-taxable items in addition to a continued
shift in profits to more favorable tax jurisdictions. Quarterly Fluctuations and Seasonality We have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in
operating results and anticipate these fluctuations in the
future. The operating results for any quarter are not
necessarily indicative of results for any future period. Our
first quarter is typically expected to be the least profitable
as a result of lower net sales but substantially similar fixed
operating expenses. This is consistent with the performance of
many companies in the toy industry. The following table presents our unaudited quarterly results for
the years indicated. The seasonality of our business is
reflected in this quarterly presentation.

During the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a charge of
$50million to bad debt impacting operating income
relating to the bankruptcy filing of one of our customers, Kmart. During the first quarter of 2002, we recorded a charge which
impacted operating income by approximately $66million
relating to the restructuring of Toymax and Kidz Biz. During the second quarter of 2002, we recorded a charge which
impacted operating income by approximately $15million
relating to the recall of one of our products. During the fourth quarter of 2002, we reversed $21million
of the restructuring charge recorded in the first quarter of
2002 and recorded an additional charge of approximately $07
million relating to the recall of one of our products, the net
of which favorably impacted operating income by approximately
$14 million. In addition, our effective tax rate for the year
2002 was reduced from 26% to 22%. During the second quarter of 2003, we recorded a charge which
impacted operating income by approximately $27million
relating to the recall of one of our products.
20 Table of Contents During the third quarter of 2003, we recovered $07million
of the recall costs, recorded in the second quarter of 2003,
from one of our factories. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a non-cash charge
of $84million which impacted operating income relating to
the grant of restricted stock and a charge of $21million
to bad debt impacting operating income relating to the
bankruptcy filing of several of our customers, including Kay
BeeToys. Recent Accounting Standards In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations SFAS143. The objective of
SFAS143 is to establish an accounting standard for the
recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation on
certain long-lived assets. The retirement obligation must be one
that results from the acquisition, construction or normal
operation of a long-lived asset. SFAS143 requires the
legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible
long-lived asset to be recognized at fair value as a liability
when incurred, and the cost to be capitalized by increasing the
carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. SFAS143
was adopted effective January1, 2003 and the adoption of
this statement had no material impact on the consolidated
financial statements. In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No145, Rescission of Statements
No4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No13,
and Technical Correction SFAS145.
SFAS145 eliminates extraordinary accounting treatment for
reporting gains or losses on debt extinguishments, and amends
other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various
technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their
applicability under changed conditions. SFAS145 was
adopted effective January1, 2003 and the adoption of this
statement had no material impact on the consolidated financial
statements. In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No146, Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities
SFAS146, which changes the accounting for
costs such as lease termination costs and certain employee
severance costs that are associated with a restructuring,
discontinued operation, plant closing, or other exit or disposal
activity initiated after December31, 2002. The standard
requires companies to recognize the fair value of costs
associated with exit or disposal activities when they are
incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or
disposal plan. The adoption of SFAS146 had no material
effect on the Companys financial position or results of
operations. In November2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
No45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others Interpretation 45,
which addresses the accounting for and disclosure of guarantees.
Interpretation 45 requires a guarantor to recognize a liability
for the fair value of a guarantee at inception. The recognition
of the liability is required even if it is not probable that
payments will be required under the guarantee. The disclosure
requirements are effective for interim and annual financial
statements ending after December15, 2002. The initial
recognition and measurement provisions are effective for all
guarantees within the scope of Interpretation 45 issued or
modified after December31, 2002. The application of
Interpretation 45 did not have a material effect on the
Companys financial position or results of operations. In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and
Equity SFAS 150. SFAS 150 establishes
standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain
21 Table of Contents financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities
and equity. The provisions of SFAS150 were adopted
effective June9, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 150 did not
have a material effect on the Companys financial position
or results of operations. In January2003 and as revised in December 2003, FASB
issued FASB Interpretation No46, Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities Interpretation 46
and FASB Interpretation No. 46R. Interpretation 46 and 46R
require companies with a variable interest in a variable
interest entity to apply this guidance as of the beginning of
the first reporting period after December15, 2003. The
application of the guidance could result in the consolidation of
a variable interest entity. The Company anticipates that the
adoption of Interpretation 46 and 46R will not have a material
effect on the Companys financial position or results of
operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December31, 2003, we had working capital of
$2326million, as compared to $1292million as of
December31, 2002. This increase was primarily attributable
to the receipt of net proceeds from the issuance of our
convertible notes payable and from operating activities offset
in part by disbursements relating to the acquisition of certain
assets of PM. Operating activities provided net cash of $72million in
the year ended December31, 2003 as compared to
$662million, including cash provided from the sale of
marketable securities of $371million, in 2002. Net cash
was provided primarily by net income and non-cash charges, such
as the grant of restricted stock and depreciation and
amortization, as well as increases in accounts payable and
deferred income taxes, which were offset in part by an increase
in accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses and other
and decreases in accrued expenses, income taxes payable, and
reserve for sales returns and allowances. As of
December31, 2003, we had cash and cash equivalents of
$1182million and marketable securities of
$193million. Our investing activities used cash of $475million in the
year ended December31, 2003, as compared to
$878million in 2002, consisting primarily of the purchase
of office furniture and equipment and molds and tooling used in
the manufacture of our products, the purchase of other assets,
the goodwill acquired in the acquisition of PM and the
purchase of marketable securities, partially offset by the
repayment of notes receivable from officers. In 2002, our
investing activities consisted primarily of the purchase of
molds and tooling used in the manufacture of our products, the
goodwill acquired in the acquisitions of Toymax and
Trendmasters, plus the $45million in goodwill relating to
the final earn-out for Flying Colors, partially offset by the
repayment of notes receivable from officers. As part of our
strategy to develop and market new products, we have entered
into various character and product licenses with royalties
ranging from 1% to 18% payable on net sales of such products. As
of December31, 2003, these agreements required future
aggregate minimum guarantees of $219million, exclusive of
$48million in advances already paid. Our financing activities provided net cash of $900million
in the year ended December31, 2003, as compared to
$649million in 2002. In 2003, cash was primarily provided
from the sale of our convertible senior notes and from the
exercise of stock options, partially offset by the repurchase of
our common stock and the repayment of long-term debt. In 2002,
cash was primarily provided from the sale of our common stock
and from the exercise of stock options and warrants, partially
offset by the repayment of debt.

In December 2001, we acquired all of the outstanding capital
stock of Kidz Biz Limited, a United Kingdom company, and an
affiliated Hong Kong company, Kidz Biz Far East Limited, for an
aggregate purchase price of approximately $124million.
Total consideration was paid on the closing of the transaction
in cash in the amount of $64million and the issuance of
308,992shares of our common stock at a value of
$60million. In addition, we agreed to pay an earn-out for
each of 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, based on the year over year
increase in Kidz Biz sales, payable by delivery of up to 25,749
shares of our common stock per year. In 2002 and 2003, no
earn-outs were earned. In October 2001, we and all of our domestic subsidiaries jointly
and severally secured a syndicated line of credit totaling
$500million with a consortium of banks led by Bank of
America, N.A. Line of Credit. On June3,
2003, we and the banks amended the loan agreements governing the
Line of Credit the Loan Agreements, pursuant to
which amendment ithe banks suspended certain of our
covenants under the Loan Agreements, including those that
prohibited us from consummating the Convertible Senior Notes
offering note8 without the banks consent, and
iithe banks obligations to extend credit under the
Line of Credit were simultaneously suspended. The amendment
contemplates that we and the banks will attempt to negotiate
revised terms for the Line of Credit, to be reflected in a
further amendment to the Loan Agreements, while waiving the
requirement for obtaining consent for this offering. Neither we
nor the banks, however, have any obligation to enter into such
further amendment to the Loan Agreements. The amendment did not
otherwise effect our right under the Loan Agreements to
voluntarily reduce or terminate the Line of Credit. There have
never been any outstanding borrowings under the Line of Credit
since its inception. In February 2003, our Board of Directors approved a buyback of
up to $20million of our common stock. As of
December31, 2003, we repurchased and retired
554,500shares of our common stock for a total of
approximately $61million. On May31, 2003, we purchased certain product lines,
related assets and assumed certain liabilities of PM. The
total purchase price of approximately $220million
consisted of cash paid in the amount of $207million and
liabilities of $13million and resulted in goodwill of
$168million. Results of operations have included PM
from the date of acquisition. Pursuant to the terms of a Purchase Agreement, dated
June9, 2003, we sold an aggregate of $98million of
4625% Convertible Senior Notes due June15, 2023. The
holders of the notes may convert the notes into shares of our
common stock at any time at an initial conversion price of
$2000per share, subject to certain circumstances
described in the notes. We will pay cash interest on the notes
at an annual rate of 4625% of the principal amount at issuance,
from the issue date to June15, 2010, payable on
June15 and December15 of each year, commencing on
December15, 2003. After June15, 2010, we will not
pay cash interest on the notes. At maturity, on June15 23 Table of Contents 2023, we will redeem the notes at their accreted principal
amount, which will be equal to $1,81195 181195% per
$1,000principal amount at issuance. We may redeem the notes at our option in whole or in part
beginning on June15, 2010, at 100% of their accreted
principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest including
contingent interest and additional amounts, if any, payable in
cash. Holders of the notes may also require us to repurchase all
or part of their notes on June15, 2010, for cash, at a
repurchase price of 100% of the principal amount per note plus
accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest and
additional amounts, if any. Holders of the notes may also
require us to repurchase all or part of their notes on
June15, 2013 and June15, 2018 at a repurchase price
of 100% of the accreted principal amount per note plus accrued
and unpaid interest including contingent interest and
additional amounts, if any. Any repurchases at June15,
2013 and June15, 2018 may be paid in cash, in shares of
common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. We believe that our cash flows from operations, cash and cash
equivalents on hand and marketable securities will be sufficient
to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements
and provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our anticipated
operating needs for at least the next 12months. Although
operating activities are expected to provide cash, to the extent
we grow significantly in the future, our operating and investing
activities may use cash and, consequently, this growth may
require us to obtain additional sources of financing. There can
be no assurance that any necessary additional financing will be
available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Exchange Rates Sales from our United States and Hong Kong operations are
denominated in U.S. dollars and our manufacturing costs are
denominated in either U.S. or Hong Kong dollars. Domestic sales
from our United Kingdom operations and operating expenses of all
of our operations are denominated in local currency, thereby
creating exposure to changes in exchange rates. Changes in the
Hong Kong dollar or British Pound/U.S. dollar exchange rate may
positively or negatively affect our gross margins, operating
income and retained earnings. The exchange rate of the Hong Kong
dollar to the U.S. dollar has been fixed by the Hong Kong
government since 1983 at HK$780 to US$100 and, accordingly,
has not represented a currency exchange risk to the U.S. dollar.
We cannot assure you that the exchange rate between the United
States and Hong Kong currencies will continue to be fixed or
that exchange rate fluctuations between the United States and
Hong Kong and United Kingdom currencies will not have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results
of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows due to
adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and
rates. We are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in
United States and international borrowing rates and changes in
foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, we are exposed to
market risk in certain geographic areas that have experienced or
remain vulnerable to an economic downturn, such as China. We
purchase substantially all of our inventory from companies in
China, and, therefore, we are subject to the risk that such
suppliers will be unable to provide inventory at competitive
prices. While we believe that, if such an event were to occur we
would be able to find alternative sources of inventory at
competitive prices, we cannot assure you that we would be able
to do so. These exposures are directly related to our normal
operating and funding activities.
24 Table of Contents Historically and as of December31, 2003, we have not used
derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities to
minimize our market risk. Interest Rate Risk As of December 31, 2003, we do not have any outstanding balances
on our Line of Credit. On June9, 2003, we issued
convertible notes payable of $980million with a fixed
interest rate of 4625% per annum. Accordingly, we are not
generally subject to any direct risk of loss arising from
changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Risk We have wholly-owned subsidiaries in HongKong and in the
United Kingdom. Sales by these operations made on a FOB China or
HongKong basis are denominated in U.S.dollars.
However, purchases of inventory and HongKong operating
expenses are typically denominated in HongKong dollars and
domestic sales and operating expenses made in the United Kingdom
are typically denominated in British Pounds, thereby creating
exposure to changes in exchange rates. Changes in the British
Pound or HongKong dollar/ U.S.dollar exchange rates
may positively or negatively affect our gross margins, operating
income and retained earnings. The British Pound gave rise to the
other comprehensive loss in the balance sheet at
December31, 2003. The exchange rate of the HongKong
dollar to the U.S.dollar has been fixed by the
HongKong government since 1983 at HK$780 to US$100 and,
accordingly, has not represented a currency exchange risk to the
U.S.dollar. We do not believe that near-term changes in
these exchange rates, if any, will result in a material effect
on our future earnings, fair values or cash flows, and
therefore, we have chosen not to enter into foreign currency
hedging transactions. We cannot assure you that this approach
will be successful, especially in the event of a significant and
sudden change in the value of the HongKong dollar or
British Pound.
25 Table of Contents Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT The Stockholders JAKKS Pacific, Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
JAKKS Pacific, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December31,
2002 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, other comprehensive income, stockholders
equity and cash flows and the financial statement schedule for
each of the three years in the period ended December31,
2003. These financial statements and the financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and the financial statement schedule based
on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and
schedule referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of JAKKS Pacific, Inc. and
Subsidiaries as of December31, 2002 and 2003, and the
results of their operations and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December31, 2003, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

31 Table of Contents JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS DECEMBER31, 2003 Note 1Principal industry JAKKS Pacific, Inc. the Company is engaged in the
development, production and marketing of toys and related
products, some of which are based on highly-recognized
entertainment properties and character licenses. The Company
commenced its primary business operations in July 1995 through
the purchase of substantially all of the assets of a Hong Kong
toy company. The Company markets its product lines domestically
and internationally. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Delaware in January 1995. Note 2Summary of significant accounting policies Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. In consolidation, all
significant inter-company balances and transactions are
eliminated. Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid assets, having an
original maturity of less than three months, to be cash
equivalents. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposits
which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The
Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The
Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit
risk on cash and cash equivalents. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual future results
could differ from those estimates. Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized upon the shipment of goods to customers.
Provisions for estimated returns, defective products and other
allowances are made at the time of sale. Inventory Inventory, which includes the ex-factory cost of goods and
in-bound freight, is valued at the lower of cost first-in,
first-out or market and consists of the following

Continued DECEMBER31, 2003 Marketable securities Marketable securities categorized as trading securities were
liquidated at December31, 2002 and related unrealized
holding gains or losses are included in earnings. New
investments made in 2003 are categorized as available for sale
and related unrealized holding gains or losses are included as a
component of stockholders equity. At December31,
2002 and 2003, cost approximated fair market value. Fair value of financial instruments The Companys cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable and loan payable represent financial instruments. The
carrying value of these financial instruments is a reasonable
approximation of fair value. The fair value of the convertible
senior notes, at December31, 2003 was approximately
$990million. The fair value of the Companys
convertible senior notes approximates the carrying value based
on quoted trading prices for the notes. Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and are being
depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated
useful lives as follows   
Office equipment

Shipping and handling costs The consolidated financial statements reflect, for all periods
presented, the adoption of the classification or disclosure
requirements pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF 00-10, Accounting for Shipping and
Handling Fees and Costs, which was effective in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2000. Consistent with EITF 00-10, the Company
has historically classified income from freight charges to
customers in Net sales. The Company classifies
shipping and handling costs in Selling, general and
administrative expenses. Such costs amounted to
approximately $119million in 2001, $81million in
2002 and $52million in 2003. Advertising Production costs of commercials and programming are charged to
operations in the year during which the production is first
aired. The costs of other advertising, promotion and marketing
programs are charged to operations in the year incurred.
Advertising expense for the years ended December31, 2001,
2002 and 2003, was approximately $110million 127million and 124million, respectively. Income taxes The Company does not file a consolidated return with its foreign
subsidiaries. The Company files Federal and state returns and
its foreign subsidiaries each file Hong Kong returns and United
Kingdom returns, as applicable. Deferred taxes are provided on a
liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized as
deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax
credit

Continued DECEMBER31, 2003 carry-forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for
taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the
differences between the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced
by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it
is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws
and rates on the date of enactment. Translation of foreign currencies Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Hong Kong dollars
or British Pounds Sterling are translated into United States
dollars at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet
date. Transactions during the period are translated at the rates
ruling at the dates of the transactions. Profits and losses resulting from the above translation policy
are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and
statements of other comprehensive income. Accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets Long-lived assets, which include property and equipment,
goodwill and intangible assets other than goodwill, are
evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be
recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows
from the use of these assets. When any such impairment exists,
the related assets will be written down to fair value. Goodwill and other intangible assets In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No141, Business Combinations
SFAS141 and Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets SFAS142.
SFAS141 is effective for business combinations initiated
after June30, 2001. SFAS141 requires that all
business combinations completed after its adoption be accounted
for under the purchase method of accounting and establishes
specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets
separately from goodwill. SFAS142 was effective for the
Company on January1, 2002 and primarily addresses the
accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to
their acquisition. With the adoption of SFAS142, goodwill
and other intangible assets are no longer amortized and are
tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit
level. As of December31, 2003, there was no impairment to
the underlying value of goodwill or intangible assets other than
goodwill.

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair
market value of the assets of acquired companies. In fiscal
2002, the Company began to write off goodwill and certain
intangible assets on an impairment basis where losses in value
are recorded when and as material impairment has occurred in the
underlying assets. Accumulated amortization of goodwill at
December31, 2002 and 2003 totaled $66million. The carrying value of goodwill is based on managements
current assessment of recoverability. Management evaluates
recoverability using both objective and subjective factors.
Objective factors include managements best estimates of
projected future earnings and cash flows and analysis of recent
sales and earnings trends. Subjective factors include
competitive analysis and the Companys strategic focus. Intangible assets other than goodwill consist of product
technology rights and trademarks. Intangible assets are
amortized on a straight-line basis, over five to thirty years,
the estimated economic lives of the related assets. Accumulated
amortization as of December31, 2002 and 2003 was
$29million and $30million, respectively. Stock Option Plans In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No148 Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure
an Amendment of FASB Statement No123
SFAS148. SFAS148 Statement amends
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS123, to provide alternative methods of
transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair
value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. It also amends the disclosure provisions of that
Statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects on
reported net income of an entitys accounting policy
decisions with respect to stock-based employee
35 Table of Contents JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued DECEMBER31, 2003 compensation. Finally, SFAS148 amends APB Opinion
No28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require disclosure
about those effects in interim financial information. At December31, 2003, the Company has stock-based employee
compensation plans, which are described more fully in
Note14. The Company accounts for those plans under the
recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
related Interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation
cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under
those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of
the underlying common stock on the date of grant. However,
certain options had been repriced resulting in compensation
adjustments, which have been reflected in net income. The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and
earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS123, to stock-based employee
compensation. In 2001, 2002 and 2003 the fair value of each employee option
grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions used:
risk-free rate of interest of 6%, 4% and 4%, respectively;
dividend yield of 0%; with volatility of 91%, 87% and 82%
respectively; and expected lives of five years.

Recent Accounting
Standards In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations SFAS143. The objective of
SFAS143 is to
37 Table of Contents JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued DECEMBER31, 2003 establish an accounting standard for the recognition and
measurement of an asset retirement obligation on certain
long-lived assets. The retirement obligation must be one that
results from the acquisition, construction or normal operation
of a long-lived asset. SFAS143 requires the legal
obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible
long-lived asset to be recognized at fair value as a liability
when incurred, and the cost to be capitalized by increasing the
carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. SFAS143
was adopted effective January1, 2003 and the adoption of
this statement had no material impact on the consolidated
financial statements. In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No145, Rescission of Statements
No4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No13,
and Technical Correction SFAS145.
SFAS145 eliminates extraordinary accounting treatment for
reporting gains or losses on debt extinguishments, and amends
other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various
technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their
applicability under changed conditions. SFAS145 was
adopted effective January1, 2003 and the adoption of this
statement had no material impact on the consolidated financial
statements. In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No146, Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities
SFAS146, which changes the accounting for
costs such as lease termination costs and certain employee
severance costs that are associated with a restructuring,
discontinued operation, plant closing, or other exit or disposal
activity initiated after December31, 2002. The standard
requires companies to recognize the fair value of costs
associated with exit or disposal activities when they are
incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or
disposal plan. The adoption of SFAS146 had no material
effect on the Companys financial position or results of
operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
No45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others
Interpretation45, which addresses the
accounting for and disclosure of guarantees.
Interpretation45 requires a guarantor to recognize a
liability for the fair value of a guarantee at inception. The
recognition of the liability is required even if it is not
probable that payments will be required under the guarantee. The
disclosure requirements are effective for interim and annual
financial statements ending after December15, 2002. The
initial recognition and measurement provisions are effective for
all guarantees within the scope of Interpretation45 issued
or modified after December31, 2002. The application of
Interpretation45 did not have a material effect on the
Companys financial position or results of operations. In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No150, Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and
Equity SFAS150. SFAS150
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures
certain financial instruments with characteristics of both
liabilities and equity. The provisions of SFAS150 were
adopted effective June9, 2003. The adoption of
SFAS150 did not have a material effect on the
Companys financial position or results of operations. In January 2003 and as revised in December 2003, FASB issued
FASB Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities Interpretation46 and
FASB Interpretation No. 46R. Interpretation46 and 46R
require companies with a variable interest in a variable
interest entity to apply this guidance as of the beginning of
the first reporting period after December15 38 Table of Contents JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued DECEMBER31, 2003 2003. The application of the guidance could result in the
consolidation of a variable interest entity. The Company
anticipates that the adoption of Interpretation46 and 46R
will not have a material effect on the Companys financial
position or results of operations. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years balances
in order to conform to the current year presentation. Note 3Business Segments and Geographic Data JAKKS Pacific, Inc. is a worldwide producer and marketer of

Note4 Acquisitions and Joint Venture The Company owns a fifty percent interest in a joint venture
with a company that develops, publishes and distributes
interactive entertainment software for the leading hardware game
platforms in the home video game market. The joint venture has
entered into a license agreement with an initial license period
expiring December31, 2009 under which it acquired the
exclusive worldwide right to publish video games on all hardware
platforms. The Companys investment is accounted for using
the cost method due to the financial and operating structure of
the venture and our lack of
40 Table of Contents JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued DECEMBER31, 2003 control over the joint venture. The Companys basis
consists primarily of organizational costs, license costs and
recoupable advances and is being amortized over the term of the
initial license period. The joint venture agreement provides for
the Company to receive guaranteed preferred returns through
June30, 2006 at varying rates of the joint ventures
net sales depending on the cumulative unit sales and platform of
each particular game. For periods after June30, 2006, the
amount of the preferred return will be subject to renegotiation
between the parties. The preferred return is accrued in the
quarter in which the licensed games are sold and the preferred
return is earned. The Companys joint venture partner
retains the financial risk of the joint venture and is
responsible for the day-to-day operations, including
development, sales and distribution, for which they are entitled
to any remaining profits. During 2001, 2002 and 2003, the
Company earned $67million, $80million and
$74million, respectively, in profit from the joint
venture. In December2001, the Company acquired all the outstanding
stock of Kidz Biz Ltd., a United Kingdom company, and Kidz Biz
Far East Limited, an affiliated Hong Kong corporation,
collectively KidzBiz, for an aggregate
purchase price of approximately $124million, which was
paid by the issuance of 308,992 shares of the Companys
common stock at a value of $60million and cash of
$64million. In addition, we agreed to pay an earn-out for
each of 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, based on the year over year
increase in Kidz Biz sales, payable by delivery of up to
25,749shares of our common stock per year. In 2002 and
2003, no earn-outs were earned. Both the United Kingdom and Hong
Kong based companies are distributors of toys and related
products in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the Channel Islands. The Company acquired the following entities to further enhance
its existing product lines and to continue diversification into
other seasonal businesses. In March 2002, the Company purchased a controlling interest in
Toymax International, Inc. Toymax and on
October25, 2002, the Company completed that acquisition by
acquiring the remaining outstanding common shares in a merger
transaction. The total purchase price of approximately
$628million consisted of 1,166,360 shares of the
Companys common stock, 598,697 options and approximately
$410million in cash. Results of operations have included
Toymax from March12, 2002; however, for the period from
March12, 2002 through October25, 2002, the minority
interests share of Toymaxs earnings were excluded. In November 2002, the Company purchased certain product lines,
assets and assumed certain specific liabilities from
Trendmasters, Inc. Trendmasters. The total
purchase price of approximately $192million consisted of
all cash. Results of operations have included Trendmasters from
the date of acquisition. On May31, 2003, the Company purchased certain product
lines, assets and assumed certain liabilities of
PMProducts USA, Inc. and an affiliated United Kingdom
company, PMProducts Limited collectively
PM. The total purchase price of approximately
$220million consisted of $207million in cash and
$13million in liabilities. Results of operations have
included PM from the date of acquisition.

Deferred taxes result from temporary differences between tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in
the consolidated financial statements. The temporary differences
result from costs required to be capitalized for tax purposes by
the U.S.Internal Revenue Code IRC, and
certain items accrued for financial reporting purposes in the
year incurred but not deductible for tax purposes until paid. As of December31, 2003, the Company has federal and state
net operating loss carryforwards of $204million and
$389million, respectively, expiring through 2023. These
carryforwards resulted from the acquisitions of Pentech and
Toymax; the utilization of these losses to offset future income
is limited under IRC382. The Companys management
concluded that a deferred tax asset valuation allowance was not
necessary.

Note 10Credit Facility In October2001, the Company and all of its subsidiaries
jointly and severally secured a syndicated line of credit
totaling $500million with a consortium of banks led by
Bank of America, N.A. Line of Credit. On
June3, 2003, the Company and the banks amended the loan
agreements governing the Line of Credit the Loan
Agreements, pursuant to which amendment ithe
banks suspended certain of our covenants under the Loan
Agreements, including those that prohibited the Company from
consummating the Convertible Senior Notes offering note8
without the banks consent, and iithe banks
obligations to extend credit under the Line of Credit were
simultaneously suspended. The amendment contemplates that the
Company and the banks will attempt to negotiate revised terms
for the Line of Credit, to be reflected in a further amendment
to the Loan Agreements, while waiving the requirement for
obtaining consent for this offering. Neither the Company nor the
banks, however, have any obligation to enter into such further
amendment to the Loan Agreements. The amendment did not
otherwise effect the Companys right under the Loan
Agreements to voluntarily reduce or terminate the Line of
Credit. There have never been any outstanding borrowings under
the Line of Credit since its inception. Note 11Leases The Company leases office, warehouse and showroom facilities and
certain equipment under operating leases. Rent expense for the
three years ended December31, 2003 totaled
$25million, $40million and $52million,
