ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
The following financial statements are filed herewith and are listed under
Item 14 of Part IV of this report.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Board of Directors of VitalCom Inc.,
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of VitalCom Inc. the
Company as of December 31, 1996 and 1997, and the related statements of
operations, stockholders' equity deficit and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1997. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in Item 14a. These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of VitalCom Inc. at December 31, 1996 and 1997,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
General and Nature of Operations -- VitalCom provides radio communications
products and computer networks that acquire, interpret and distribute real-time
patient monitoring information. The Company radio and computer networks
acquire physiologic data generated by its own proprietary ECG monitors and other
manufacturers' bedside equipment located throughout a healthcare facility. The
Company products are sold through a direct sales force to acute care hospitals
and integrated healthcare delivery networks IHDNs and on an Original
Equipment Manufacturer OEM basis to patient monitoring equipment
manufacturers.
During the 1994 year, New PCI, Inc. changed its name to ACCUCORE, Inc., and
in January 1996, changed its name to VitalCom Inc. the Company.
Consolidation -- In December 1995, the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiary merged. The merger has been treated as a reorganization of entities
under common control and accounted for in a manner similar to that of a pooling
of interests. The Company financial statements have been restated accordingly.
Cash Equivalents -- Cash equivalents generally represent highly liquid
investments purchased with an original maturity date of three months or less.
Short-Term Investments -- The Company accounts for investments in debt and
equity securities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 115 SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities. SFAS 115 requires investment securities to be classified as trading,
available for sale, or held to maturity. Management determines the appropriate
classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the
classification at each balance sheet date. As of December 31, 1997, all
investments in the short-term investment portfolio are classified as available
for sale. Investments classified as available for sale are required to be
recorded at fair value and any temporary difference between an investment cost
and its fair value is recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity.
Inventories -- Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost
or market.
Property -- Property is stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using the
straight-line method and the double declining balance method over the estimated
useful lives of the related assets, generally three to eight years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the
related improvements or the related lease term.
Goodwill -- Goodwill represents the excess purchase cost over the net
assets acquired and is amortized over 20 years using the straight-line method.
The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of goodwill based on a
profitability analysis related to its product sales and has determined that
there was no impairment of goodwill at December 31, 1997.
Long Lived Assets -- The Company accounts for the impairment and
disposition of long-lived assets in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121 SFAS 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. In accordance
with SFAS 121, long-lived assets to be held are reviewed for events or changes
in circumstances which indicate that their carrying value may not be
recoverable. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of long-lived
assets to determine whether or not an impairment to such value has occurred and
has determined that there was no impairment at December 31, 1997.
Revenue Recognition -- Revenues from both Networked MonitoringTM systems
and OEM products, which consist of both hardware and software, are recognized
upon shipment if no significant vendor obligations remain and collection of the
related receivable is probable. The Company accounts for insignificant vendor
obligations and post-contract support at the time of product delivery by
accruing such costs and recognizing them ratably on completion of performance.
There is no right of return on sales. Revenues related to service
27
29
VITALCOM INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
contracts with customers, which are insignificant, are deferred and amortized
over the terms of the contracts, generally one year.
Software Development Costs -- Development costs incurred in the research
and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software
products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been
established. After technological feasibility is established, any additional
costs would be capitalized in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold,
Leased or Otherwise Marketed. Because the Company believes that its current
process for developing software is essentially completed concurrently with the
establishment of technological feasibility, no costs are capitalized as of
December 31, 1995, 1996 or 1997.
Income Taxes -- The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109 SFAS No. 109, Accounting
for Income Taxes. This statement requires the recognition of deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the future consequences of events that have been recognized
in the Company financial statements or tax returns. Measurement of the
deferred items is based on enacted tax laws.
Net Income loss Per Share -- Net income loss per share is computed by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common and common
equivalent shares outstanding. Weighted average common and common equivalent
shares include common shares, stock options using the treasury stock method and
the assumed conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock into shares
of common stock. In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 SFAS 128,
Earnings Per Share, which the Company was required to adopt in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1997. Under the provisions of SFAS 128, primary earnings per
share is replaced by basic earnings per share and the dilutive effect of stock
options will be excluded from the calculation.
Net Income Applicable to Common Stockholders -- Net income applicable to
common stockholders represents net income less preferred dividends and accretion
attributable to preferred stock redemption value See Note 5 of Notes to
Financial Statements.
Stock Split -- In connection with the June 1, 1995 transactions discussed
in Note 5, common stockholders received an additional 409,197 shares of common
stock due to a 1612 for 1 common stock split. Per share amounts reflect such
stock split.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements -- In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard No. 130 SFAS 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, and No. 131 SFAS 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information. These statements are effective for fiscal years commencing
after December 15, 1997. While the Company is required to comply with the
provisions of these statements in fiscal 1998, it has been determined that the
effect that these new standards will have on its consolidated financial
statements and disclosures is not material.
In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, which supercedes SOP 91-1. The
provisions of SOP 97-2 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 1997. The Company is reviewing the impact of the statement on its financial
statements.
Use of Estimates -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles necessarily requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Significant Concentrations
Customer Concentrations -- The Company OEM revenues, which represented
556% and 537% of the Company total revenues in 1996 and 1997 respectively,
have historically been concentrated in a small number of OEM customers.
Approximately 304%, 417% and 456% of 1995, 1996 and 1997 total revenues,
respectively, were to three customers. The loss of, or a reduction in sales to,
any such OEM customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company
business, operating results and financial condition. Further, sales of the
Company OEM products are dependent to a large extent upon the Company OEM
customers selling patient monitoring devices that include the Company OEM
products as necessary components. Any inability of such OEM customers to sell
such systems, or any election by such OEM customers not to include the Company
products as components therein, could have a material adverse effect on the
Company business, operating results and financial condition.
Supplier Concentration -- Certain of the Company products utilize
components that are available in the short term only from a single or a limited
number of sources. Certain of these components, such as semiconductor devices,
have been available only on an allocation basis in the past and could be in
scarce supply again in the future. Any inability to obtain components in the
amounts needed on a timely basis or at commercially reasonable prices could
result in delays in product introductions or interruption in product shipments
or increases in product costs, which could have a material adverse effect on the
Company business, operating results and financial condition until alternative
sources could be developed or design and manufacturing changes could be
completed. Any such design or manufacturing changes or increased costs could
result in delayed shipments and significant expenses in a particular quarter and
therefore could materially adversely affect operating results for any such
quarter or other period.
Reclassifications -- Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1995
and 1996 financial statements to conform to the 1997 presentation.
2. INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market and
consists of the following at December 31:

Finished goods.  1,387,897    577,063
$3,191,043  $1,812,499
3. REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT
In August 1997, the Company entered into a secured lending arrangement the
Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, providing for a $50 million revolving
line of credit bearing interest at the bank prime rate. The bank does not have
security interest in any of the Company assets unless the Company is borrowing
under the line of credit and fails to comply with certain financial covenants.
The Agreement expires in August 1998 and has certain financial and other
covenants. The financial covenants required are that the Company maintain a
quick assets ratio of not less than 2 to 1, maintain tangible net worth of not
less than $20,000,000, maintain a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net
worth of not more than 1 to 1 and maintain an aggregate total of cash and
marketable securities in an amount at least equal to the product of two times
the maximum amount of the Credit Line. At December 31, 1997, there were no
borrowings outstanding under the Agreement and the Company was in compliance
with all covenants. As such, the bank held no security interest in any of the
Company assets.

5. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
On June 1, 1995 in a series of transactions, certain stockholders, who
owned approximately 73% of the Company, sold 3,143,097 shares of Series A and B
common stock and 7,618,392 shares of Series A and Series B preferred to new
investors who exchanged those shares for 3,982,568 shares of newly issued Series
C and Series D preferred stock. In connection with the transactions, the Company
repurchased 1,233,136 shares of its Series B common stock for $123,314 and a
stockholder contributed 15,544 shares of Series A common stock to the Company.
Such shares of common stock were subsequently retired by the Company. Holders of
the remaining shares of Series A common stock, which represented approximately
27% of the Company ownership including shares received in the stock split
described in Note 1, then exchanged their common shares for newly issued shares
of common stock. No change in accounting basis was made as a result of this
transaction. During the year ended December 31, 1995, $516,840 and $191,160 was
accreted towards the Series C and Series D liquidation preference respectively,
using the effective interest method.
In connection with these transactions, the Company, the new stockholders
and the other stockholders of the Company entered into a Stockholders Agreement
the Stockholders Agreement providing for, among other things, certain
restrictions on the transfer of shares of common stock or preferred stock,
rights of first refusal, and certain rights with respect to the repurchase of
such shares by the Company in the event of the death or total disability of the
holder thereof. Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, the new stockholders and
the other stockholders agree to vote their respective shares in a certain manner
in connection with the election of directors, including the directors elected
solely by the holders of the Series C convertible preferred stock. The
Stockholders Agreement terminated automatically upon the effective date of the
Company initial public offering.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
The Series C preferred stockholders were entitled to receive dividends if
and when declared by the Board of Directors, were entitled to one vote for each
share of preferred stock subject to certain adjustments, had a liquidation
preference of $572 per share, and were convertible into shares of common stock
at the liquidation price per share subject to certain adjustments and were
mandatorily convertible upon an initial public offering of a certain size and
value. Such shares of preferred stock were mandatorily redeemable by the Company
at $572 per share in annual 25% increments beginning in 2001. Effective with
the Company initial public offering in February 1996, each share of the Series
C preferred stock was converted to one share of common stock.
The Series D preferred stockholders were entitled to the same rights and
privileges as the Series C stockholders except that they were not entitled to
vote, and they could convert their shares to Series C preferred shares under
certain circumstances. Such Series D shares were mandatorily convertible
ultimately into common stock upon the Company initial public offering.
Effective with the Company initial public offering in February 1996, each
share of the Series D preferred stock was converted to one share of common
stock.
In October 1995, the Company sold 34,965 shares of common stock and 43,706
shares of Series C preferred stock to its then President and raised net proceeds
of approximately $200,000 and $249,998, respectively, under an agreement entered
into in September 1995. Also during the year ended December 31, 1995, the
Company sold 43,707, 114,054 and 279,301 shares of its common stock, preferred C
and preferred D stock to a certain employee and a shareholder and raised net
proceeds of $230,799, $602,386 and $1,474,808, respectively.
During the year ended December 31, 1996 the Company issued 2,300,000 shares
of common stock in its initial public offering, raising approximately
$25,633,607, net of expenses. Effective with the initial public offering all

shares of Series D preferred stock converted to one share each of the Company
common stock. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 1996 the Company

40,000 shares of its common stock, under interest-bearing, nonrecourse notes in
the amount of $195,000 and received net proceeds of $40 during 1997.
6. 401K AND PROFIT-SHARING PLAN
The Company has a contributory profit-sharing plan which covers
substantially all of its employees. Effective July 1, 1993, the Company amended
its profit-sharing plan to include a 401k provision the 401k Plan. The
401k provisions in the 401k Plan allow eligible employees to contribute up
to 15% of their income on a tax-deferred basis, subject to IRS discrimination
and maximum dollar deferral rules. The Company, at its sole election, may make
matching contributions to the 401k Plan. The Board of Directors approved a
discretionary employer-matching contribution of $50 for each $100 the employee
contributes on the first 12% of compensation deposited as elective
contributions, subject to 401k Plan limitations and IRS regulations, for
calendar years 1995, 1996, and 1997. The Company matching contributions vest
to employees at 25% per year for each full year of continuous service. The
Company 401k matching expense was $228,590, $300,006 and $255,016 for the
years ended December 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively.
The 401k Plan provides for an annual contribution to a self-directed
employee trust in an amount to be determined by the Board of Directors, but
limited to the amount allowable for income tax purposes.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Employees may make annual contributions to the 401k Plan of not more than 10%
of their annual compensation. The Company contributions vest to the employees
at 20% for the first two years and 20% per year for years three through six for
each full year of continuous service, and are allocated based on employee
compensation. The Company had no profit-sharing expense for the years ended
December 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997.
7. STOCK BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
At December 31, 1996 the Company had three stock options plans and an
employee stock purchase plan, which are described below. The Company accounts
for these plans in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
Interpretations APB 25. In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company
has chosen to continue to account for its stock-based compensation plans under
APB 25 and provide the expanded disclosures specified in SFAS 123. No
compensation expense has been recognized for its stock-based compensation plans.
Had compensation cost been determined using the provisions of SFAS 123, the
Company net income loss and income loss per share would have been:
1995     1996     1997
Net loss. As reported  $1,583,250  $6,367,839 $4,649,865
Pro forma  $1,562,350  6,567,038  5,109,243
Net loss per basic share.           030     090    058
Net loss per diluted
share.           028     090    058
For purposes of estimating the compensation cost of the Company option
grants and employee stock purchase plan in accordance with SFAS 123, the fair
value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions used for
grants in the years 1997 and 1996, respectively: expected volatility of 52% and
67%; risk free interest rate of 6%; and expected lives of 10 years for the 1993
Stock Option Plan and the 1996 Stock Option Plan.
Effective September 22, 1993, the Company adopted the 1993 Stock Option
Plan the Option Plan, as amended, to permit the Company personnel and
directors of the Company to participate in ownership of the Company. The Option
Plan is administered by a committee consisting of two or more non-employee
directors of the Company. Each option agreement includes a provision requiring
the optionee to consent to the terms of the Agreement. The Option Plan provides
for the grant of incentive stock options under the applicable provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code or nonqualified options. In October 1996 the Board of
Directors approved non-officer employees holding outstanding options to purchase
45,400 Common Shares of the Company at exercise prices equal to or in excess of
$1287 to exchange such options for new options at $600 per share, with the new
options having a vesting schedule that re-started on the date of the new option

The Company has reserved an aggregate of 150,000 shares of Common Stock for
issuance under its 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP. The ESPP was
adopted by the Board of Directors in January 1996 and approved by the Company
stockholders prior to the consummation of the Company initial public offering
in February 1996. The ESPP is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and permits eligible employees of the
Company to purchase Common Stock through payroll deductions of up to 10% of
their compensation provided that no employee may purchase more than $25,000
worth of stock in any calendar year. The ESPP was implemented by an offering
period commencing on February 14, 1996 and ending on the last business day in
the period ending October 31, 1996. Each subsequent offering period an
Offering Period commences on the day following the end of the prior Offering
Period and has a duration of six months. The price of Common Stock purchased
under the ESPP will be 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Common
Stock on the first or last day of each offering period. The ESPP will expire in
the year 2006. In the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997 the Company issued
32,815 and 47,359 shares of Common Stock, respectively under the ESPP for
$153,410 and $191,218, respectively. At December 31, 1997, $45,278 had been
withheld from employee earnings for stock purchases under the ESPP.
For purposes of estimating the compensation cost of employees' rights under
the ESPP in accordance with SFAS 123, the fair value of the purchase rights has
been estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions used
for 1997; expected volatility of 52%; risk free interest rate of 6%; expected
life of six months. The weighted-average fair value of those purchase rights
granted in 1997 was $069.
The Company has reserved an aggregate of 60,000 shares of Common Stock for
issuance under its 1996 Director Option Plan the Director Plan. The Director
Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in February 1996. The Director Plan
provides for the grant of an option to purchase a number of shares of Common
Stock the First Option to be determined by the incumbent Board of Directors
to each non-employee director who first becomes a non-employee director after
the effective date of the Director Plan. Annually, each outside director shall
automatically be granted an option to purchase 4,000 shares a Subsequent
Option, provided he or she is then a non-employee director and, as of such
date, he or she shall have served on the Board for at least the preceding six
months. Each non-employee director will be eligible to receive a Subsequent
Option, regardless of whether such non-employee director was eligible to receive
a First Option. First Options and each Subsequent Option will have a term of ten
years. One-quarter of the shares subject to a First Option will vest one year
after their date of grant and an additional one-quarter will vest at the end of
each year thereafter, provided that the optionee continues to serve as a
director on such dates. Similarly, one-quarter of the shares subject to a
Subsequent Option will vest one year after the date of the option grant and an
additional one-quarter will vest at the end of each year thereafter, provided
that the optionee continues to serve as a director on such date. The exercise
prices of the First Option and each Subsequent Option will be 100% of the fair
market value per share of the Company Common Stock on the date of the grant of
the option. There was no activity in the Director Plan during the year ended
