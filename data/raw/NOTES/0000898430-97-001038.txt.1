REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
The Times Mirror Company
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Times
Mirror Company as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1996. Our audits also included
the financial statement schedule listed in the Index to Financial Statements
and Financial Statement Schedules. These financial statements and schedule are
the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The Times
Mirror Company at December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.
As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, in
1995 the Company changed its method of accounting for the impairment of long-
lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of.

THE TIMES MIRROR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries after elimination of all
significant intercompany transactions and balances. Affiliated companies in
which the Company owns a 20 percent to 50 percent interest are accounted for
by the equity method.
Presentation. Certain amounts in previously issued financial statements have
been reclassified to conform to the 1996 presentation. Financial information
for 1995 and 1994, presented in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, excludes discontinued operations except where noted.
Changes in Accounting Principles. Effective January 1, 1995, the Company
changed its method of accounting for certain contract-related revenues from
the licensing and sale of training programs and related materials. Prior to
1995, revenues were recognized for licensing fees, as well as the sale of
training products and seminars. However, the majority of these contract-
related revenues were recognized as licensing fees on the date a non-
cancelable agreement was signed and a master copy of the training materials
was delivered to the customer. As of January 1, 1995, revenues are recognized
either when the training products are delivered or the seminars presented,
with no revenues recognized for licensing fees. The Company believes that this
provides for consistent accounting treatment among its professional training
companies. The Company recorded a cumulative charge of $7,372,000 $4,511,000
net of taxes as of January 1, 1995. The effect of this change on 1995 net
income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles was not
significant.
Effective January 1, 1995, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting
Standards Board Practice Bulletin 13, Direct Response Advertising and
Probable Future Benefits, which clarified the accounting for direct response
advertising costs. The Company accounting practice prior to 1995 was to
capitalize magazine subscription-related direct response advertising costs to
the extent that such costs did not exceed estimated future revenues from
magazine subscriptions and advertising for the specific direct response
efforts. Under the Practice Bulletin 13 interpretation, future estimated
advertising revenues may not be included in estimating probable future
revenues for purposes of determining whether direct response advertising costs
should be capitalized or expensed. The Company recorded a cumulative charge of
$14,169,000 $8,213,000 net of taxes as of January 1, 1995. The effect of
this change on 1995 net income before cumulative effect of changes in
accounting principles was not significant.
Effective July 1, 1995, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of SFAS 121. Long-lived
assets, such as plant and equipment, identifiable intangibles and goodwill,
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable. As a
result of the adoption of SFAS 121, the Company has changed its methodology
for assessing the recoverability of long-lived assets, including goodwill.
Prior to SFAS 121, the Company recognized the difference between future
undiscounted cash flows and net book value as an impairment loss. Impairment
losses under SFAS 121 are determined based on the difference between fair
value, which would generally approximate estimated future cash flows
discounted at the Company cost of capital, and net book value. An impairment
loss on certain assets, as described in Note 5, was recorded in 1995. Prior
period financial statements were not affected by the adoption of SFAS 121.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of investments that are
readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or
less. Cash equivalents of $91,796,000 and $129,471,000 at December 31, 1996
and 1995, respectively, were primarily commercial paper, money market funds
and repurchase agreements.
Under the Company cash management system, the bank notifies the Company
daily of checks presented for payment against its primary disbursing accounts.
The Company transfers funds from other sources such as

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
short-term investments or commercial paper issuance to cover the checks
presented for payment. This program results in a book cash overdraft in the
primary disbursing accounts as a result of checks outstanding. The book
overdraft, which was reclassified to accounts payable, was $37,897,000 and
$33,009,000 at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
Inventories. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market and are
determined under the first-in, first-out method for books and certain finished
products, and under the last-in, first-out method for newsprint, paper and
certain other inventories.
Property, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are carried on
the basis of cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
Additions, improvements and replacements are capitalized.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives as follows:
15-45 years
Machinery and equipment. 3-20 years
Leasehold improvements. Lesser of useful life or lease term
Goodwill and Other Intangibles. Goodwill recognized in business combinations
accounted for as purchases subsequent to October 31, 1970 $516,689,000 at
December 31, 1996 and $638,292,000 at December 31, 1995 net of accumulated
amortization of $158,506,000 and $167,399,000, respectively is being
amortized primarily over 15 to 40 years, with a weighted average amortization
period of 37 years. Goodwill arising from business combinations consummated
prior to November 1, 1970 is not being amortized because, in the opinion of
management, it has not diminished in value. Goodwill amortization expense
amounted to $23,259,000 for 1996, $25,219,000 for 1995 and $22,330,000 for
1994.
Other intangibles arising in connection with acquisitions are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging
from 2 to 21 years, with a weighted average life of 13 years. Amortization
expense amounted to $14,055,000 for 1996, $20,753,000 for 1995 and $22,387,000
for 1994. Accumulated amortization was $60,309,000 and $95,105,000 at December
31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
The Company assesses on an ongoing basis the recoverability of goodwill,
based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows for the applicable
business compared to net book value. If the future undiscounted cash flow
estimate were less than net book value, net book value would then be reduced
to fair value based on an estimate of discounted cash flow. The Company also
evaluates the amortization periods of assets, including goodwill and other
intangible assets, to determine whether events or circumstances warrant
revised estimates of useful lives.
Deferred Charges. Certain expenses for books and training materials are
capitalized and charged to expense over the estimated product life as the
products are sold. Magazine subscription procurement costs are charged to
expense over the same period as the related revenue is earned.
Derivative Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps and forward interest
rate swaps are used to manage exposure to market risk associated with changes
in interest rates. Interest rate swaps are accounted for on the accrual basis.
Payments made or received are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense
related to the debt. Amounts received in connection with forward swaps and
terminated swaps are amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction in
interest expense over the term of the swaps.
The Company exposure to market risk associated with fluctuations in the
value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may be managed with
foreign currency forward contracts, currency options, currency
32
THE TIMES MIRROR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
swaps or other risk management instruments permitted by the Company internal
policy guidelines. The Company practice over the last few years has been to
enter into forward contracts at the beginning of each year, with maturities
occurring at various times during the year. The gains and losses on the
forward contracts, which have not qualified as accounting hedges, are
recognized currently in earnings.
Put options are used as an alternative to open market purchases in
connection with the Company common stock repurchase program. Forward
purchase contracts for the Company Series B preferred stock are used to
commit holders to make future sales to the Company of shares of its Series B
preferred stock or additional common stock, once the Series B stock is
converted into common shares. See Note 21. These contracts are entered into
based on market conditions as well as other factors. The costs or benefits
derived from these equity-based financial instruments are recorded in equity
on the date of the transaction.
Revenue Recognition. Revenues from certain products sold with the right of
return, principally books, are recognized net of a provision for estimated
returns. Revenues from newspaper and magazine subscriptions and professional
service fee annual subscriptions are deferred as unearned income at the time
of the sale. A pro rata share of the newspaper and magazine subscription price
is included in revenue as products are delivered to subscribers. Professional
service fee annual subscription revenues are recognized on a straight-line
basis over the life of the subscription service.
Earnings Per Share. Primary earnings per share is computed by dividing net
income, less preferred dividend requirements and, for 1995, cash paid in
excess of liquidation value on Series B preferred stock repurchases, by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents
outstanding during the period, except when the common stock equivalents are
antidilutive. The weighted average number of shares used for primary earnings
per share totaled 105,085,000 and 113,797,000 for the years ended December 31,
1996 and 1995, respectively.
Fully diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income, less
preferred dividend requirements for Series A preferred stock and, for 1995,
cash paid in excess of liquidation value for Series B preferred stock
repurchases, by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and
dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding, assuming that the Series B
preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 1996 and 1995 was converted to
common stock on a one-for-one basis on January 1, 1996 and March 1, 1995,
respectively. The weighted average number of shares used for fully diluted
earnings per share is 113,583,000 and 123,001,000 for the years ended December
31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
Stock Options. Employee stock options are accounted for under Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,
which requires the recognition of expense when the option price is less than
the fair value of the stock at the date of grant. The Company awards options
for a fixed number of shares at an option price equal to the fair value at the
date of grant. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any
expense related to employee stock option awards. The Company has adopted the
disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. See Note 13.
Retirement Plans and Postretirement Benefits. The Company has defined
benefit pension plans and various other contributory and noncontributory
retirement plans covering substantially all employees. In general, benefits
under the defined benefit plans are based on years of service and the
employee compensation during the last five years of employment. Effective
January 1, 1996, pension plan benefits for most employees will be limited to
30 years of benefit service beginning January 1, 2006. In determining net
periodic pension expense income, prior service costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over 10 years. The defined benefit plans are generally
funded on a current basis in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974. The majority of the Company employees are covered by
one defined benefit plan. Funding is not expected to be
33
THE TIMES MIRROR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
required for this plan in the near future as this plan is overfunded. An
Employee Stock Ownership Plan ESOP, which was frozen effective January 1,
1995, provides benefits in conjunction with certain defined benefits. The fair
value of ESOP assets is recognized as an offset to required funding.
Postretirement health care benefits provided by the Company are unfunded and
cover certain employees hired before January 1, 1993, or approximately half of
the Company current employees. The various plans have significantly
different provisions for lifetime maximums, retiree cost-sharing, health care
providers, prescription drug coverage and other benefits. Postretirement life
insurance benefits are generally insured by life insurance policies and cover
employees who retired on or before December 31, 1993. Life insurance benefits
vary by plan, ranging from $1,000 to $250,000. Certain employees become
eligible for the postretirement health care benefits if they meet minimum age
and service requirements and retire from full-time, active service.
NOTE 2--ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND WRITEDOWNS
During the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company recognized a gain of
$121,649,000 on the exchange of its college publishing businesses and the sale
of its Spanish language medical book publisher, Doyma Libros, and recorded a
writedown of $16,728,000 for the January 1997 disposal of certain net assets
of CRC Press, Inc. The net gain of $104,921,000 was $32,047,000 after
applicable income taxes, primarily due to permanent differences related to
goodwill. Revenues of these businesses represented approximately 7% and 9% of
consolidated revenues of the Company for the years ended December 31, 1996 and
1995.
On October 15, 1996, the Company and Mosby-Year Book, Inc. Mosby, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, completed an exchange pursuant to
which The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. sold all of the outstanding shares of
the capital stock of its subsidiary, Shepard/McGraw-Hill, Inc. Shepard,
to the Company in exchange for i the stock of Times Mirror Higher Education
Group, Inc., ii the assets and related liabilities of Mosby college-level
life and physical science text business, iii certain assets and liabilities
of Times Mirror International Publishers U.S., Inc. and affiliated entities
relating to the Company college text business and iv certain cash
consideration expected to be less than 10% of the fair value of the exchange
transaction.
In late November 1996, Shepard was contributed to a new 50/50 joint
venture between the Company and Reed Elsevier Inc. Reed as part of a broader
strategic alliance between Matthew Bender, Times Mirror legal publisher, and
LEXIS-NEXIS, a Reed subsidiary and a provider of full-text online information
services in the legal, news, business and government areas. The Company
received $242,500,000 from Reed for the 50% interest in the Shepard joint
venture. This transaction did not result in a gain or loss.
During 1996, the Company had several other small acquisitions which were
accounted for by the purchase method. The operations of these companies are
reflected in the Company financial statements from the date of acquisition.
These acquisitions resulted in goodwill of $21,399,000, which is being
amortized from 8 to 15 years.
During 1995, asset sales resulted in a gain of $41,435,000, or $25,821,000
after applicable income taxes. Gains on the sale of securities, including
equity securities in Graphic Holdings, Inc. and a newsprint manufacturer, were
partially offset by losses on the disposal of newspaper-related equipment, the
sale of The Sporting Goods Dealer and the sale of a small book printing
business. Restructuring-related writedowns and charges of $43,851,000, or
$40,687,000 after applicable income taxes, were recorded in 1995 to state
certain investments at their net realizable value and record certain
investment-related commitments.
During 1994, the Company recognized a gain of $22,099,000, or $10,646,000
after applicable income taxes, on the divestiture of a small elementary-high
school book publishing operation and the sale of preferred stock and common
stock warrants, obtained as part of the 1992 settlement of a note receivable
related to the 1987 sale of the Denver Post.

NOTE 3--REORGANIZATION
New TMC, Inc. was an entity formed, in connection with the 1995 tax-free
reorganization, to facilitate the merger of the Company cable television
operations with Cox Communications, Inc. Cox. The Company corporate
predecessor transferred all of its non-cable operations to New TMC, Inc.
simultaneously with the February 1, 1995 merger of its cable television
operations with Cox. Subsequent to the merger, New TMC, Inc. was renamed The
Times Mirror Company. Financial statement references to the Company apply to
New TMC, Inc. predecessor for events and transactions occurring prior to the
merger. As a result of the merger, Cox assumed approximately $136 billion of
debt, of which $131 billion was borrowed by the Company shortly before the
merger. New TMC, Inc. received cash proceeds of $123 billion, primarily from
the debt issuance, and used the funds to retire $588,010,000 of commercial
paper, short-term borrowings and other debt.
As additional consideration, Cox issued 54,904,000 shares of its Class A
common stock to the non-controlling shareholders of the Company, which group
excludes all Chandler Trust shareholders. This stock had a fair value of
$932,000,000. Due to certain constraints imposed by the terms of the Chandler
Trusts, in lieu of common stock of Cox, the Chandler Trusts received Series A
preferred stock. In connection with the settlement of reorganization-related
litigation, all non-controlling shareholders were offered the opportunity to
exchange shares of Series A or Series C common stock for shares of Series B
preferred stock. Accordingly, 16,561,178 shares of Series B preferred stock
were issued pursuant to this settlement offer.
As a result of this reorganization and merger, the Company recognized a
nontaxable gain of $163 billion on the disposal of its cable television
operations.
NOTE 4--DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Discontinued operations include cable programming, consumer multimedia, an
electronic shopping joint venture and cable television. The cable programming
business, consumer multimedia business and the joint venture were discontinued
during the third quarter of 1995. The cable television operations were
disposed of on February 1, 1995.
The combined results of operations of these businesses have been reported as
discontinued operations for all periods presented. The income loss from
discontinued operations is as follows in thousands:

were estimated operating costs during the exit period, writedowns of
assets to net realizable value, and severance and other closure costs
aggregating $69,755,000, or $49,627,000 after income tax benefits, related
to the discontinuance of cable programming, consumer multimedia and a
joint venture.

NOTE 5--RESTRUCTURING
During 1996, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $50,924,000, or
$30,305,000 after applicable income taxes, which included reserves related to
changing the domestic distribution channels and consolidating and closing
selected offices for the medical publishing operations as well as costs and
asset writeoffs to further integrate the training companies. The remaining
1996 restructuring liability at December 31, 1996 was $10,205,000.
During 1995, the Company recorded restructuring, impairment and one-time
charges of $634,077,000, or $410,623,000 after applicable income taxes.
Additional charges of $90,030,000 were also included in 1995 results. These
charges did not meet the accounting criteria for inclusion in restructuring
charges, but were part of the Company 1995 restructuring program, along with
additional pre-tax charges of $69,755,000 related to discontinued operations
see Note 4 and $43,851,000 related to investment writedowns see Note 2.
The remaining 1995 restructuring liability at December 31, 1996 was
$148,520,000. The 1995 charges were comprised of the following:
Restructuring: Restructuring costs aggregating $409,238,000 consisted of
$153,764,000 for termination benefit costs, $126,412,000 for estimated
sublease and lease abandonment losses, $117,152,000 for asset write-offs and
$11,910,000 for other costs. The termination benefits were largely severance
costs that covered approximately 2,700 full-time equivalent employees company-
wide, of which 1,900 were in the Newspaper Publishing segment. Severance
payments were $45,846,000 and $92,755,000 during 1996 and 1995, respectively.
Some terminated employees are receiving severance payments over time. The
remaining liability for severance costs at December 31, 1996 aggregated
$18,230,000. The sublease and lease abandonment losses primarily covered
office space in New York City, largely related to the closure of New York
Newsday on July 17, 1995 and the consolidation of office space. Approximately
268,000 square feet has been abandoned and 21,000 square feet has been
subleased. The asset write-offs were primarily goodwill and other intangibles
related to the closure of Baltimore Evening Sun on September 15, 1995, the
abandonment of the magazines' sports marketing business and the abandonment of
other products or product lines, primarily in the health sciences and college
publishing businesses.
Impairment: In connection with the restructuring of operations at Times
Mirror Magazines, magazine titles that historically had operating losses, and
that did not have the estimated future earnings necessary to recover asset
values, were reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS 121 see Note 1.
The net book value of
36
THE TIMES MIRROR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
the primary long-lived asset, goodwill, exceeded the undiscounted estimated
future cash flows for certain magazine titles. The $36,096,000 difference
between the net book value and the fair value was recorded as an impairment
loss in 1995. The fair value was based on estimated future cash flows
discounted at the Company cost of capital. In connection with the 1995
restructuring of its college publishing business, the Company recorded an
impairment loss of $24,797,000 on certain printing, fulfillment and
distribution facilities.
One-Time Charges: One-time charges aggregating $163,946,000 were primarily
related to employee benefit costs incurred in the renegotiation of union
agreements at Newsday and the writedown of certain idle facilities and
equipment.
The balance sheet classification of restructuring liabilities is as follows
in thousands:

The current portion of the restructuring liabilities relates primarily to
severance and other employee benefit-related costs while the noncurrent
portion principally relates to lease payments which will be paid over lease
periods extending to 2004.
NOTE 6--INTEREST, SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW AND OTHER INFORMATION
Cash payments during the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994
included interest, net of amounts capitalized, of $24,609,000, $29,218,000 and
$71,654,000, respectively, and income taxes of $74,164,000, $84,968,000 and
$107,865,000, respectively. Interest capitalized during the years ended
December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 was not significant.

Short-Term Assets and Liabilities: The fair value of cash and cash
equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable
approximates their carrying value due to the short-term nature of these
financial instruments. Marketable securities at December 31, 1996 are
available-for-sale equity securities with a cost of $4,050,000. The unrealized
gain is included as a separate component of shareholders' equity, net of
applicable income taxes.
Long-Term Equity Securities: Available-for-sale equity securities which are
classified as long-term are stated at fair value based on estimated or quoted
market prices and are included in Other assets in the consolidated balance
sheets. The cost of the securities was $4,000,000 and $7,937,000 at December
31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The unrealized gain is included as a separate
component of shareholders' equity, net of applicable income taxes.
Long-Term Debt: The fair value of long-term debt is based primarily on the
Company current refinancing rates for publicly issued fixed rate debt with
comparable maturities except for the premium equity participating securities
whose fair value is the current maturity value determined by a formula based
on quoted market prices of the underlying common stock.
Interest Rate Swap: An interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount of
$100,000,000, expiring in 2023, effectively converts a portion of the
Company long-term fixed rate debt to a variable rate obligation based on
LIBOR. The fair value of the swap is the amount at which it could be settled
based on estimates of market rates. In May 1996, the Company terminated an
interest rate swap as well as its two forward swap agreements.

In March 1996, the Company issued 1,305,000 securities, designated as 4 1/4%
Premium Equity Participating Securities PEPS, for gross proceeds of
$51,221,000 or $3925 per security. This obligation hedges a significant
portion of the Company investment in the common stock of Netscape
Communications Corporation Netscape.

THE TIMES MIRROR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
The amount payable at maturity is determined by reference to the fair market
value of the Netscape stock. As a result, the maturity value will generally
move in tandem with changes in the fair market value of the Netscape stock.
The PEPS obligation is recorded a at the issuance price of $3925 if the
fair market value of Netscape common stock is between $3925 and $4513 or b
at 8696% of the fair market value when the Netscape common stock exceeds
$4513. At December 31, 1996, the fair market value of Netscape common stock
was $56875 per share, resulting in a maturity value of approximately $4946
per security at that date. Changes in the maturity value of the PEPS are
included as a separate component of shareholders' equity, net of applicable
income taxes.
Interest rate swaps converted the weighted average interest rate on the
debentures due in 2013 and 2023 from 735% to 609% for the year ended
December 31, 1996. The unamortized discount at December 31, 1996 relates to
the 100-year debentures issued in 1996.
The Company has an agreement with several domestic and foreign banks for
unsecured long-term revolving lines of credit that expire in September 2000.
This agreement provides for borrowings up to $400,000,000 at interest rates
based on, at the Company option, the banks' base rates, Eurodollar rates or
competitive bid rates. The commitment fee is approximately 8/100 of one
percent per annum. The lines of credit are used to support a commercial paper
program. Commercial paper was issued during the last half of 1996 but was
repaid prior to December 31, 1996. During 1996, the weighted average interest
rate and weighted average commercial paper borrowings were 540% and
$63,959,000, respectively. In addition, the Company has $69,078,000 of undrawn
standby letters of credit at December 31, 1996.
The Company revolving lines of credit contain restrictive provisions
relating primarily to the level of consolidated net worth. At December 31,
1996, consolidated net worth was required to be not less than approximately
$137 billion.
The Company completed a tender offer in December 1994 for $345,179,000 of
its Medium-Term Notes and its three other notes due 1999 thru 2001. The
premium and related costs of the tender, aggregating $20,749,000, or
$12,232,000 after taxes, were recorded as an extraordinary loss in 1994.
At December 31, 1996, the aggregate principal maturities of the Company
debt are as follows in thousands:

NOTE 12--CAPITAL STOCK AND STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
The Series A preferred stock is cumulative, non-voting stock and has an
annual dividend rate of 8% of its liquidation value of $411,784,000. The
Series B preferred stock is cumulative, voting stock and has an annual
dividend rate of $1374 per share. Both series of preferred stock were
entitled to dividends effective March 1, 1995. The Series B preferred stock is
mandatorily convertible into the Company Series A common stock on April 1,
1998, or earlier under certain circumstances see Note 21. The conversion
rate fluctuates with the value of the common stock, but it will not exceed a
one-for-one conversion rate. Preferred stock is issuable in series under such
terms and conditions as the Board of Directors may determine.
Shares of Series A and Series C common stock are identical, except with
respect to voting rights, restrictions on transfer of Series C shares and the
right to convert Series C shares into Series A shares. Series A shares are
entitled to one vote per share and Series C shares are entitled to ten votes
per share. Series C shares are subject
41
THE TIMES MIRROR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
to mandatory conversion into Series A shares upon transfer to any person other
than a Permitted Transferee as defined in the Company Certificate of
Incorporation or upon the occurrence of certain regulatory events. Series B
common stock is entitled to one-tenth vote per share and is available for
common stock issuance transactions, such as underwritten public offerings and
acquisitions.
During 1996, the Company repurchased 11,362,000 common shares for a total
cost of $496,780,000. An additional 45,000 common shares were repurchased for
$1,954,000 as a result of the exercise of a put option. There were 2,500,000
put options issued by the Company during 1996 with a weighted average strike
price of $4315 per common share. The cash received from the issuance of these
put options was not significant. The put options entitle the holder to sell
shares of Times Mirror Series A common stock to the Company at the strike
price on the expiration date of the put option. The potential obligation under
the 800,000 put options outstanding at December 31, 1996 has been transferred
from shareholders' equity to Common stock subject to put options. The
unexpired put options are at strike prices ranging from $4454 to $5248.
These put options expire at various times thru April 1997.
Also in 1996, as part of its share repurchase efforts, the Company entered
into a series of forward purchase agreements on 552,000 shares of its Series B
preferred stock. These contracts, which mature in 1998 but may be terminated
prior to maturity, may be settled on a net share basis in Series B preferred
stock or in Series A common stock if the Series B preferred stock is redeemed
prior to maturity of the contracts. The Company may also elect to settle the
contracts in cash. See Note 21.
During 1995, the Company repurchased 7,042,000 common shares and 8,772,000
Series B preferred shares for a total cost of $446,536,000. Some of the Series
B preferred shares were acquired through a tender offer which ended on
December 29, 1995. Other current liabilities in the consolidated balance
sheet at December 31, 1995 include $91,182,000 for settlement of the tender
offer on January 6, 1996.
In connection with the Company ongoing stock repurchase program, in
October 1996, the Company Board of Directors authorized the repurchase over
the next three years of an additional 12 million shares of common stock and
Series B preferred stock. The aggregate remaining shares authorized for
repurchase at December 31, 1996 is approximately 108 million shares. The
common shares purchased under this program are intended to offset dilution
from shares of common stock issued under the Company stock-based employee
compensation and benefit program as well as to enhance shareholder value.
NOTE 13--STOCK OPTION AND AWARD PLANS
The Company has various stock option plans under which options may be
granted to purchase shares of Series A common stock at a price equal to the
fair market value at the date of grant. Options that are not exercised expire
ten years from the date of grant. Options granted to key employees generally
vest over a four-year period. Grants made under a broad-based stock option
plan, for employees not eligible for other stock option grants, are fully
vested three years after the date of grant. Restricted stock is also awarded
to key employees. The number of restricted stock awards, including matching
awards in connection with the annual incentive bonus program, is not material.

In connection with the reorganization described in Note 3, the number of
options and the option price were adjusted in 1995 based on the average market
price for the five days before and after the reorganization was completed. The
adjustment increased the number of options outstanding and decreased the
option exercise price in order to preserve the economic value of the then
outstanding options.

December 31, 1996 is as follows:

At December 31, 1996 and 1995, there were 16,800,309 shares and 18,389,660
shares, respectively, reserved for future grants and awards under the various
plans.
If the Company recognized employee stock option-related compensation expense
in accordance with SFAS 123 and used the Black-Scholes option valuation model
for determining the weighted average fair value of options granted after
December 31, 1994, its net income and earnings per share would have been as
follows in thousands, except per share amounts:
1996    1995
Net  $206,444 $1,226,751
Pro forma stock compensation expense, net.  4,959    456
Pro forma net  $201,485 $1,226,295
Pro forma primary earnings per share. $  149 $  1001
Pro forma fully diluted earnings per share. $  148 $   940
43
THE TIMES MIRROR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
For purposes of the pro forma expense, the weighted average fair value of
the options is amortized over the vesting period. The pro forma effect on net
income for 1995 through 1998 will not be representative of future years'
impact because options granted prior to 1995 are excluded from the pro forma
calculations. Options are granted every year and the pro forma expense in
future years will grow due to the added layers of amortization for succeeding
grants. By 1999, however, the pro forma results will include a full four
years' worth of option grants.
The weighted average fair values of $887 for 1996 stock option grants and
$872 for 1995 stock option grants were estimated at the date of grant using
the following assumptions and the Black-Scholes option valuation model:
1996   1995
Risk-free interest    54%   60%
Expected  5 years 7 years
Expected    26   27
Expected dividend   200%  293 
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options. The Company employee stock options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options such as
vesting restrictions and lack of transferability. In addition, the assumptions
used in option valuation models are highly subjective, particularly the
expected stock price volatility for the underlying stock. Because changes in
these subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value
estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not provide a
reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

the 30-year limitation on years of benefit service, respectively.
Plan assets include the Company common and Series B preferred stocks,
other listed stocks, and corporate and government fixed-income securities. The
plan assets at December 31, 1996 include 632,000 shares of the Company
Series C common stock and 270,000 shares of Series B preferred stock with an
aggregate fair value of $38,951,000.
Benefits provided by the ESOP are coordinated with certain pension benefits

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
ESOP assets was $273,753,000 and $221,576,000 as of December 31, 1996 and
1995, respectively. At December 31, 1996, the ESOP held 2,536,000 shares of
Series A common stock, 1,753,000 shares of Series C common stock, and
2,570,000 shares of Cox Class A common stock. The Cox common stock, which was
received in connection with the reorganization described in Note 3, is
expected to be sold by the end of 1997 and the proceeds will be reinvested.
The ESOP currently covers approximately one-half of the Company employees.
The last contribution to the ESOP was in 1994 and the plan has been amended to
eliminate contributions by the Company. There are no unallocated shares in the
ESOP at December 31, 1996.
Substantially all employees over age 21 with one year of service are
eligible to participate in the Company Savings Plus Plan. Eligible employees
may contribute from 1 percent to 13 percent of their basic compensation. The
Company makes matching contributions equal to 50 percent of employee before-
tax contributions from 1 percent to 6 percent. Employees may choose among five
investment options, including a Company common stock fund, for investing their
contributions and the Company matching contribution. Defined contribution
plan expense, primarily related to the Savings Plus Plan, was $20,293,000 for
1996, $21,347,000 for 1995, and $21,553,000 for 1994.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
The assumed health care cost trend rate can significantly affect
postretirement expense and liabilities. An increase of 1 percent in the health
care cost trend rate would increase 1996 net periodic postretirement expense
by $1,496,000 and increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations
as of December 31, 1996 by $9,712,000.
A Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association VEBA trust funds certain

these business segments represent approximately 61%, 30% and 9%, respectively,
of the Company consolidated 1996 revenues. The Newspaper Publishing segment
publishes daily metropolitan newspapers in the east coast and west coast
regions of the United States, as well as several weekly newspapers. The
Professional Information segment publishes various books and other media,
including legal and health information services publications, aeronautical
charts and flight information, sales and management training programs and,
prior to October 15, 1996, higher education textbooks. The Consumer Media
segment publishes special interest and trade magazines and art books see Note
20. Total revenue by industry segment includes sales to unaffiliated
customers and intersegment sales, which are accounted for at market price.
NOTE 17--USE OF ESTIMATES AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES
Financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles require management to make estimates and judgments that
affect amounts and disclosures reported in the financial statements. Actual
results could differ from those estimates, although management does not
believe that any differences would materially affect the Company financial
position or reported results.
The Company future results could be adversely affected by a number of
factors, including a an increase in paper, printing and distribution costs
over the levels anticipated; b increased consolidation among major retailers
or other events depressing the level of display advertising; c an economic
downturn in the Company principal newspaper markets or other occurrences
leading to decreased circulation and diminished revenues from both display and
classified advertising; d competitive pressures arising from increased
consolidation in the legal information industry; e an increase in expenses
related to new initiatives and product improvement efforts in the legal
information, flight information and health information operating units; f
unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations; and g a general economic downturn
resulting in decreased professional or corporate spending on discretionary
items such as information or training and in decreased consumer spending on
discretionary items such as magazines or newspapers.

THE TIMES MIRROR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
NOTE 19--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in actions for libel and
other matters arising out of their business operations. In addition, from time
to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved as parties in various
governmental and administrative proceedings, including environmental matters.
The Company does not believe that any such proceedings currently pending will
have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position,
although an adverse resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these
matters could have a material impact on results of operations for that period.
To assure a long-term supply of newsprint for the Los Angeles Times, the
Company has an agreement with a supplier to purchase specified quantities of
newsprint at prevailing market prices. The specified quantities represent a
majority of The Times' newsprint requirements.
NOTE 20--PENDING SALE OF ASSETS
On September 4, 1996, the Company announced its intention to sell Harry N.
Abrams, Inc., which completes the Company plan to exit the trade book
business. Harry N. Abrams is the premier publisher of art and illustrated
books in the U.S. and also publishes textbooks, children books and
calendars. The sale is expected to close in the first half of 1997.
NOTE 21--EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO DATE OF AUDITORS' REPORT
On February 28, 1997, the Company announced that it would redeem all of its
outstanding Series B preferred stock on April 2, 1997. Each share of Series B
preferred stock will be exchanged for 57083 of a share of Series A common
stock. The exchange ratio was determined pursuant to the original terms of the
Series B preferred stock. Forward purchase contracts for 3,900,000 shares of
Series B preferred stock were outstanding on February 28, 1997, largely due to
contracts for 3,348,000 shares entered into subsequent to December 31, 1996.
The Company expects that these forward contracts will be settled in net shares
of Series A common stock as they mature. At February 28, 1997, the forward
purchase contracts had a weighted average forward price of $28475 per
Series B share and, if settled in Series A common shares based on the exchange
ratio, the Company would be entitled to receive approximately 2,226,000 Series
A common shares.
