40 Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Business Operations
and Basis of Presentation: Dominion
Homes, Inc. is a single-family homebuilder with operations in Central Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky. The Company was incorporated in October 1993 in anticipation of its initial public offering of common shares in March 1994. Prior to the initial
public offering, the homebuilding operations were part of BRC Properties Inc. BRC, formerly known as Borror Realty Company. BRC was incorporated in 1946 and started building homes in 1976. Donald Borror, the Companys Chairman
Emeritus of the Board, traces his homebuilding experience to several homes he constructed in 1952. BRC owned 3,850,424 common shares of the Company, or 469% of its outstanding common shares, at December 31, 2002. On November 16, 1999, Dominion Homes, Inc. formed Dominion
Homes Financial Services, Ltd. DHFS to provide mortgage-financing services, primarily to its customers. DHFS became operational in second quarter 2000 and by the end of 2000 provided mortgage-financing services to most of the
Companys customers. On December 30, 1999, Dominion Homes, Inc. formed Dominion Homes of Kentucky, Ltd. DHK to own and operate the Companys homebuilding operations in Louisville, Kentucky. DHFS is an Ohio limited liability
company and DHK is a Kentucky limited partnership. Both entities are wholly owned by Dominion Homes, Inc. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DHFS and DHK. Inter-company transactions are eliminated in
consolidation. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
Cash and Cash Equivalents: For
purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. Real Estate Inventories: Real estate inventories are recorded at cost. Land and land development costs
are allocated to development phases based on the total number of lots expected to be developed within each subdivision. As each development phase is completed, land development costs, including capitalized interest and real estate taxes, are then
allocated to individual lots. Homes under construction include land development costs, construction costs, capitalized interest and indirect costs related to development and construction activities. Indirect costs that do not relate to development
and construction activities, including general and administrative expenses, are charged to expense as incurred. Other inventories consist primarily of lumber and building supplies. Management evaluates the recoverability of its real estate inventories using several factors including, but
not limited to, managements plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows. The Company recognized an impairment loss of approximately $1,797,000, $1,378,000 and $889,000 on real estate inventories for the years
ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS No. 144, which addresses accounting and
reporting standards for the impairment or disposal 
41 of long-lived assets. In
accordance with this standard, the Company regularly evaluates the recoverability of real estate inventories consistent with its existing accounting policies. During 2001, the Company decided to sell certain raw land that was not consistent with
current land development strategies. The carrying value of land held for sale was approximately $3,700,000 at December 31, 2001 and the land was subsequently sold on April 30, 2002 for approximately $3,800,000. The cost of this land had been reduced
to its estimated net realizable value prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 144. Property and Equipment: Depreciation and amortization are recognized on the straight-line method at rates adequate to amortize costs over the estimated useful lives of the applicable assets. The
estimated useful lives of the assets range from three to forty years. Property and equipment includes assets subject to capital leases with a cost of $2,322,000 and $2,118,000, net of accumulated amortization of $3,108,000 and $994,000 at December
31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense was $2,946,000, $1,591,000, and $1,099,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to expense as incurred while major renewals and
betterments are capitalized and amortized. The asset cost and accumulated depreciation for assets sold or retired is removed, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations. The Company assesses the impairment of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable from its future undiscounted cash flows. If it is determined that an impairment has occurred, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the
asset exceeds its estimated fair value. Earnings Per Share: Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per
common share computations include common share equivalents, when dilutive. Common share equivalents include stock options and restricted common shares. Warranty Costs: The Company provides a two-year limited warranty on materials and workmanship and a thirty-year warranty against
major structural defects. An estimated amount of warranty cost is provided for each home at the date of closing based on historical warranty experience. Warranty expense was $3,877,000, $3,351,000 and $3,552,000 for the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Accrued warranty cost was $3,998,000 and $2,568,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 
42 A
reconciliation of the changes in the warranty liability for the year ending December 31, 2002 is as follows:  Balance at the beginning of the period
$
2,568,000
Accruals for warranties issued during the period
1,851,000
Accruals related to pre-existing warranties including changes in
estimates
2,026,000
Settlements made in cash or in kind during the period
2,447,000
Balance at the end of the period
$
3,998,000
Income Taxes: The Company records income taxes on the liability method. This method requires the recognition of deferred income taxes for the tax effect of temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and such amounts as determined by tax regulations based on enacted tax rates. Revenue Recognition on Sales of Real Estate: The Company recognizes revenues from the sale of homes, including fees earned for
mortgage financing services, at the time it conveys title to the buyer. Accounts receivable due from financial institutions represent payments to be received on completed closings. Gains on sales of model homes subject to leasing arrangements are
deferred and recognized over the term of the lease. Capitalization of Interest: The Company capitalizes the cost of interest related to construction costs incurred during the construction period of homes and land development costs incurred while development activities on
undeveloped land are in process. The summary of total interest is as follows:  Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 Interest incurred

Deferred Costs: Fees and costs incurred in connection with financing agreements are capitalized as other assets and amortized over the terms of the respective agreements. Amortization expense was $752,000, $629,000 and
$549,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. Advertising Costs: The Company expenses advertising costs when incurred. Advertising expense was $4,592,000, $4,404,000 and $3,397,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. 
43 Stock-Based
Compensation: The Company has elected to follow the intrinsic value method to account for compensation expense related to the award of stock options and to furnish the pro forma disclosures required under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. Because the Companys stock option awards are granted at prices not less than the fair-market value of the shares at the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized for these awards. Compensation expense
related to restricted share awards is determined at the date of grant, recorded as unearned compensation expense and amortized over the vesting period of the awarded shares. The unearned compensation expense related to such awards is reflected as a
reduction of stockholders equity. Had
compensation cost for stock options been determined based on the fair value of awards at the grant dates, the Companys net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:  2002 2001 2000 Net income, as reported

The
weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was $1173, $750 and $403 for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In determining the pro forma amount of stock-based compensation, the fair value of each option grant is estimated on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: no dividend yield; expected volatility of 50% for 2002, 2001 and 2000; risk-free interest rates of 46%, 52%, and 65% for the 2002,
2001 and 2000 Plan options, respectively; and expected life of 6 years for the Plan options. Segment Information: The Companys homebuilding operations, which are conducted in two geographic regions, have similar characteristics including the product offerings, pricing and margins
and as such, have been aggregated. The Companys mortgage operations directly support its core homebuilding operations and services to outside parties are rare. Therefore, the mortgage operations and the homebuilding operations have been
aggregated into one reportable segment the homebuilding segment. Utilization of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. 
44 Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements: In
November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies,
relating to the guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. This Interpretation clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of certain types of guarantees, a liability
for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this Interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31,
2002, irrespective of the guarantors fiscal year-end. The disclosure requirements in this Interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Company adopted the disclosure
requirements related to product warranties at December 31, 2002. The Company is assessing the impact that the adoption of the remaining provisions of this Interpretation will have on its results of operations and financial position. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 148 FAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FAS 123. The transition and annual disclosure provisions of FAS 148 are effective
for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The new interim disclosure provisions are effective for the first interim period beginning after December 15, 2002. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements at December 31, 2002. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46
FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entitiesan interpretation of ARB No. 51. FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to certain
entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other
parties. This Interpretation explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. FIN 46 requires existing unconsolidated
variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved. This Interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31,
2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a
variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. The Company is evaluating the characteristics of its investments in land development joint ventures and Alliance Title Agency to determine whether these investments are variable interest
entities requiring consolidation under the provisions of FIN 46. 3. Related Entity: Alliance Title Agency was created in order to provide title insurance to our customers and third parties and to facilitate the closing of our homes. The Company owns 499% of the 
45 title insurance agency and
reports its investment using the equity method of accounting. The Company recognized $499,000, $553,000 and $455,000 as its share of the earnings from this investment for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The Companys investment in the title
insurance company was $110,000 and $245,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 4.

Land Development Joint Ventures: The Company has equity interests, generally ranging from 33% to 80%, in joint venture partnerships and limited liability corporations that
are engaged in land development activities. The Company accounts for these investments using the equity method. Development costs of the joint ventures generally are funded by the participants. The participants in the joint ventures acquire
substantially all of the developed lots. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its investments in joint ventures using the same criteria as for other real estate inventories. The Companys investment in joint ventures, which is included
in land and land development costs, was $13,529,000 and $13,944,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In certain cases, the Company may be liable under debt commitments within a particular joint venture. At December 31, 2002, the Company
was party to one joint venture that financed its own development activities. The Company has guaranteed this joint ventures loan agreement up to $12 million, representing its one-half interest in this joint venture. This joint ventures
development activity is expected to last approximately one to two more years, by which time the developed lots will have been sold and the Companys guarantee terminated. The Company believes its exposure under the guarantee is limited because
the underlying market value of the land under development is believed to be greater than the amount of the guarantee. At December 31, 2002, this joint venture had $920,000 in loans outstanding and the portion subject to the Companys guaranty
was $460,000. Summary financial information

47 7. Note Payable, Banks:
On December 31, 2001, the Company entered
into an Amended and Restated $175,000,000 Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility the Facility that is in effect through May 31, 2005. Eight banks participate in the Facility, led by Huntington National Bank, which serves as the
Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank under the Facility. The Facility was amended on June 10, 2002 to reduce the minimum ownership interest, from 50% to 30%, that the Borror Family is required to hold in the Company before a change in control occurs under the Facility. This
amendment permitted the Company and BRC to sell common shares in a public offering. During 2002, the Company sold an aggregate of 1,503,900 common shares and received net proceeds of approximately $27,400,000 which were used to reduce debt under the
Facility. BRC sold an aggregate of 353,900 common shares in the public offering. The Facility was amended on December 31, 2002 to increase to $5,000,000 from $3,000,000 the amount of capital assets the Company is permitted to lease or finance outside of the Facility, to maintain a
combined limit on operating lease rentals of $5,000,000 for model homes and other operating leases, to increase the tangible net worth the Company is required to maintain to $110,000,000 plus 75% of 2003 and subsequent years consolidated net
income from $73,000,000 plus 75% of 2002 and subsequent years consolidated net income and to reduce the required Leverage Ratio to not greater than 225 to 100 from 250 to 100. The changes to the capital assets and operating lease rentals
restrictions were made in order to allow the Company additional capacity for capital lease obligations and operating lease rentals. The tangible net worth requirement and Leverage Ratio changes were made as a response to the improved capital
structure that resulted from the Companys sale of additional common shares earlier in the year. As of December 31, 2002 the Facility, as amended, contained the following significant provisions: 1 a limit on aggregate borrowings and
letters of credit to the lesser of $175,000,000 or the availability under the borrowing base; 2 the Company has the option to use any combination of the following methods to price the revolving line of credit: a the banks prime rate of
interest or b a Eurodollar rate of interest plus a variable margin based upon the ratio of EBITDA to Interest Expense Interest Coverage Ratio; 3 the Company has agreed to enter into interest rate contracts in the amount of fifty
percent of the outstanding borrowings in the event the Eurodollar rate without regard to the variable margin becomes 850% per annum or greater; 4 the Company has agreed to the following ratios: a Interest Coverage Ratio of not less than 225
to 100 determined quarterly and based upon the preceding four quarters; b total liabilities to tangible net worth leverage ratio of not greater than 225 to 100; 5 the Company has agreed to maintain at all times a ratio of uncommitted land
holdings to tangible net worth not greater than 200 to 100; 6 the Company may not, without lender approval, exceed the aggregate sum of $25,000,000 for investments in uncommitted land holdings, speculative homes, model homes and acquisitions of
companies in the homebuilding industry outside of Central Ohio or metropolitan Louisville, Kentucky, and the Company may not invest more than 
48 15,000,000 on any single
market outside of Central Ohio or metropolitan Louisville, Kentucky; 7 the Company must maintain a tangible net worth of not less than $110,000,000 plus 75% percent of annual net income beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2003; 8
other borrowings may not exceed the aggregate principal sum of $10,000,000, of which additional debt or capital lease obligations may not exceed $5,000,000; provided that the Company may borrow up to $5,000,000 in addition to the $10,000,000 of
other borrowings of non-recourse indebtedness from sellers of real estate if such additional non-recourse borrowings are fully reserved under the borrowing base; 9 the Company may not exceed $5,000,000 of annual operating lease rentals; 10 the
Company may not purchase, without lender approval, unzoned land in excess of $2,500,000; 11 the Company may not permit the value of its inventory homes to exceed $20,000,000, its fall foundation inventories to exceed 200 homes or $9,000,000 and
its model homes to exceed $6,500,000; 12 the Company may not incur a loss during any five consecutive quarters; 13 the Company may not pay dividends during any calendar year in excess of twenty-five percent of its consolidated net income after
taxes for such year and 14 the Company may not repurchase more than $500,000 which amount was increased by an amendment dated February 13, 2003 to $4,000,000 during any one year and $7,000,000 in the aggregate from December 31, 2001 of common
shares of Dominion Homes, Inc. during any fiscal year. The Facility provides for a variable rate of interest on its borrowings. In order to reduce the risks caused by interest rate fluctuations, the Company has entered into interest rate swap contracts that fix the interest rate on a
portion of its borrowings under the Facility. The Companys intention is to maintain a fixed rate of interest on not less than 50% of its outstanding borrowings. However, market conditions and timing effect the Companys ability to
maintain this balance between fixed and variable interest rates. As of December 31, 2002 the Company had fixed the interest rate on 72%, or $80,000,000, of bank borrowings using interest rate swap contracts Contracts. Included in the
interest rate swaps at December 31, 2002 were a $10,000,000 interest rate swap at 596% that matures May 6, 2003, a $20,000,000 interest rate swap at 598% that matures January 12, 2004, a $20,000,000 interest rate swap at 558% that matures January
12, 2005, a $10,000,000 interest rate swap at 516% that matures March 8, 2004, a $10,000,000 interest rate swap at 454% that matures September 12, 2004 and a $10,000,000 interest rate swap at 316% that matures October 4, 2005. The fixed interest
rates noted for the above interest rate swaps do not include a variable margin that the Company also pays that is based on the Companys Interest Coverage Ratio. The variable margin ranges from 175% to 250% and is determined quarterly 175%
at December 31, 2002. The fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was a liability of $4,000,000 at December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with the Facility covenants and had $64,900,000 available under the Facility, after
adjustment for borrowing base limitations. Borrowing availability under the Facility could increase, depending on the use of proceeds of borrowings under the Facility. Amounts outstanding under the Facility were $111,070,000 and $131,511,000 as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
Company had $2,001,000 in irrevocable letters of credit and $33,500,000 of performance bonds outstanding at December 31, 2002. The letters of credit and performance bonds were issued to municipalities and other individuals to ensure performance and
completion of certain land development activities and as collateral for land purchase commitments.

Instruments and Hedging Activities: The
Companys interest rate risk management strategy uses derivative instruments to minimize earnings fluctuations caused by interest rate volatility associated with variable rate debt. The derivative financial instruments used to meet our risk
management objectives are interest rate swaps the Contracts. The Company seeks to maintain the notional amount of the Contracts at not less than 50% of its outstanding debt. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and SFAS No. 138, an amendment to SFAS No. 133, which established new accounting and reporting guidelines for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 and SFAS
No. 138 are collectively referred to herein as SFAS 133. In adopting SFAS 133, the Company has designated its Contracts as cash flow hedges. The after tax fair value of these Contracts at the date of adoption was $94,000. The fair value of these Contracts at the date of adoption
of SFAS 133 together with changes in their fair value in subsequent periods are recognized in other comprehensive income or loss until such time as the Contracts mature or are terminated. Other comprehensive income or loss is reflected as a
component of shareholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Contracts is principally impacted by fluctuations in interest rates, which continued to decline during 2002. This decline in interest rates
led to an unrealized after-tax loss on the Contracts of approximately $730,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 and a pre-tax accrued liability of $4,000,000 at December 31, 2002. The Company does not expect this loss to be realized because the
Company expects to retain the Contracts to maturity. Future fluctuations in interest rates will cause unrealized gains or losses to occur and such amounts will be adjusted through other comprehensive income or loss as long as the effectiveness of
the hedge is maintained. The Company formally
documents relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the 
51 hedging transactions. An
assessment is made at the hedging transactions inception, and on an ongoing basis, to determine whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. The Company
believes the Contracts have been effective in achieving the risk management objectives and will continue to be effective for the remaining term of the Contracts. Hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative change in fair
value between the Contracts and the hedged item over time. Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness, as defined by SFAS 133, is recognized immediately in earnings. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, no gain or loss has
been recognized in earnings as no amount of the cash flow hedges have been determined to be ineffective. Should it be determined that a Contract is not effective or that it has ceased to be an effective hedge, the Company will discontinue
hedge accounting prospectively. This will occur when 1 offsetting changes in the fair value of cash flows of the hedged items is no longer effective; 2 the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; or 3 management determines
that designation of the Contract as a hedged instrument is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued because a Contract qualifying as a cash flow hedge is liquidated or sold prior to maturity, the gain or loss on the Contract at
the time of termination remains in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the original contract term. In all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, the
derivative will be carried at its fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in its fair value recognized in current earnings. 11. Income Taxes: The provision for income taxes consists of the following for the years ended December 31:  2002 2001 2000 Currently payable Federal

12. Related Party
Transactions: The Company leases its
corporate offices from BRC. The lease was effective January 1, 1998 for a term of twelve years with a rental rate of $1200 per square foot on a total net basis. The lease contains two options to renew for periods of five years each at then-current
market rates. The rental rates were established by an MAI appraiser commissioned by the Affiliated Transaction Review Committee of the Companys Board of Directors, and confirmed in a review by a second MAI appraiser. Lease expense was $451,000
for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000. The Company and BRC have also entered into operating lease agreements under which the Company leases space in a shopping center from BRC. Lease expense under these agreements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 was
$237,000, $162,000 and $156,000, respectively. These lease agreements have been approved by the Companys Affiliated Transaction Review Committee. BRC paid the Company $10,000 in 2002, $12,500 in 2001, $25,000 in 2000, for miscellaneous services performed by Company personnel.
53 The Company
acquired printing services from a printing company principally owned by members of the Borror family. Such services aggregated $142,651, $137,326, and $98,496 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 13. Retirement Plan: The Company offers a retirement plan, intended to meet the
requirements of Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code, which covers substantially all employees after one year of service. The Company matches 100% of the first 3% and 50% of the next 2% of employee voluntary deferrals of compensation. The
Companys contributions to the plan amounted to $671,000, $607,000 and $511,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 14. Incentive Stock, Executive Deferred Compensation and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans: In March 1994, the Company adopted the Dominion Homes, Inc.
Incentive Stock Plan the Plan. The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, and provides for grants of performance awards of Common Shares, restricted Common Shares, incentive stock options and
non-qualified stock options for the purpose of attracting, motivating and retaining employees and eligible directors. The Plan provides for discretionary grants to employees of the Company and annual non-discretionary stock option grants to purchase
2,500 shares of stock to each non-employee director. A maximum of 850,000 Common Shares has been reserved for issuance under the Plan. The Plan provides that grants shall include certain terms and conditions and be subject to certain
restrictions as provided for under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and federal securities laws.Restricted Common Shares issued to employees vest 20% per year except in instances that require the Companys adjusted net
worth to exceed $100 million if the restricted common shares were granted prior to August 1, 2002 or $175 million if granted on or after August 1, 2002 and the employee to remain with the Company at least 5 years after the date of grant. The
Company issued 100,000 shares, 30,000 shares and 30,000 shares, subject to the adjusted net worth and length of employment requirement, for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. In general, grants of options are subject to vesting
schedules at twenty percent a year, have an exercise price that is equal to the fair market value on the grant date 110% of the fair market value for 10% shareholders, and must be exercised within ten years of the grant date 5 years for 10%
shareholders. In December 1994, the Company
adopted a non-qualified Executive Deferred Compensation Plan for directors and certain executives. Under this plan, participants may elect to defer a portion of their compensation up to 20% of total base and bonus for employees and 100% of director
fees. At December 31 of each year, the Company provides a matching contribution of 25% of the amount deferred in a given year by a participant, provided that the Companys matching contribution will not exceed $2,500 in any year. The
Companys contribution vests in 20% increments over a five-year period. The Company recognized expense for the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan of $179,000, $199,000 and $80,000 for the plan years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. As originally adopted, contributions were to be converted into theoretical common shares and adjusted in future periods 
54 based on the market value of
the Common Shares, similar to stock appreciation rights. On October 29, 1997, the Board of Directors approved an Amended and Restated Executive Deferred Compensation Plan under which contribution and matching amounts are used by the trustee to
acquire Common Shares in the open market. These Common Shares are held and voted by the trustee pursuant to a Rabbi Trust Agreement. In July 1999, the Company entered into split dollar agreements the Split Dollar Plan that provided life insurance benefits
to certain employees in the event that certain performance and employment criteria were met. Participating employees were provided with a death benefit during employment, together with a retirement benefit upon retirement at or after age 55 or, if
sooner, upon a change in control of the Company, provided a the employee shall have then completed ten years of service with the Company following implementation of the agreement, b the Company shall have attained adjusted
shareholders equity of $100 million, and c the employee shall have complied with the provisions of the noncompetition covenant for one year following retirement. Under the terms of the Split Dollar Plan, each participating employee paid a
portion of the policy premiums; the remainder of the premiums were paid by the Company in cash. The cash value of life insurance contracts was $1,143,000 and $1,218,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2001, the Company determined it was probable that adjusted
shareholders equity would likely exceed $100 million during the term of employee participation in the plan. Accordingly, the Company began to accrue a pro rata share of the total estimated benefit of $4,959,000 over the minimum ten-year term
of participation required to earn the benefit. Amounts expensed under these agreements during 2002 and 2001 were $328,000 and $350,000. If for any reason, the above criteria are not met or adjusted shareholders equity does not exceed $100
million, any accrued benefits will be recognized as income at that time. In December of 2002, the Company discontinued the split dollar plan arrangement and each of the participating employees assigned all of his or her interest in the employees life insurance policy to the Company in
exchange for the Companys agreement to provide the employee with a death benefit equal to the face value of the life insurance policy, should the employee die during the course of his or her employment, and a payment in cash equivalent to the
portion of the premiums which the participants had personally paid. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company established a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan that provides retirement benefits to covered employees but only if they terminate employment other than because of
death 1 after participating in the program for the number of years specified in their participation agreement, 2 after the Companys net worth exceeds $100,000,000 or higher amount specified in their participation agreement, 3 is
terminated by the Company without cause as defined in the plan, 4 terminates voluntarily but for good reason as defined in the plan or 5 there is a change in control as defined in the plan. The amount of the benefit is determined on account
balances established for each covered employee to which the Company makes a discretionary annual credit.

Contingencies: The Company is involved in
various legal proceedings, most of which arise in the ordinary course of business and some of which are covered by insurance. In the opinion of the Companys management, none of the claims relating to such proceedings will have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. On December 6, 2002, the Company purchased land adjacent to the main corporate office facility in order to build a second office building in which the Company will consolidate various short-term leased
facilities and provide for future growth. The new office facility is expected to cost approximately $4,500,000. It is the Companys intention to sell and lease back this facility from an as yet undetermined third party. The Company anticipates
financing this expansion with borrowings under the Facility until the building is sold.
