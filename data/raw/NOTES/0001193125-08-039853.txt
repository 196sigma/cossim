ITEM8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA  COMPANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The financial statements and related information contained in this Annual Report have been
prepared by and are the responsibility of our management. Our financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and reflect judgments and estimates as to the expected
effects of transactions and events currently being reported. Our management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the financial statements and other financial information included in this Annual Report. To meet this responsibility, we
maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly executed and recorded. The system includes policies and procedures, internal audits and our
officers reviews.  Our Audit Committee of our Board of Directors is
composed solely of directors who are independent under applicable SEC and New York Stock Exchange rules. Our Audit Committee meets periodically and, when appropriate, separately with representatives of the independent registered public accounting
firm, our officers and the internal auditors to monitor the activities of each.  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, was appointed by our Audit Committee to audit our financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting and their report follows. Our
stockholders ratified the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP at the 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by
Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. The Companys system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Based on its assessment, management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2007, based on criteria in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, issued by the COSO. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included below.  /s/ William H. Swanson s/ David C. Wajsgras

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Raytheon Company:
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders equity, and of cash flow present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Raytheon Company and its subsidiaries at December31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.  As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, in
2007, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for, and discloses, uncertain tax positions. Also as discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2006, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for, and
discloses, pensions and other postretirement benefits.  A companys
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts February27, 2008

60 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Consolidation and ClassificationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Raytheon Company and all wholly-owned and majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All intercompany
transactions have been eliminated. For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year. As discussed in Note 2,
Discontinued Operations, all periods presented have been reclassified to reflect Raytheon Aircraft and Flight Options as discontinued operations as a result of the sales of these businesses on March26, 2007 and November30, 2007,
respectively. In addition, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. As used in these notes, the terms we, us, our, Raytheon and the
Company mean Raytheon Company and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates another meaning.  Use of EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles GAAP which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events
that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results
could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our financial statements.  Revenue RecognitionWe account for our contracts associated with the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex aerospace or electronic equipment and related services, or those otherwise
within the scope of Chapter 11 of Accounting Research Bulletin No43, Government Contracts ARB No43 or Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts SOP 81-1, such
as certain cost-plus service contracts, using the percentage-of-completion accounting method. Under this method, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the long-term contract. We combine closely related contracts
when all the applicable criteria under SOP 81-1 are met. Similarly, we may segment a project, which may consist of a single contract or a group of contracts, with varying rates of profitability, only if all the applicable criteria under SOP 81-1 are
met.  We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for all of our
long-term contracts unless we believe another method more clearly measures progress towards completion of the contract. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs
incurred-to-date to the total estimated costs at completion of the contract. Revenues, including estimated earned fees or profits, are recorded as costs are incurred. Incentive and award fees which are generally awarded at the discretion of the
customer, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating profit rates. Estimates of award fees are based on actual awards and anticipated performance. Incentive provisions which increase or decrease earnings based
solely on a single significant event are generally not recognized until the event occurs. Such incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Our claims on contracts are recorded
only if it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and the amounts can be reliably estimated.  Changes in estimates of contract sales, costs and profits are recognized using a cumulative catch-up, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the
changes on current and prior periods. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue
to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period the loss is determined.  To a much lesser extent, we also enter into contracts that are not associated with the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex aerospace or
electronic equipment and related services, or not otherwise within the scope of ARB No43 or SOP 81-1. We account for those contracts in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No104,
Revenue Recognition SAB 104, or other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature. Revenue under such contracts is generally recognized upon delivery or as the service is performed. Revenue on contracts to sell software is recognized in
accordance with the requirements of Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. Revenue from non-software license fees is recognized over the expected life of the continued involvement with the customer. Royalty revenue is recognized
when earned. Revenue generated from fixed price service contracts not associated with the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex aerospace or electronic 
61 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
equipment is recognized as services are rendered once persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, our price is fixed or determinable, and we have
determined that collectibility is reasonably assured.  We apply the separation
guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables EITF 00-21 for contracts with multiple deliverables. Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables
should be divided into more than one unit of accounting. For contracts with more than one unit of accounting, we recognize revenue for each deliverable based on the revenue recognition policies discussed above.  Research and Development ExpensesExpenditures for Company-sponsored research and
development projects and bid and proposal costs are expensed as incurred. Customer-sponsored research and development projects performed under contracts are accounted for as contract costs as the work is performed.  Federal, Foreign and State Income TaxesThe Company and our domestic subsidiaries
provide for federal income taxes on pretax accounting income at rates in effect under existing tax law. Foreign subsidiaries record provisions for income taxes at applicable foreign tax rates in a similar manner. The payments made for state income
taxes are included in administrative and selling expenses as these costs can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government in the period in which the tax is payable. Accordingly, the state income tax
provision benefit is allocated to contracts in future periods as discussed below in Deferred Contract Costs.  Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase.  Allowance for Doubtful AccountsWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to
provide for the estimated amount of accounts receivable that will not be collected. The allowance is based upon an assessment of customer credit-worthiness, historical payment experience, the age of outstanding receivables and collateral to the
extent applicable.  Activity related to the allowance for doubtful accounts was
as follows:  In millions Balance at December31, 2004 28 Provisions 2 Utilizations 11 Balance at December31, 2005 19 Provisions Utilizations 1 Balance at December31, 2006 18 Provisions Utilizations 10 Balance at December31, 2007 8
Contracts in
ProcessContracts in process are stated at cost plus estimated profit, but not in excess of estimated realizable value.  Deferred Contract CostsCertain costs incurred in the performance of our U.S. government contracts are required to be recorded under GAAP but are not
currently allocable to contracts. Such costs are deferred and primarily include a portion of our environmental expenses, asset retirement obligations, certain restructuring costs, deferred state income tax and workers compensation. At
December31, 2007 and December31, 2006, the net deferred contract costs were approximately $80 million and $40 million, respectively. These costs are allocated to contracts when they are paid or 
62 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
otherwise agreed. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs. This assessment requires us to make assumptions about the extent of cost
recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity. If the level of backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected.
Pension and other postretirement costs are allocated to our contracts as
allowed costs based upon the U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards CAS. The CAS requirements for pension and other postretirement costs differ from the financial accounting standards FAS requirements under U.S. GAAP. Given the inherent
difficulty in matching individual expense and income items between the CAS and FAS requirements to determine specific recoverability, we have not estimated the incremental FAS expense to be recoverable under our expected future contract activity,
and therefore have not deferred any FAS expense for pension and other postretirement plans in 2005-2007. This resulted in $259 million, $362 million and $448 million of incremental expense reflected in our results of operations for 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively, for the difference between CAS and FAS requirements for our pension plans in those years.  InventoriesInventories are stated at cost first-in, first-out or average cost, but not in excess of realizable value. A provision for excess or inactive inventory is recorded based upon an analysis that
considers current inventory levels, historical usage patterns, future sales expectations and salvage value.  Property, Plant and Equipment, NetProperty, plant and equipment, net are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major improvements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance, repairs and
minor improvements are expensed. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income. Gains and
losses resulting from the sale of plant and equipment at the government and defense businesses are included in overhead and reflected in the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government.  Provisions for depreciation are generally computed using a combination of accelerated and
straight-line methods. Depreciation provisions are based on estimated useful lives as follows: buildings20 to 45 years, machinery and equipment3 to 10 years and equipment leased to others5 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the lesser of the remaining life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement.  Impairment of Goodwill and Long-lived AssetsWe comply with the provisions of Statement of Financial Standards No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS No. 142, which requires that we
evaluate our goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of that goodwill may not be recoverable. We perform our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter utilizing a two-step
methodology that requires us to first identify potential goodwill impairment and then measure the amount of the related goodwill impairment loss, if any. We have identified our operating segments as reporting units under the impairment test
assessment criteria outlined in SFAS No. 142. In performing our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2007 and 2006, we did not identify any goodwill impairment associated with our continuing operations.  In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No144, Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, we determine whether long-lived assets are to be held for use or held for disposal. Upon indication of possible impairment, we evaluate the recoverability of held for use long-lived assets by
measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows. When an evaluation indicates that the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset, the asset
is adjusted to its estimated fair value. In order for long-lived assets to be considered held for disposal, we must have committed to a plan to dispose of the assets. Once deemed held for disposal, the assets are stated at the lower of the carrying
amount or fair value.  Computer SoftwareInternal use computer
software, which consists primarily of an integrated financial package, is stated at cost less accumulated amortization and is amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life, generally 10 years. 
63 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
Advance Payments and Billings in Excess of Costs IncurredWe receive advances, performance-based payments
and progress payments from customers which may exceed costs incurred on certain contracts. We classify advance payments and billings in excess of costs incurred, other than those reflected as a reduction of contracts in process, as current
liabilities.  Product WarrantyWe provide for product warranties in
conjunction with certain product sales where revenue is recognized upon delivery.  Activity related to warranty accruals was as follows:  In millions Balance at December31, 2004 28 Provisions for warranties in 2005 15 Warranty services provided in 2005 12 Balance at December31, 2005 31 Provisions for warranties in 2006 17 Warranty services provided in 2006 12 Balance at December31, 2006 36 Provisions for warranties in 2007 20 Warranty services provided in 2007 9 Balance at December31, 2007 47
Costs incurred under warranty
provisions performed under long-term contracts using the cost-to-cost measure of progress are accounted for as contract costs and are excluded from the table above, as the estimation of these costs is an integral part of the determination of the
pricing of these long-term contracts.  Comprehensive
IncomeComprehensive income and its components are presented in the statement of stockholders equity.  Accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of the following at December31:  In millions
2007 2006 Unfunded projected benefit obligation1 2,097 2,607 Foreign exchange translation 118 67 Cash flow hedges2 21 24 Unrealized gains on interest-only strips 3 3 Interest rate lock 1 1 Total 1,956 2,514 1
Includes $98 million, net of tax benefits of $52 million, in 2006 related to Raytheon Aircraft. 2
Includes $20 million, net of tax liabilities of $11 million, in 2006 related to Raytheon Aircraft.  The unfunded projected benefit obligation is shown net of tax benefits of $1,129 million and $1,403 million at December31, 2007 and
2006, respectively. The cash flow hedges are shown net of tax liabilities of $11 million and $13 million at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The unrealized gains on interest-only strips are shown net of tax liabilities of $2 million at
December31, 2007 and 2006. The interest rate lock is shown net of tax benefits of $1 million at December31, 2007 and 2006.  Translation of Foreign CurrenciesAssets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at current exchange rates and the effects of these translation
adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity. Deferred taxes are not recognized for translation-related temporary differences of foreign subsidiaries as their undistributed
earnings are considered to be permanently invested. Income and 
64 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
expenses in foreign currencies are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses in 2007, 2006 and
2005 were not material.  Pension CostsWe have several pension and
postretirement benefit plans covering the majority of employees, including certain employees in foreign countries. Annual charges to income are made for the cost of the plans, including current service costs, interest on projected benefit
obligations and net amortization and deferrals, increased or reduced by the return on assets. We are required to fund annually, at a minimum, those pension costs which are calculated in accordance with Internal Revenue Service regulations and
standards issued by the Cost Accounting Standards Board.  For purposes of
determining Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No87, Employers Accounting for Pensions SFAS No87 pension expense, investment gains and losses are spread over 3 years to develop a market-related value of the assets.
We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No158,
Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No87, 88, 106 and 132R SFAS No158 as of December31, 2006. SFAS No158 requires us to recognize the
funded status of a postretirement benefit plan defined benefit pension and other benefits as an asset or liability on our balance sheet. Funded status represents the difference between the projected benefit obligation of the plan and the market
value of the plans assets. Previously unrecognized deferred amounts such as demographic or asset gains or losses and the impact of historical plan changes are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Changes in these amounts
in future years are adjusted as they occur through accumulated other comprehensive income loss. These amounts will be amortized and included in future pension expense over the average employee service period.  The adoption of SFAS No158 resulted in a $19 billion increase from $23 billion to
$42 billion in accrued retiree benefits and other long-term liabilities and a corresponding $13 billion decrease, net of taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity. In addition, the intangible asset of
$128 million previously established under SFAS No87 was eliminated. In accordance with SFAS No158, prior periods have not been restated.  Interest Rate and Foreign Currency ContractsWe meet our working capital requirements with a combination of variable rate short-term and fixed rate long-term
financing. We enter into interest rate swap agreements or interest rate locks with commercial and investment banks to manage interest rates associated with our financing arrangements. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts with
commercial banks to fix the dollar value of specific commitments and payments to international vendors and the value of foreign currency denominated receipts. The hedges used by us are transaction driven and are directly related to a particular
asset, liability or transaction for which a commitment is in place. These instruments are executed with credit-worthy institutions and the majority of the foreign currencies are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We do not hold
or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  Fair
Value of Financial InstrumentsThe estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash, cash equivalents and short-term debt approximates the carrying value due to their short maturities and varying interest rates. The
estimated fair value of notes receivable approximates the carrying value based principally on the underlying interest rates and terms, maturities, collateral and credit status of the receivables. The estimated fair value of investments, other than
those accounted for under the cost or equity method, are based on quoted market prices. The estimated fair value of long-term debt of approximately $24 billion at December31, 2007 was based on quoted market prices.  Estimated fair values for financial instruments are based on pricing models using current
market information. The amounts realized upon settlement of these financial instruments will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.  Employee Stock PlansStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the calculated fair value of the
award. The expense is recognized over the employees requisite service period, generally the vesting period of the award. The related excess tax benefit received upon exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock, if 
65 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
any, is reflected in the statement of cash flows as a financing activity rather than an operating activity. In connection with the implementation of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R SFAS No123R, on January1, 2006, we elected the short-cut method in determining our additional paid-in capital pool of windfall benefits and the graded vesting method to
amortize compensation expense over the service period for our restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards and the straight line amortization method for our Long Term Performance Plan LTPP.  Prior to the adoption of SFAS No123R, we accounted for stock options to employees in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations APB No25. We also provided the disclosures required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No123, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosures SFAS No148. As a
result, no expense was reflected in 2005 for stock options, as all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. However, stock-based compensation expense was recognized for
restricted stock awards and the LTPP awards.  Accounting
StandardsIn September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS No157. SFAS No157 establishes a framework for
measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. This accounting standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. However, in January 2008, the
FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 157-b, Effective Date of FASB Statement No157 FSP FAS 157-b. This FSP permits entities to elect to defer the effective date of SFAS No157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities,
except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We have elected to defer the adoption of SFAS No157 for those assets and liabilities included in FSP FAS 157-b. The adoption of SFAS
No157 will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.  In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement No115
SFAS No159. SFAS No159 permits entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible items at fair value the fair value option. A business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for
which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting period. This accounting standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS
No159 will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.  In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No141 revised 2007, Business Combinations SFAS No141R. SFAS No141R replaces SFAS No141, Business
Combinations. SFAS No141R requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; requires certain contingent assets and liabilities acquired to
be recognized at their fair values on the acquisition date; requires contingent consideration to be recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date and changes in the fair value to be recognized in earnings until settled; requires the expensing
of most transaction and restructuring costs; and generally requires the reversals of valuation allowances related to acquired deferred tax assets and changes to acquired income tax uncertainties to also be recognized in earnings. This accounting
standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS No141R to determine the potential impact, if any, the adoption will have on
our financial position and results of operations.  In December 2007, the FASB
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No51 SFAS No160. SFAS No160 requires the ownership interests in subsidiaries
held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate from the parents equity. This standard also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable
to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income. This accounting standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS No160 to determine the potential impact, if any, the adoption will have on our financial position and results of operations.

Risks and UncertaintiesWe provide a wide range of technologically advanced products, services and
solutions for principally governmental customers in the U.S. and abroad, and are subject to certain business risks specific to that industry. Sales to the government may be affected by changes in procurement policies, budget considerations, changing
concepts of national defense, political developments abroad and other factors.  Our consolidated financial statements are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial
statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such
differences may be material to our financial statements.  Note 2: Discontinued

No interest expense was allocated to
discontinued operations for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 since there was no debt specifically attributable to discontinued operations or required to be repaid with proceeds from the sales.  Raytheon AircraftIn 2007, we completed the sale of Raytheon Aircraft to Hawker
Beechcraft Inc., a new company formed by GS Capital Partners, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs, and Onex Partners, for $3,318 million in gross proceeds, which resulted in net proceeds of $3,117 million. The primary difference between the gross and net
proceeds was a $131 million final purchase price adjustment for cash retained by us through the closing of the transaction. We recorded a gain on sale in 2007 of $986 million, net of $612 million of federal, foreign and state taxes. We retained
certain assets and liabilities of Raytheon Aircraft after the sale. At December31, 2007, $61 million was included in non-current assets related to a residual interest in certain receivables sold by Raytheon Aircraft through 2006 and $32
million was included in current liabilities related to certain environmental and product liabilities. Any future income statement and cash flow activity related to these retained assets and liabilities will be included in discontinued operations. We
also retained certain U.K. pension assets and obligations for a limited number of U.K. pension plan participants. The related pension assets and obligations are included in our pension disclosures.  The income from discontinued operations related to Raytheon Aircraft was as follows:

the subsequent sale in November 2007, we recorded charges in the third and fourth quarters of 2007 totaling $157 million pretax, $113 million after-tax. These charges are included in discontinued operations and described in further detail below. In
connection with the sale, we recorded a note receivable for $9 million and retained certain liabilities, primarily consisting of aircraft lease obligations of $23 million. Any future income statement and cash flow activity related to these retained
liabilities will be included in discontinued operations.  The loss from

Total assets consisted primarily of
inventories of $111 million, prepaid expenses and other current assets of $131 million, property, plant and equipment, net of $106 million and other assets, net of $171 million at December31, 2006. Total liabilities consisted primarily of
advance payments and billings in excess of costs incurred of $77 million, accrued expenses of $150 million and accrued retiree benefits and other long-term liabilities of $179 million at December31, 2006.  In the third quarter of 2007 in connection with our on-going evaluation of our long-term
strategy regarding FO, we sought and received a number of initial bids to purchase the business. These initial bids were below our previous 
68 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
estimates of FOs fair value, which was based upon its projected discounted cash flows. As a result of receiving these external indications of market
value and other conditions and events that occurred during the third quarter of 2007, we evaluated whether FOs long-lived assets and its goodwill were impaired. We used the held in use asset recovery model for this evaluation since all the
criteria to meet the held for sale accounting treatment had not been met at the end of the third quarter. Based on the results of this analysis, we recorded an impairment charge in the third quarter of 2007 of $84 million pretax, $69 million
after-tax, which included all of FOs remaining goodwill and a portion of its other intangible assets.  In the fourth quarter of 2007, when our Board of Directors approved the sale of FO and we met the held for sale criteria, we recorded a loss on sale of $73 million pretax, $44 million after-tax. This additional charge
was not recorded until the held for sale accounting treatment was met, as the carrying value of the individual underlying long-lived assets was less than or equal to their estimated fair value at the end of the third quarter of 2007.  In 2006 and 2005, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $55 million pretax, $48 million
after-tax and $22 million pretax, $19 million after-tax, respectively. The goodwill impairment charges in 2006 and 2005 were based upon our determination that the fair value of the business was not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the
assets, including goodwill. We estimated the fair value of FO using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the respective FO long-range plan and the financial objectives therein. This methodology involved significant judgment regarding
FOs projected future cash flows and expected market conditions, and their impact on the selection of the discount rate used in estimating the fair value of FO. The 2005 impairment charge was driven by a downturn revision of FOs then
current long-range plan as a result of 2005 performance, changes in valuation assumptions and the increase in goodwill as a result of the acquisition of the minority shares. In 2006, FOs cash flows and financial results improved over 2005;
however, during 2006 and, in particular, in the fourth quarter, certain unexpected events occurred and conditions arose which negatively impacted the estimated value of the business. In the fourth quarter, FO experienced a significant increase in
competition in its fractional share business and its sales forecast became more difficult to predict as a result of the acceleration of a continued shift in customer demand from fractional shares to the less predictable membership card program.
During 2006, the business was also negatively affected by the notification of a potential federal excise tax audit and the pilots vote to be represented by a union. As a result of these factors, we increased the discount rate used in
determining FOs value from 11% in 2005 to 13% in 2006, which reduced the estimated fair value of FO.  The Internal Revenue Service is currently conducting a federal excise tax audit at FO, related to the treatment of certain FO customer fees and charges. We believe that an unfavorable outcome is not probable because,
among other reasons, there is a reasonable basis for our position that federal excise tax does not apply to management fees charged to FOs customers and such position is consistent with industry practice. Nevertheless, the ultimate resolution
of this matter is uncertain and difficult to predict and an unfavorable outcome could have a material effect on our results of discontinued operations. We have retained this and other tax obligations incurred prior to the sale of FO.  Other Discontinued OperationsIn 2000, we sold Raytheon Engineers
Constructors REC to Washington Group International, Inc. WGI. As a result of WGIs bankruptcy, we were required to perform various contract and lease obligations under letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees Support Agreements
that it had provided to project owners and other parties. We have since settled many of those Support Agreement obligations. For the remaining Support Agreement obligations, we have various risks and exposures, including warranty close out, various
liquidated damages issues and potential adverse claims resolution. In 2005, we recorded an after-tax charge of $23 million for an estimated liability for foreign tax-related matters.  In 2002, we sold Aircraft Integration Systems AIS for $1,123 million, net, subject to purchase price adjustments. As part of the
transaction, we retained the responsibility for performance of the Boeing Business Jet BBJ program and retained certain assets related to the BBJ program, which is now essentially complete. In January 2006, a dispute regarding the AIS purchase
price was resolved in arbitration and we recorded a pretax charge of $26 million in 2005 related to this settlement. In the first quarter of 2006, all liabilities related to the purchase price dispute were discharged.  Other accrued expenses included net current liabilities for REC and AIS of $23 million
and $25 million at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

NOTE 3: Acquisitions In
2007, we acquired Oakley Networks, Inc. and the robotics technologies and capabilities of Sarcos for an aggregate of $211 million in cash. We recorded $38 million in intangible assets, primarily related to completed technology and customer
relationships with a weighted-average life of 6 years and $165 million of goodwill in connection with these acquisitions.  In 2006, we acquired Virtual Technology Corporation and Houston Associates, Inc. for an aggregate of $87 million in cash. We recorded $18 million in intangible assets and
$60 million in goodwill in connection with these acquisitions.  In 2005, we
acquired UTD, Inc. for $39 million in cash. We recorded $2 million in intangible assets and $36 million of goodwill in connection to this transaction. Also in 2005, we paid the third and final installment of $60 million related to the 2003
acquisition of Solypsis Corporation.  Pro forma financial information has not
been provided for these acquisitions as they are not material either individually or in the aggregate.  We funded each of the above acquisitions using cash on hand. The operating results of these businesses have been included with our results as of the respective closing dates of the acquisitions. The purchase price of
these businesses has been allocated to the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. We completed these acquisitions to enhance our technology portfolio. The goodwill
that is tax-deductible related to these acquisitions is $109 million.  NOTE 4:

Long-term receivables included commuter aircraft receivables related to our residual commuter aircraft portfolio in
which the underlying aircraft serve as collateral of $127 million and $155 million at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We maintain reserves for estimated uncollectible aircraft-related long-term receivables. The balance of these
reserves was $2 million and $14 million at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reserves for estimated uncollectible aircraft-related long-term receivables represent our current estimate of future losses.  We accrue interest, generally at rates between 60% and 95%, on aircraft-related long-term
receivables in accordance with the terms of the underlying notes. When an aircraft-related long-term receivable is over 90 days past due, we generally stop accruing interest. At December31, 2007 and 2006, there were no aircraft-related
long-term receivables on which we were not accruing interest.  In 2006 and
2005, we sold $64 million and $18 million, respectively, of general aviation finance receivables without any continuing involvement.  In 2006, we sold an undivided interest of general aviation finance receivables, while retaining a subordinated interest in and servicing rights to the receivables. We
received proceeds of $67 million and recognized a gain of $1 million. We irrevocably, and without recourse, transferred the receivables to the qualifying special purpose entity QSPE, formed in 2003, which in turn, issued beneficial interests in
these receivables to a commercial paper conduit. The transaction involves a third party guarantee of the conduit investment. The assets of the QSPE are not available to pay the claims of the Company or any other entity. We retained a subordinated
interest in the receivables sold of approximately 3%. The conduit obtained the funds to purchase the interest in the receivables, other than the retained interest, by selling commercial paper to third-party investors. We retained responsibility for
the collection and administration of receivables. We continue to service the sold receivables and charge the third party conduit a monthly servicing fee at market rates. 
We accounted for the sale under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishment of Liabilities. The gain was determined at the date of transfer based upon the relative fair value of the assets sold and the interests retained. We estimated the fair value at the date of transfer and at December31, 2007 and
2006 based on the present value of future expected cash flows using certain key assumptions, including collection period and a discount rate of 73%, 70% and 68%, respectively. At December31, 2007, a 10% and 20% adverse change in the
collection period and discount rate would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.  At December31, 2007 and 2006, the outstanding balance of securitized accounts receivable held by the third party conduit totaled $135 million and $173 million,
respectively, of which our subordinated retained interest was $60 million, net and the fair value of the servicing liability was $1 million in both years.  Computer software amortization expense was $75 million, $70 million and $66 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is expected to approximate $75 million for
each of the next five years. Accumulated amortization of computer software was $422 million and $356 million at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
Other intangible assets subject to amortization, which are included in other noncurrent assets in the table above, consisted primarily of drawings and intellectual
property totaling $78 million, net of $49 million of accumulated amortization, at December31, 2007 and $45 million, net of $37 million of accumulated amortization, at December31, 2006. Amortization expense for these intangible assets was
$9 million, $7 million and $7 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is expected to approximate $10 million for each of the next five years.

general, we record our share of the income or loss in our equity method investments as a component of cost of sales.  In addition, we have entered into certain joint ventures formed specifically to facilitate a teaming arrangement between two contractors for the benefit of the customer,
generally the U.S. government, whereby we receive a subcontract from the joint venture in the joint ventures capacity as prime contractor. Accordingly, we record the work we perform for the joint venture as an operating activity. 
In 2001, we formed a joint venture, Thales-Raytheon Systems Co. Ltd. TRS, which we
account for using the equity method. TRS is a system of systems integrator and provides fully customized solutions through the integration of command and control centers, radars and communication networks. TRS has two major operating subsidiaries,
one of which, Thales-Raytheon Systems Co. LLC TRS LLC, we control and consolidate. The minority interest on TRS LLC is reflected as a component of cost of sales. Amounts included in cost of sales were $53 million, $46 million and $20 million in
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Of the $165 million investment in TRS, $127 million represents undistributed earnings at December31, 2007.  Note 8: Notes Payable and Long-term Debt Notes

credit facility under which we can draw down on lines of credit and use the credit facility to support letters of credit and commercial paper that we may issue for short-term liquidity. The credit facility matures in March 2010. Borrowings under the
credit facility bear interest based on LIBOR. As of December31, 2007 and December31, 2006, there were no borrowings under the credit facility. We had, however, approximately $60 million and $70 million of outstanding letters of credit at
December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which effectively reduced our borrowing capacity under the credit facility by that same amount at each of the respective dates.  Under the credit facility, we must comply with certain covenants, including the ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no more than
50% and the ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense, for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, of no less than 30 to 10. We were in compliance
with the covenants during 2007 and 2006, and expect to continue to be in compliance throughout 2008.  Certain of our foreign subsidiaries maintain revolving bank lines of credit to provide them with a limited amount of short-term liquidity. In 2005, Raytheon United Kingdom Limited, a U.K. subsidiary, entered into a
$150 million committed multicurrency revolving credit facility. There were no borrowings under the facility at December31, 2007 and at December31, 2006. In addition, other uncommitted bank lines totaled approximately $15 million at
December31, 2007 and 2006. There were no amounts outstanding under these lines of credit at December31, 2007 and 2006. Compensating balance arrangements are not material.  Total cash paid for interest on notes payable and long-term debt was $232 million, $273 million and $310 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

Note 9: Equity Security Units In 2001, we issued 17,250,000, 825%, $50 par value equity security units. Each equity security unit consisted of a contract to purchase shares of our common stock on May15, 2004 and a mandatorily redeemable equity security with a
stated liquidation amount of $50 due on May15, 2006. The mandatorily redeemable equity security represented preferred stock of RC Trust I RCTI, a subsidiary of the Company that initially issued this preferred stock to the Company in exchange
for a subordinated note. The subordinated notes had the same terms as the mandatorily redeemable equity security and represented an undivided interest in the assets of RCTI whose assets consisted solely of subordinated notes issued by the Company.
In 2004, in accordance with the terms of the equity security units, we issued
270million shares of common stock and received proceeds of $863 million. In 2004, subordinated notes with a par value of $481 million were repurchased at a loss of $32 million pretax, which was included in other expense income, net. In
2006, $408 million of subordinated notes payable matured, which consisted of a payment of $382 million and a reduction in our investment in RCTI of $26 million. The contract required a quarterly distribution, which was recorded as a reduction to
additional paid-in capital, of 125%per year of the stated amount of $50 per purchase contract. The subordinated notes paid a quarterly distribution, which was included in interest expense, of 70%per year. Cash paid for the quarterly
distribution on the subordinated notes was $27 million in 2005.  Note 10:

On November30, 2004, our Board
of Directors authorized the repurchase, between January1, 2005 and December31, 2006, of up to $700 million of our common stock. This program was completed during 2006. In March 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up
to an additional $750 million of our outstanding common stock commencing in 2006. In December 2006, our Board of Directors, subject to the closing of our sale of Raytheon Aircraft, authorized an increase to our existing repurchase program of up to
an additional $750 million of our outstanding common stock to our existing repurchase program. These programs were completed in 2007. In October 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $20 billion of our
outstanding common stock. There was $18 billion available under this program at December31, 2007.  Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution using the treasury stock method that could
occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity.

Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $001 par value per share, in multiple series with terms as determined by our
Board of Directors. There were no shares of preferred stock outstanding at December31, 2007 and December31, 2006.  In June 2006, we issued 12,025,662 warrants to purchase our common stock, of which 12,015,331 were outstanding at December31, 2007, in connection with our
settlement of a class action lawsuit. These warrants were issued with an exercise price of $3750 per share and have been included in the calculation of diluted shares.

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.  In 2007, 2006 and 2005, domestic income before taxes was $2,115 million, $1,735 million and
$1,290 million, respectively, and foreign income before taxes was $110 million, $56 million and $76 million, respectively. Income reported for federal and foreign tax purposes differs from pretax income due to differences between U.S. Internal
Revenue Code or foreign tax law requirements and our accounting practices. No provision has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as these earnings have been indefinitely reinvested. Determination of the
amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable. Total federal and foreign cash tax payments were approximately $1,115 million, $375 million and $56 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
During 2007, we settled our federal research credit claim for the years
1984-1990 and certain domestic and Foreign Sales Corporation issues for the years 1989-1997. IRS examinations of our tax returns have been completed through 2002 and IRS examinations of our tax returns for 2003-2005 began in March 2007. We have
protested to the IRS Appeals Division certain proposed adjustments primarily involving benefits under the Foreign Sales Corporation and Extraterritorial Income ETI exclusion regimes for 1998-2002. We are under audit by a number of state tax
authorities. State tax liabilities will be adjusted to account for any changes in federal taxable income for 1989-2002, as well as any adjustments in subsequent years, as those years are ultimately resolved with the IRS.  We apply the principles of FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes FIN 48, when accounting for our various tax positions. While we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position. Accordingly, additional
provisions on federal, foreign and state tax-related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48 on January1,
2007, we recognized a $13 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as a reduction to retained earnings. The balance of the unrecognized tax benefits at adoption, exclusive of interest, was $500
million, of which $409 million would affect earnings if recognized. The balance of the unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2007, exclusive of interest, was $342 million, of which $250 million would affect earnings if recognized. We
recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. As a result, in 2007 we recorded $32 million of gross interest expense, $21 million net of the federal tax benefit, in tax expense. Penalties, if incurred, would also be
recognized as a component of tax expense. At December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, we had approximately $70 million and $60 million of interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits, which, net of the federal tax benefit, was
approximately $45 million and $39 million.  A reconciliation of the beginning
and ending amount of our unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:  In millions Unrecognized tax benefits at January1, 2007 500 Additions based on current year tax positions 63 Reductions based on current year tax positions 1 Additions for prior year tax positions 34 Reductions for prior year tax positions 7 Settlements with taxing authorities 247 Unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2007 342
We do not currently believe it is
reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next 12 months.  The provision for state income tax expense is generally accounted for as a deferred contract cost and included in contracts in process until allocated to our contracts.
These deferred amounts are generally allocated to our contracts when paid or otherwise when agreed as allocable with the U.S. government. State income taxes allocated to contracts was $81 million, $29 million and $8 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, and was included in administrative and selling expenses.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Jobs Creation Act repealed and provided transitional relief for the ETI
regime for transactions after December31, 2004. The Jobs Creation Act also provides a deduction for income derived from qualifying domestic production activities that is phased in over the 2005 2010 period. The deduction is equal to 3%
of qualifying income in 2005 and 2006, 6% in 2007, 2008 and 2009, and 9% thereafter. In addition, the Jobs Creation Act created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing a deduction for
certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations equivalent to 85% of the dividends received. We recorded a $5 million tax expense in 2005 in connection with the repatriation of $110 million pursuant to the Jobs Creation Act.  In December 2006 the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 was enacted. This legislation
retroactively reinstated the research tax credit for 2006. As a result, we recorded a discrete benefit of $6 million in the fourth quarter representing the benefit for the full year. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 also extended and
modified the research tax credit for 2007.  Deferred income taxes consisted of
the following at December31:  In millions

There were $95 million and $3 million
of taxes refundable included in prepaid expenses and other current assets at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Federal tax expense related to discontinued operations was $582 million, $67 million and $27 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.  Note 12: Commitments and Contingencies At December31, 2007, we had commitments under long-term leases requiring annual rentals on a net lease basis as follows:  In millions 2008 292

Rent expense in 2007, 2006 and 2005
was $276 million, $264 million and $246 million, respectively. In the normal course of business, we lease equipment, office buildings and other facilities under leases that include standard escalation clauses for adjusting rent payments to reflect
changes in price indices, as well as renewal options.

information technology function requiring minimum annual payments as follows:  In millions 2008 68

2010 and thereafter  Insurance is purchased from third
parties to cover aggregate liability exposure up to $125 billion. The aircraft product liability reserve, which was not part of our sale of Raytheon Aircraft, was $16 million and $22 million at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We
previously self-insured for losses and expenses for aircraft product liability up to a maximum of $10 million per occurrence and $50 million annually and insurance was purchased from third parties to cover excess aggregate liability exposure from
$50 million to $125 billion as well as the excess liability over $10 million per occurrence.  We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to remediation of various environmental sites. Our estimate of total environmental remediation costs expected to be incurred is $149 million.
Discounted at a weighted-average risk-free rate of 57%, we estimate the liability to be $99 million before U.S. government recovery and had this amount accrued at December31, 2007. A portion of these costs are eligible for future recovery
through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. The recovery of environmental cleanup costs from the U.S. government is considered probable based on government contracting regulations and our long history of receiving
reimbursement for such costs. Accordingly, we have recorded $64 million at December31, 2007 for the estimated future recovery of these costs from the U.S. government, which is included in contracts in process. We lease certain government-owned
properties and are generally not liable for environmental remediation at these sites; therefore, no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements for these costs. Due to the complexity of environmental laws and regulations, the
varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup methods and technologies, the uncertainty of insurance coverage and the unresolved extent of our responsibility, it is difficult to determine the ultimate outcome of these matters, however, any
additional liability is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Environmental remediation costs expected to be incurred are:  In millions 2008 29

We issue guarantees and have banks and
surety companies issue, on our behalf, letters of credit and surety bonds to meet various bid, performance, warranty, retention and advance payment obligations of us or our affiliates. Approximately $261 million, $910 million and $104 million of
these guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds, for which there were stated values, were outstanding at December31, 2007, respectively, and $311 million, $702 million and $120 million were outstanding at December31, 2006,
respectively. These instruments expire on various dates through 2015. Additional guarantees of project performance for which there is no stated value also remain outstanding.  Included in guarantees and letters of credit above was $39 million and $193 million at December31, 2007, respectively and $92 million
and $157 million at December31, 2006, respectively related to our joint venture in Thales-Raytheon Systems Co. Ltd. TRS. 
79 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
We provide these guarantees and letters of credit to TRS and other affiliates to assist these entities in connection
with obtaining financing on more favorable terms, making bids on contracts and performing their contractual obligations. While we expect these entities to satisfy their loans, project performance and other contractual obligations, their failure to
do so may result in a future obligation for us.  Also included in guarantees
and letters of credit above was $85 million and $21 million at December31, 2007, related to discontinued operations. Included in guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds above was $83 million, $92 million and $11 million at
December31, 2006 related to discontinued operations.  Our residual
commuter aircraft portfolio has exposure to outstanding financing arrangements with the aircraft serving as collateral. We have sold aircraft to thinly capitalized companies whose financial condition could be significantly affected by sustained
higher fuel costs, industry consolidation and declining commercial aviation market conditions. At December31, 2007 and December31, 2006, our exposure on commuter aircraft assets held as inventory, collateral on notes or as leased assets,
was approximately $250 million relating to 156 aircraft and approximately $325 million relating to 192 aircraft, respectively. The carrying value of commuter aircraft assets assumes an orderly disposition of these assets, consistent with our
historical experience and strategy to dispose of these residual assets. If we were to dispose of these assets in an other than orderly disposition or sell the business in its entirety, the value realized would likely be less than the carrying value.
In 1997, we provided a first loss guarantee of $133 million on $13 billion of
U.S. Export-Import Bank loans maturing in 2015 to the Brazilian government related to the System for the Vigilance of the Amazon SIVAM program being performed by Network Centric Systems. Loan repayments by the Brazilian government were current
at December31, 2007.  Government contractors are subject to many levels
of audit and investigation. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense and other departments and agencies, the Government Accountability Office, the
Department of Justice and Congressional Committees. The Department of Justice, from time to time, has convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by us. Individually and in the aggregate, these audits and investigations are not
expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  In 2006, Technical Services recorded a profit adjustment related to certain program costs which may be deemed unrecoverable. Although not expected to be material, we may incur additional charges as we continue to
assess and engage in discussions regarding the matter.  In May 2006,
international arbitration hearings commenced against us, as the successor to the Hughes Electronics defense business, in connection with certain claims brought in 2004 relating to an alleged 1995 Workshare Agreement. The asserted claims include
breach of contract, intellectual property infringement and other related claims. The arbitrators liability decision on certain of the claims has been stayed while the parties engage in settlement discussions. The ultimate resolution of this
matter, however, remains uncertain and difficult to predict. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to these claims and intend to continue to contest the claims vigorously. An adverse resolution of this matter could have a material effect on
our results of operations.  In addition, various claims and legal proceedings
generally incidental to the normal course of business are pending or threatened against us. While the ultimate liability or potential range of loss, if any, from these proceedings is presently indeterminable, any additional liability is not expected
to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Note 13: Stock-based Compensation Plans We recorded $109 million, $104 million and $60 million of expense related to stock-based compensation in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We recorded $38 million, $34 million and $21 million as a tax benefit related
to stock-based compensation in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. At December31, 2007, there was $148 million of compensation expense related to nonvested awards not yet recognized which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 15 years.  Shares issued as a result of stock option exercise or
conversion of restricted stock unit awards will be funded through treasury stock or through the issuance of new shares.  Restricted Stock The 2001 Stock Plan provides for the award of restricted stock,
restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights. The 1997 Nonemployee Directors Restricted Stock Plan provides for the award of restricted stock to nonemployee directors. Awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock appreciation
rights generally are made by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors MDCC and are compensatory in nature. These awards vest over a specified period of time as determined by the MDCC, generally 4 years for
employee awards and one year for nonemployee directors. Restricted stock awards entitle the recipient to full dividend and voting rights. Nonvested shares are restricted as to disposition and subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances. The
fair value at the date of award of restricted stock is credited to common stock at par value and the excess is credited to additional paid-in capital. The fair value of restricted stock, calculated under the intrinsic value method at the date of
award, is charged to income as compensation expense over the vesting period with a corresponding credit to additional paid-in capital.  No further grants are allowed under the 2001 Stock Plan or the 1997 Nonemployee Directors Restricted Stock Plan after January30, 2011 and November25, 2011,
respectively.  Restricted stock activity for

Long-Term Performance Plan In 2004, we established the Long-Term Performance Plan LTPP which provides for restricted stock unit awards granted from the 2001 Stock Plan to our senior leadership.
These awards vest when specific pre-established levels of performance are achieved at the end of a three-year performance cycle. 
81 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
The performance goals for the three outstanding performance cycles, which are independent of each other, are based on
the following weighted metrics:  Performance Cycle

Total Shareholder Return, relative to a peer group  The ultimate award, which is determined at the end of each of the three-year performance cycles, can range from zero to 200% of the target award and also includes
dividend equivalents, which are not included in the table below. Compensation expense for the 2005 2007 award is recognized over the performance period based on the intrinsic value method. Compensation expense for the 2007 2009 and
2006 2008 awards is recognized over the performance period based upon the value determined under the intrinsic value method for the free cash flow and ROIC portions of the award and the Monte Carlo simulation method for the TSR portion of the
award. Compensation expense for the Free Cash Flow and ROIC portions of the awards will be adjusted based upon the expected achievement of those performance goals. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No123R on January1, 2006, we recorded
compensation expense in accordance with APB No25.  LTPP activity related

The increase related to expected
performance represents increases to awards based on the expected achievement of performance goals.  Stock Options In 2004, we changed the primary form of our broad-based equity compensation from stock options to restricted
stock. There were no stock options granted in the twelve months ended December31, 2007 or 2006. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No123R, we accounted for stock options to employees in accordance with APB No25. We also provided the
disclosures required under SFAS No123, as amended by SFAS No148. As a result, no expense was reflected in 2005 for stock options, as all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on
the date of grant. However, stock-based compensation expense was recognized for restricted stock awards and the LTPP awards during such periods.

The weighted-average fair value of
each stock option granted in the twelve months ended December31, 2005 was estimated as $844 on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:  2005 Expected life
4years Assumed annual dividend growth rate
5 Expected volatility
30 Assumed annual forfeiture rate
8  The expected life was determined based
upon our prior experience. The expected volatility was determined using the Companys and our peer-groups historic volatility. The risk free interest rate month-end yields on 4-year U.S. Treasury strips equivalent zero coupon at the
time of grant was 36% in 2005. In accordance with SFAS No123R, we began expensing stock options in 2006 based upon the Black-Scholes values determined at the date of grant.  The 2001 Stock Plan provides for the grant of both incentive and nonqualified stock options at an exercise price which is not less than 100%
of the fair value on the date of grant. The 1995 Stock Option Plan provided for the grant of both incentive and nonqualified stock options at an exercise price which is not less than 100% of the fair value on the date of grant. The 1991 Stock Plan
provided for the grant of incentive stock options at an exercise price which was 100% of the fair value on the date of grant and nonqualified stock options at an exercise price which may have been less than the fair value on the date of grant. The

Note 14: Pension and Other Employee Benefits We have pension plans covering the majority of our employees, including certain employees in foreign countries Pension Benefits. In addition to providing pension
benefits, we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to retired employees through other postretirement benefit plans Other Benefits. Substantially all of our U.S. employees may become eligible for the Other Benefits.  We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No158, Employers
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No87, 88, 106 and 132R SFAS No158 as of December31, 2006. SFAS No158 requires us to recognize the funded status of
a postretirement benefit plan defined benefit pension and other benefits as an asset or liability on our balance sheet. Funded status represents the difference between the projected benefit liability obligation of the plan and the market value of
the plans assets. Previously unrecognized deferred amounts such as demographic or asset gains or losses and the impact of historical plan changes are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss under SFAS No158. Changes in
these amounts in future years are adjusted as they occur through accumulated other comprehensive income loss.  The strategic asset allocation of our domestic Pension Benefits and Other Benefits plans is diversified with an average and moderate level of risk consisting of
investments in equity securities including domestic and international equities and our common stock, debt securities, real estate and other areas such as private equity and cash. We seek to produce a return on investment over the long-term
commensurate with levels of investment risk which are prudent and reasonable given the prevailing capital market expectations. Policy range allocations are 35% to 65% for U. S. equity securities, 5% to 30% for international equity securities, 20% to
40% for debt securities, 2% to 7% for real estate and 2% to 17% for other areas. The long-term return on asset assumption for our domestic Pension Benefits and Other Benefits plans for 2008 is 875%. The long-term return on asset assumption for our
domestic Pension Benefits and Other Benefits plans was 875% 
85 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
in 2007, 2006 and 2005. To develop the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumptions, we considered the current level of expected returns on risk
free investments, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the asset classes in which we have invested domestic Pension Benefits and Other Benefits plan assets and the expectations for future returns of each asset class based upon an
active management strategy, which is consistent with our investment profile. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the long-term return on asset assumptions.  The long-term return on asset assumptions for foreign Pension Benefits plans are based on the
asset allocations and the economic environment prevailing in the locations where the Pension Benefits plans reside. Foreign pension assets do not make up a significant portion of the total assets for all of our Pension Benefits plans.  The tables below detail assets by category for our domestic and foreign Pension Benefits and
Other Benefits plans. These assets consist primarily of publicly-traded equity securities and publicly-traded fixed income securities.  Pension Benefits Asset Information

The effect of a 1% increase or
decrease in the assumed health care trend rate for each future year for the aggregate of service cost and interest cost is $1 million or $1 million, respectively, and for the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is $17 million or $15
million, respectively.  The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan
assets for Pension Benefits plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $15,045 million and $12,878 million, respectively, at December31, 2007, and $15,053 million and $11,789 million, respectively, at
December31, 2006.  The accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of
plan assets for Pension Benefits plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $6,304 million and $5,701 million, respectively, at December31, 2007 and $13,318 million and $11,747 million, respectively, at
December31, 2006. The accumulated benefit obligation for all Pension Benefits plans was $14,577 million and $14,483 million at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  We expect total contributions to the Pension Benefits and Other Benefits plans to be approximately $535 million and $30 million,
respectively, in 2008.  The table below reflects the total Pension Benefits
expected to be paid from the plans or from our assets, including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants share of the cost, which is funded by participant contributions. Other Benefits payments reflect our portion only.

We also maintain additional

On December8, 2003, Medicare reform legislation the Medicare Legislation was enacted, providing a Medicare prescription drug benefit
beginning in 2006 and federal subsidies to employers who provide drug coverage to retirees. Since our postretirement benefit programs provide prescription drug benefits to retirees, secondary to Medicare, the legislation does not apply to our plans.
We maintain an employee stock ownership plan ESOP, which includes our 401k
plan defined contribution plan, under which covered employees are allowed to contribute up to a specific percentage of their pay. The Company matches 
89 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
the employees contribution, up to a maximum of generally between 3% and 4% of the employees pay Company Match. Prior to January1, 2005,
the Company Match was made through a contribution to the Company stock fund. Effective January1, 2005, the Company Match was invested in the same way as employee contributions. Total expense for the Company Match was $230 million, $189 million
and $190 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Prior to
January1, 2005, we made an annual contribution to our common stock fund of approximately one-half of one percent of salaries and wages, subject to certain limitations Company Contributions. Effective January1, 2005, we discontinued the
annual contribution to our common stock fund for most U.S. salaried and hourly employees. The contribution for 2005 was made in April 2006. Total expense for the Company Contributions was less than $1 million, $1 million and $25 million and the
number of shares allocated to participant accounts was 9,000, 18,000 and 660,000 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We purchased shares on the open market for the Company Contributions in 2007, 2006 and 2005.  Effective January1, 2007, all eligible newly-hired or rehired employees participate in
a new defined contribution plan in lieu of our existing pension plans, subject to any applicable collective bargaining agreements. The total expense for the Company contributions to this plan in 2007 was $9 million. Our current eligible employees
will continue to participate in our existing pension plans without any changes to level of benefits or payment options.  At December31, 2007, there was $110 billion invested in our defined contribution plan. At December31, 2007, there was $19 billion invested in our common
stock fund, over which there are no restrictions.  Note 15: Business Segment Reporting

90 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
With the sale of Raytheon Aircraft and FO, we have largely exited the commercial aircraft market and all remaining assets and liabilities associated with the
residual commuter aircraft portfolio of Raytheon Airline Aviation Services LLC RAAS, which currently generates only incidental revenues, were transferred to Corporate. 
Also, the composition of Technical Services internal organization was changed to exclude the Media Solutions business, which now reports to
Integrated Defense Systems and Space and Airborne Systems. Media Solutions generated inter-company revenue primarily from Integrated Defense Systems and Space and Airborne Systems in prior periods.  Prior period segment results were revised to reflect these

On June29, 2006 our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $024 per share. As the approval occurred
after the end of the second quarter, the dividend was recorded in the third quarter of 2006. In addition, on September22, 2006 our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $024 per share, which was also recorded in the third
quarter of 2006. Note 17: Financial Instruments At December31, 2007, we recorded forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at their fair value. Unrealized gains of $52 million were included in
non-current assets and unrealized losses of $20 million were included in current liabilities. For forward exchange contracts designated and qualified for hedge accounting, the offset was included in other comprehensive income, net of tax, of which
approximately $19 million of net unrealized gains are expected to be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve months as the underlying transactions mature. Gains and losses resulting from these cash flow hedges offset the foreign exchange gains
and losses on the underlying assets or liabilities being hedged. The maturity dates of the forward exchange contracts outstanding at December31, 2007 extend through 2017. Certain immaterial contracts were not designated as effective hedges and
therefore were included in other expense income, net. The amount charged to other expense related to these contracts was less than $1 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005. 
We enter into interest rate swaps, as described in Note 8, Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt. These interest rate swaps were designated as fair value
hedges. There was no hedge ineffectiveness in 2007, 2006 or 2005.  Major
currencies and the approximate amounts associated with foreign exchange contracts consisted of the following at December31:  2007

Buy amounts represent the U.S. dollar
equivalent of commitments to purchase foreign currencies and sell amounts represent the U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to sell foreign currencies. Foreign exchange contracts that do not involve U.S. dollars have been converted to U.S. dollars
for disclosure purposes.  Foreign currency forward contracts, used to fix the
dollar value of specific commitments and payments to international vendors and the value of foreign currency denominated receipts, have maturities at various dates through 2017 as follows: $917 million in 2008, $181 million in 2009, $59 million in
2010, $46 million in 2011, and $53 million thereafter.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresManagement has conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a 15e and 15d15e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of December31, 2007.  Conclusion of Evaluation Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2007 were effective.  Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur
or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.  Evaluation of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
