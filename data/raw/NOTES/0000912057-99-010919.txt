ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Go2Net, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Go2Net, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1999 and 1998, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive
loss and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
September 30, 1999. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of Go2Net management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Go2Net, Inc. and subsidiaries at September 30, 1999 and 1998, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended September 30, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of
Go2Net, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less at purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company has not
experienced losses on its cash equivalent investments.
INVESTMENTS
Investment securities at September 30, 1999 and 1998 consist of municipal
and corporate debt and equity securities. The Company securities are
classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. Unrealized
holding gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, on available-for-sale
securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component
of other comprehensive income until realized. Realized gains and losses from the
sale of available-for-sale securities are determined on a specific
identification basis.
A decline in the market value of any available-for-sale security below cost
that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in carrying
amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis
for the security is established. Premiums and discounts are amortized or
accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using
the effective interest method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of three to seven
years. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and are amortized over their
useful lives or the lease term, whichever is shorter.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets consist of goodwill, which represents costs in excess of
the fair value of the net assets acquired and identifiable intangibles.
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful lives of three years. The Company assesses the recoverability of
intangible assets by determining whether the amortization of the intangible
balance over its remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future
operating cash flows of the acquired operations. The amount of intangible asset
impairment, if any, is measured based on projected discounted future operating
cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the Company average cost of funds.
The assessment of the recoverability of intangible asset will be impacted if
estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved.
OTHER ASSETS
Other assets consist of the costs associated with licensed technology,
domain names and trademarks and security deposits and are recorded at cost.
Amortization of other assets is recorded using the straight-line method over the
shorter of useful lives, generally one to three years, or the term of the
agreement.
PREMIUM ON WARRANTS
Premiums associated with warrants for common stock are amortized over the
term of the warrant.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial
conditions and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable. The
Company maintains allowances for credit losses and such losses have been within
management expectations.
No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of total revenues during
the years ended September 30, 1999, 1998 and 1997.
The Company is also subject to risks related to the significant balances of
cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments. At September 30,
1999, the Company held shares and warrants of CommTouch common stock
representing approximately 139% of Commtouch outstanding common stock and
shares and warrants of Click2Learn common stock representing approximately
58% of Click2Learn outstanding common stock. If there is a permanent decline
in the value of these securities below cost, the decline will be reported in the
Company statement of operations. The Company remaining portfolio, however,
is diversified and consists primarily of highly rated money market funds and
short and long-term investment-grade securities.

USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The recorded amounts of financial instruments including cash equivalents,
investments, receivables, accounts payable and short-term debt approximate their
fair values at September 30, 1999 and 1998.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company derives its revenue from the sale of advertisements on
short-term contracts, ecommerce fees and license fees.
Advertising revenues are recognized over the period in which the
advertisements are displayed. Deferred revenues result from billings in excess
of recognized revenue relating to contracts.
The Company ecommerce and license revenues are derived principally from
product licensing, set-up, gateway and transaction fees from the use of its
products. The Company also derives revenues from subscriptions and memberships.
All revenues are generally recognized as the related services are performed,
upon product delivery, or over the term of the subscription or membership,
provided that no significant Company obligations remain and collection of the
receivable is probable. In cases where there are significant remaining
obligations, the Company defers such revenue until those obligations are
satisfied. Fees from maintenance and support of the Company products,
including revenues bundled with the initial licensing fees, are deferred and
recognized over the service period.
Barter transactions are recorded at the lower of the estimated fair value of
the goods or services/ advertisements received or the estimated fair value of
the goods or services/advertisements given. Barter revenue was immaterial for
the years ended September 30, 1999 and 1998. Barter revenue represented $163,390
of revenue for the year ended September 30, 1997.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
Costs incurred in the design and development of new products and
enhancements to existing products and Internet technology applications are
charged to expense as incurred.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 86, Accounting for
the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed,
requires capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the
establishment of technological feasibility. Based upon the Company product
development process, technological feasibility is established upon completion of
a working model. Costs incurred by the Company between completion of the working
model and the point at which the product is ready for general release have been
insignificant.

ADVERTISING AND MARKETING EXPENSE
The Company expenses costs associated with advertising and marketing as they
are incurred. Advertising expense was $346,611, $123,369, and $9,717 for 1999,
1998 and 1997, respectively.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for its stock option plans for employees in accordance
with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. As
such, compensation expense related to fixed employee stock options is recorded
only if, on the date of grant, the fair value of the underlying stock exceeded
the exercise price. The Company has adopted the disclosure-only requirements of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, which allows entities to continue to apply the
provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 for transactions with employees and provide pro
forma net income and pro forma earnings per share disclosures as if the
fair-value based method of accounting in SFAS No. 123 had been applied to
employee stock option grants.
NET LOSS PER SHARE
In accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, the Company has
reported both basic and diluted net income per common share for each period
presented. Basic income per share is computed on the basis of the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Diluted
income per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of
common shares plus dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Dilutive
potential common shares are calculated under the treasury stock method.
Securities that could potentially dilute basic income per share consist of
outstanding stock options and convertible preferred stock. As the Company had a
net loss attributable to common shareholders in each of the periods presented,
basic and diluted net loss per share are the same. Dilutive potential securities
outstanding at year-end that were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share included preferred stock convertible into approximately 91
million common shares and options to purchase approximately 106 million common
shares for the year ended September 30, 1999, and options to purchase
approximately 77 million common shares and 25 million common shares for the
years ended September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
On October 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income. SFAS 130 establishes standards for reporting and
presentation of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of
financial statements. Comprehensive income consists of net loss and net
unrealized gains or losses from available-for-sale securities and is presented
in the statements of stockholders' equity and comprehensive loss. The Statement
requires only additional disclosures in the financial statements; it does not
affect the Company financial position or results of operations.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS No. 133 in
June 1998. This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts, and for hedging activities. It requires that an entity
recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet
and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a
derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge. The accounting for changes
in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative
and the resulting designation. SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS 137, is
effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000.
The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company consolidated financial statements.
In March 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued AICPA Statement of
Position 98-1 SOP 98-1 Accounting for the Costs of Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use which is required to be adopted for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1998. SOP 98-1 provides guidance in capitalizing
software that is developed in-house or purchased. The Company does not believe
SOP 98-1 will have a material impact on the Company financial statements.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission released Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 SAB 101 Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements which the Company expects to adopt no later than October 1, 2000.
SAB 101 provides guidance on revenue recognition issues. The Company has not yet
determined the impact, if any, SAB 101 is expected to have on the Company
financial statements.

respectively.
At September 30, 1999, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for
Federal income tax purposes of approximately $57,982,074, which begin to expire
in 2019. This net operating loss carryforward results primarily from deductions
associated with the exercise of nonqualified employee stock options; therefore,
the realization of these carryforwards will result in a credit to stockholders'
equity. The company realized a $2,838,837 benefit through stockholders' equity
in 1999 related to the exercise of stock options.

Issuance. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is initially convertible at
a conversion price of $3306 per share into 9,075,782 shares of Common Stock and
has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. The First Issuance was
consummated concurrently with the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement on
March 15, 1999. Simultaneously with the closing of the first issuance of
preferred stock, the Company and Vulcan entered into a Registration Rights
Agreement, and Vulcan entered into a Management Agreement with each director of
the Company pursuant to which Vulcan agreed to purchase 2,806,624 shares of
Common Stock from the directors of the Company, three of whom are executive
officers of the Company, at a price of $4500 per share. The Second Issuance and
the sale of directors shares was consummated June 17, 1999. On March 19, 1999,
pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Vulcan commenced a tender offer to
purchase 7,193,376 shares of Common Stock for a purchase price of $4500 per
share. The tender offer expired on April 15, 1999 with no shares being tendered.
On the date of the First Issuance March 15, 1999 and Second Issuance
June 17, 1999, the price of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was at a
discount to the price of the common stock into which the preferred stock was
then convertible. The discount of $159,930,733 was recognized as a dividend to
Vulcan.
9% CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK
In November 1996, the holders of all outstanding shares of 9% Cumulative
Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock converted their preferred stock to
3,710,000 shares of the Company common stock.
COMMON STOCK
The Company common stock was split 2-for-1 on February 23, 1999 and
June 24, 1999. The common stock shares and dollars per share included throughout
the financial statements have been restated to reflect the splits.
In April 1997, the Company completed its initial public offering and issued
6,400,000 shares of its common stock to the public at a price of $200 per
share. In May 1997, pursuant to the exercise of an over-allotment option granted
to the underwriters of the Company initial public offering, the Company issued
an additional 960,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $200 per share.
The Company received approximately $128 million of cash, net of underwriting
discounts, commissions and other offering costs.

In 1996, the Board of Directors adopted a Stock Option Plan under which an
aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of common stock were reserved for grants to
employees and members of the Board of Directors and independent contractors.
Options granted under this plan may be designated as incentive or nonqualified
at the discretion of the Plan Administrator. The Company authorized an
additional 6,000,000 shares of common stock in 1999 and 7,000,000 shares of
common stock in 1998 under the Plan increasing total shares under the plan to

employed longer than three months are eligible to participate with the exception
of those owning 5% or more of the combined voting power of the Company stock.

fair value of the common stock on the first or last day of the purchase period
six months. An employee rights under the plan terminate upon voluntary

6. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Pro forma information regarding net loss and loss per share required by SFAS
No. 123 has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee
stock options and stock purchase plan under the fair value method. Under this
method, the weighted-average per share grant date fair value of options granted
in fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997 was, $1192, $441, and $149, respectively, for
the options granted with an exercise price less than fair value at the date of
grant, and $2733, $286, and $135, respectively, for the options granted with
an exercise price equal to fair market value at the date of grant. The fair
value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions                                YEARS ENDED
