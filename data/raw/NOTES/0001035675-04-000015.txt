Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note A.Business Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 1.About NSTAR NSTAR or the Company is an energy delivery company engaged primarily in the transmission and distribution of energy. NSTAR serves approximately 14 million customers in Massachusetts, including approximately 11 million electric
customers in 81 communities and 03 million gas customers in 51 communities. NSTAR is a public utility holding company generally exempt from the provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. NSTARs retail utility subsidiaries are
Boston Edison Company Boston Edison, Commonwealth Electric Company ComElectric, Cambridge Electric Light Company Cambridge Electric and NSTAR Gas Company NSTAR Gas. Its wholesale electric subsidiary is Canal Electric Company Canal. NSTARs
three retail electric companies operate under the brand name NSTAR Electric. Reference in this report to NSTAR shall mean the registrant NSTAR or one or more of its subsidiaries as the context requires. Reference in this report
to NSTAR Electric shall mean each of Boston Edison, ComElectric and Cambridge Electric. NSTARs non-utility, unregulated operations include district energy operations Advanced Energy Systems, Inc. and NSTAR Steam Corporation,
telecommunications operations NSTAR Communications, Inc. NSTAR Com and a liquefied natural gas service company Hopkinton LNG Corp. 2.Basis of Consolidation and Accounting The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the results of operations, comprehensive income, retained earnings, financial position and cash flows of NSTAR and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current years presentation. NSTARs utility subsidiaries follow accounting policies prescribed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC and the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy MDTE. In addition, NSTAR and its
subsidiaries are subject to the accounting and reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
GAAP. The utility subsidiaries are subject to the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation SFAS 71. The application
of SFAS 71 results in differences in the timing of recognition of certain expenses from that of other businesses and industries. The distribution and transmission businesses remain subject to rate-regulation and continue to meet the criteria for application of
SFAS 71. Refer to Note E to these Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on regulatory assets. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management of NSTAR and its subsidiaries to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 3.Revenues Utility revenues are based on authorized rates approved by the MDTE and FERC. Estimates of distribution and transition revenues for electricity and natural gas delivered to customers but not yet billed are accrued at the end of
each accounting period.
Table of Contents Revenues for NSTARs non-utility subsidiaries are recognized when services are rendered or when the energy is delivered. 4.Utility Plant Utility plant is stated at original cost. The cost of replacements of property units are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs and replacements of minor items are expensed as incurred. The original cost of property
retired, net of salvage value, is charged to accumulated depreciation. The incurred related cost of removal is charged against the Regulatory liability - cost of removal. 5.Non-Utility Plant Non-utility property is stated at cost or its net realizable value. The following is a summary of non-utility property and equipment, at cost less accumulated depreciation, at December 31 in thousands 2003 2002 Land 15,604 15,700 Energy production equipment 132,487 71,333 Telecommunications equipment 38,314 37,856 Gas storage 42,701 42,701 Buildings and improvements 2,992 2,992 232,098 170,582 Less: accumulated depreciation 72,123 68,238 159,975 102,344 Construction work in progress 581 27,574 160,556 129,918 6.Depreciation Depreciation of utility plant is computed on a straight-line basis using composite rates based on the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property. The composite rates are subject to the approval of the MDTE and
FERC. The overall composite depreciation rates for utility property were 304%, 326% and 302% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The rates include a cost of removal component, which is collected from customers. Depreciation of non-utility property is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset. The estimated depreciable service lives in years of the major components of non-utility property and equipment are
as follows Depreciable Plant Component Life Energy production equipment 25-35 Telecommunications equipment 10 Liquefied gas storage facilities 28 Buildings and improvements 40 Depreciation expense on non-utility property and equipment was $39 million and $85 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively. Table of Contents 7.Costs Associated with Issuance and Redemption of Debt and Preferred Stock Consistent with the recovery in utility rates, discounts, redemption premiums and related costs associated with the issuance and redemption of long-term debt and preferred stock are deferred. The costs related to long-term debt
are recognized as an addition to interest expense over the life of the original or replacement debt. Consistent with an accounting order received from the FERC, costs related to preferred stock issuances and redemptions are reflected as a direct reduction to
retained earnings upon redemption or over the average life of the replacement preferred stock series as applicable. 8.Allowance for Borrowed Funds Used During Construction AFUDC/Capitalized Interest AFUDC represents the estimated costs to finance utility plant construction. In accordance with regulatory accounting, AFUDC is included as a cost of utility plant and a reduction of current interest charges. Although AFUDC
is not a current source of cash income, the costs are recovered from customers over the service life of the related plant in the form of increased revenues collected as a result of higher depreciation expense. Average AFUDC rates in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were
160%, 226% and 431%, respectively, and represented only the costs of short-term debt that excludes the impact of capitalized interest. NSTAR capitalizes interest costs on long-term construction projects related to its unregulated businesses. Interest costs aggregating $37 million during 2003 were capitalized for the construction of new combustion turbines at
AES MATEP facility. 9.Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are comprised of liquid securities with maturities of 90 days or less when purchased. Restricted cash primarily represents the remainder of the net proceeds from the sale of Canals
generation assets that are required to be used to reduce the transition costs that otherwise would be billed to customers, funds held by a trustee in connection with Advanced Energy Systems 6924% Note Agreement, and funds held in reserve for a trust on behalf
of Boston Edison to pay the principal and interest on the transition property securitization. 10.Equity Method of Accounting NSTAR uses the equity method of accounting for investments in corporate joint ventures in which it does not have a controlling interest. Under this method, it records as income or loss the proportionate share of the net earnings
or losses of the joint ventures with a corresponding increase or decrease in the carrying value of the investment. The investment is reduced as cash dividends are received. NSTAR participates in several corporate joint ventures in which it has
investments, principally its 145% equity investment in two companies that own and operate transmission facilities to import electricity from the Hydro-Quebec System in Canada, and its equity investments ranging from 4% to 14% in three regional nuclear facilities
that are currently being decommissioned. 11.Goodwill and Costs to Achieve The merger that created NSTAR was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The premium Goodwill associated with the acquisition was approximately $490 million, while the original estimate of transaction and
integration costs to achieve the merger was $111 million. The merger premium is reflected on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as Goodwill. In accordance with the MDTEs settlement agreement, this premium will continue to be amortized
over 40 years and amounts to approximately $122 million annually, while the costs to achieve CTA are being amortized over 10 years. CTA are the costs incurred to execute the
Table of Contents merger including the employee costs for a voluntary severance program, costs of financial advisors, legal costs, and other transaction and systems integration costs. CTA was being amortized at an annual rate of $111 million based
on the original rate plan, as approved by the MDTE through the rate freeze period. Effective upon completion of the four-year rate freeze on August 25, 2003, the amortization expense was increased to reflect the actual CTA expenditures incurred. As a
result, the total CTA amortization expense for 2003 was approximately $129 million, an increase of $18 million from 2002. NSTAR will reconcile the actual CTA costs incurred with the original estimate in a future rate proceeding. This reconciliation will
include a final accounting of the deductibility for income tax purposes of each component of CTA. The total CTA is approximately $143 million. This increase from the original estimate is partially mitigated by the fact that the portion of CTA that is not
deductible for income tax purposes is approximately $20 million lower than the original estimate. NSTAR anticipates that these incremental costs are probable of recovery in future rates. The CTA and Goodwill amounts were filed and approved as part of the
rate plan. 12.Stock Option Plan NSTARs 1997 Share Incentive Plan is a stock-based employee compensation plan and is described more fully in the accompanying Note J to Consolidated Financial Statements. NSTAR applies the recognition and measurement
principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for this plan. No stock-based employee compensation expense for option grants is reflected in net
income, as all options granted under this plan had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if NSTAR had applied the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation to stock-based employee compensation. in thousands, except per share amounts Years ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Net income loss 181,574 161,707 2,426 Add: Share grant incentive compensation expense included in reported net income net of related tax effects 2,147 1,642 1,241 Deduct: Total share grant and stock option compensation expense determined under fair value method for all awards, net of related tax effects 2,870 2,489 1,972 Pro forma net income loss 180,851 160,860 3,157 Earnings loss per share Basic - as reported 342 305 005 Basic - pro forma 341 303 006 Diluted - as reported 340 303 005 Diluted - pro forma 339 302 006 Table of Contents 13.Other Income Deductions, net Major components of other income were as follows Years ended December 31 in thousands 2003 2002 2001 Equity earnings, dividends and other investment income 2,205 2,667 2,258 Gain on demutualized securities 4,928 4,461 Interest and rental income 3,244 5,025 5,829 Tax valuation allowance adjustment 8,485 3,849 Investment tax credit 7,272 Settlement of claims 1,818 Miscellaneous other income, includes applicable income tax expense 463 1,377 7,443 14,397 22,364 6,923 Major components of other deductions were as follows Years ended December 31 in thousands 2003 2002 2001 Shutdown costs of unregulated business 2,000 5,000 Charitable contributions 1,268 1,175 237 Miscellaneous other deductions, includes applicable income tax benefit 470 656 2,210 Minority interest 26 525 1,076 1,712 1,994 1,951 14.New Accounting Standards In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149 Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 149. SFAS 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. SFAS 149 also amends SFAS 133 for implementation issues raised in relation to the application of the definition of a derivative.
SFAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and its provisions are to be applied prospectively. The adoption of SFAS 149 did not have a material effect on NSTARs financial position or results of operations. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150 Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity SFAS 150. This Statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies
and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Statement is intended to improve the accounting for these financial instruments that, under previous guidance, issuers could account for as equity. This
Statement requires that these instruments be classified as liabilities on the balance sheet. NSTAR adopted SFAS 150 effective July 1, 2003. NSTAR assessed the requirements of the Statement and has not identified any financial instruments to which SFAS 150
applies. In addition, NSTAR has not entered into, nor modified, any financial instrument since May 31, 2003. As a result, the implementation of this Statement has not had an impact on NSTARs financial position or results of operations. Table of Contents In June 2003, the Derivatives Implementation Group DIG, a working group of the FASB, issued DIG No. C20, Scope Exceptions: Interpretation of the Meaning of Not Clearly and Closely Related in Paragraph 10b
regarding Contracts with a Price Adjustment Feature, which clarified the interpretation of clearly and closely related contracts that include price adjustments. This interpretation also established transition guidance for those contracts that had
previously met the normal purchases and sales exception under previous guidance but may not meet the scope exception under this interpretation. For NSTAR, the effective date of DIG Issue No. C20 was October 1, 2003. NSTAR has assessed the impact of this
interpretation on its current derivative contracts and has determined that NSTAR will continue to designate these contracts as derivative financial instruments and will mark-to-market their values at each reporting date. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, as amended and revised in December 2003 FIN 46R, which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities
VIEs by business enterprises that are the primary beneficiaries. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or whose equity
investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the enterprise with the majority of the risks or rewards associated with the VIE. Application of this Interpretation is required for all potential
VIEs that are referred to as special-purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003 and, for all other types of entities that are potential VIEs that are not referred to as special purpose entities, the consolidation requirements apply for
periods ending after March 15, 2004. NSTAR has assessed the impact of FIN 46R and has determined that it does not have any VIEs for which NSTAR is the primary beneficiary requiring consolidation of the entity as of December 31, 2003. For all other
types of entities, NSTAR is still assessing the impact that FIN 46R will have on its consolidated financial position. NSTAR has a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary, BEC Funding LLC, established to facilitate the sale and administration of $725 million in notes to a special purpose trust created by two Massachusetts state agencies.
Historically, NSTAR has consolidated this entity. As part of NSTARs assessment of FIN 46R, NSTAR reviewed the substance of this entity to determine if it is still proper to consolidate this entity. Based on its review, NSTAR has concluded that BEC
Funding LLC is a variable entity and should continue to be consolidated by NSTAR. 15.Purchases and Sales Transactions with Independent System Operator - New England ISO-NE During 2001, as part of NSTAR Electrics normal business operations in order to meet its energy obligation to its standard offer customers, NSTAR Electric entered into hourly transactions to purchase or sell energy supply to its
ISO-NE. The NSTAR Electric transactions with the ISO-NE have been treated as the ISO-NE servicing the incremental needs of NSTAR Electric, that is, transactions with ISO-NE associated with the difference between NSTAR Electrics resource needs compared to
NSTAR Electrics resource availability. NSTAR Electric records the net effect of transactions with the ISO-NE as an adjustment to purchased power expense. During 2003 and 2002, NSTAR Electric entered into an agreement whereby all of its energy supply resource entitlements are transferred to an independent energy supplier, following which NSTAR Electric repurchases its energy resource
needs from this independent energy supplier for NSTAR Electrics ultimate sale to its standard offer customers. This transaction has been and will continue to be recorded as a net purchase, similar to those transactions with ISO-NE during 2001. Table of Contents Note B.Earnings Per Common Share Basic earnings per common share EPS is calculated by dividing net income, after deductions for preferred dividends, by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the year. SFAS No. 128, Earnings per
Share, requires the disclosure of diluted EPS. Diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the weighted average common shares is increased to include the number of potential dilutive common shares. Diluted EPS reflects the
impact on shares outstanding of the deferred nonvested shares and stock options granted under the NSTAR Share Incentive Plan. The following table summarizes the reconciling amounts between basic and diluted EPS in thousands, except per share amounts 2003 2002 2001 Net income loss 181,574 161,707 2,426 Basic EPS 342 305 005 Diluted EPS 340 303 005 Weighted average common shares outstanding for basic EPS 53,033 53,033 53,033 Effect of dilutive shares Weighted average dilutive potential common
shares 366 264 183 Weighted average common shares outstanding
for diluted EPS 53,399  53,297 53,216 Note C.Investments - Available for Sale Securities NSTAR classifies its investments in marketable securities as available for sale. As of December 31, 2003, NSTAR did not own any investments in marketable securities. However, as of December 31, 2002, NSTAR owned
approximately 116 million common shares of RCN Corporation RCN. On December 24, 2003, NSTAR exited from its investment in RCN and formally abandoned the 116 million shares of RCN common stock. As a result, NSTAR recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $68 million, or $008 per
share. NSTAR determined that the abandonment at that time was the most tax efficient, cost effective and expedient means to exit its RCN investment. As a result of this abandonment, the investment was written down to $0 as of December 31, 2003. The
cumulative increase in fair value of these shares since December 31, 2002, including the impact of the abandonment charge for these shares, is included in Other comprehensive income, net on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. As of December 31, 2002, the total carrying value of the 116 million RCN common shares, included in Other investments on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, was recorded at its estimated fair value of approximately $61
million, or $053 per share. The fair value of the 116 million shares held increased during 2003 as a result of changes in the market value of RCN common shares. In accordance with its accounting policies, NSTAR continuously evaluated the carrying value of its investment in RCN to assess whether any decline in the market value below its carrying value was deemed to be other than temporary.
Consistent with the performance of the telecommunications sector as a whole, the market value of RCN common shares decreased significantly during the later part of 2000 and continued to decrease through 2002. As a result management determined that this decline
in market value was other-than-temporary and Table of Contents recorded impairment charges in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Note D.Asset Retirement Obligations On January 1, 2003, NSTAR adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143. SFAS 143 establishes accounting and reporting standards for obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. It applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or the normal operation of a long-lived
asset, except for certain obligations under lease arrangements. SFAS 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the
entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon
settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. NSTAR has identified certain immaterial long-lived assets, including obligations under lease and easement arrangements, and has determined that it is legally responsible to remove such property. For its regulated utility businesses, NSTAR has identified legal retirement obligations that are currently not material to its financial statements. The recognition of a potential asset retirement obligation will have no impact on
its earnings. In accordance with SFAS 71, for NSTARs rate-regulated utilities, NSTAR would establish regulatory assets or liabilities to defer any differences between the liabilities established for ratemaking purposes and those recorded as required
under SFAS 143. For NSTARs regulated utility businesses, cost of removal negative net salvage is recognized as a component of depreciation expense in accordance with approved regulatory treatment. Cost of removal was previously included
in accumulated deprecation but is currently reflected as a regulatory liability in conjunction with the adoption of SFAS 143. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the estimated amount of the cost of removal included in regulatory liabilities was approximately $223
million and $234 million, respectively, based on the cost of removal component in current depreciation rates. NSTAR has identified several long-lived assets, in which it has legal obligations to remove such property, for its non-regulated businesses. Based on current information and assumptions, NSTAR, in the first quarter of 2003,
recorded an increase in non-utility plant of approximately $06 million, an asset retirement liability of approximately $1 million and a cumulative effect of adoption after tax, reducing net income by $04 million in 2003. The cumulative effect adjustment is
recorded as part of Depreciation and amortization expense on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Note E.Regulatory Assets Regulatory assets represent costs incurred that are expected to be collected from customers through future rates in accordance with agreements with regulators. These costs are expensed when the corresponding revenues are received
in order to appropriately match revenues and expenses. Table of Contents Regulatory assets consisted of the following December 31 in thousands 2003 2002 Power contracts including Yankee units 799,087 773,922 Retiree benefit costs 340,111 445,041 Regulatory assets - other Generation-related regulatory assets, net 504,594 538,287 Merger costs to achieve 93,112 105,992 Income taxes, net 50,161 50,666 Purchased power costs 31,969 30,375 Redemption premiums 12,340 13,479 Other 23,673 44,115 Total regulatory assets 1,855,047 2,001,877 Under the traditional revenue requirements model, electric and gas rates are based on the cost of providing energy delivery service. Under this model, NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas are subject to certain accounting standards that
are not applicable to other businesses and industries in general. The application of SFAS 71 requires companies to defer the recognition of certain costs when incurred if future rate recovery of these costs is expected. This is applicable to NSTARs
electric and gas distribution and transmission operations. Power contracts The unamortized balance of the estimated costs to close the Connecticut Yankee CY, Yankee Atomic YA and Maine Yankee MY nuclear power plants that are currently being decommissioned was $1333 million at December 31, 2003.
NSTARs liability for CY decommissioning and its recovery end in 2007, for YA in 2010 and for MY in 2008. However, should the actual costs exceed current estimates and anticipated decommissioning dates, NSTAR could have an obligation beyond these periods
that would be fully recoverable. These costs are recovered through NSTAR Electrics transition charge. Refer to Note Q, Commitments and Contingencies, for more discussion. The remaining balance at December 31, 2003 of $6658 million represents the recognition of six purchased power contracts as derivatives and their above-market value and future recovery through NSTAR Electrics transition
charges. Refer to Note F, Derivative Instruments - Power Contracts for further details. Generation-related plant Plant and other regulatory assets related to the divestiture of NSTARs generation business are recovered with a return through the transition charge. This recovery occurs through 2016 for Boston Edison, through 2023 for
ComElectric and through 2011 for Cambridge Electric. This schedule is subject to adjustment by the MDTE. As of December 31, 2003, $4254 million of these generation-related regulatory assets are collateralized with the Transition Property Securitization Certificates held by Boston Edisons subsidiary, BEC Funding, LLC. The
certificates are non-recourse to Boston Edison. Table of Contents Retiree benefit costs The retiree benefit regulatory asset of $3401 million is comprised of the additional minimum pension liability charge required under SFAS 87 $2993 million, $163 million of carrying charges related to the MDTE order, which will be
recovered from customers in 2004, and $131 million of pension and PBOP costs deferred under the MDTE order, which will be amortized over three years beginning in 2004. The remaining balance of $115 million relates to other pension and PBOP costs deferred in
accordance with MDTE directives. These costs are being amortized over periods ranging from two to nine years. Refer to Note I of these Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the MDTE order. Merger costs to achieve An integral part of the merger was the MDTE-approved rate plan of the retail utility subsidiaries of NSTAR. Significant elements of the rate plan include a four-year distribution rate freeze, recovery of the acquisition premium
goodwill over 40 years and recovery of transaction and integration costs costs to achieve over 10 years. Costs to achieve were the costs incurred to execute the merger including costs for a voluntary severance program, costs of financial advisors, legal
costs and other transaction and systems integration costs. These costs are collected from all NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas distribution customers and exclude a return component. These costs have been adjusted since the original recovery began and any
unrecovered costs will be included in each companys next rate case filing. Income taxes, net The principal holder of this regulatory asset is Boston Edison. Approximately $31 million of this regulatory asset balance reflects deferred tax reserve deficiencies that the MDTE has allowed recovery of from ratepayers over a
17-year period. In addition, approximately $39 million in additional Boston Edison deferred tax reserve deficiencies have been recorded in accordance with an MDTE-approved settlement agreement. Offsetting these amounts is approximately $20 million of a
regulatory liability associated with unamortized investment tax credits relating to NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas. Purchased power costs The purchased power costs relate to deferred standard offer service and deferred default service costs. Customers have the option of continuing to buy power from the retail electric distribution businesses at standard offer prices
through February 2005. Since 1998, NSTAR has been allowed to defer the difference between the standard offer and default service revenues and the cost to supply the power, plus carrying costs. Default service is the electricity that is supplied by the
local distribution company when a customer is not receiving power from standard offer service and have not chosen to receive service from a competitive supplier. The market price for standard offer and default service may fluctuate based on the average market
price for power. Amounts collected through standard offer and default service are recovered on a fully reconciling basis. Redemption premiums These amounts reflect the unamortized balance of redemption premiums on Boston Edison Debentures that are amortized and recovered over the life of the respective debentures pursuant to MDTE approval. There is no return recognized
on this balance. Table of Contents Other These amounts primarily consist of deferred transmission costs that are set to be recovered over a subsequent twelve-month period. The deferred costs represent the difference between the level of billed transmission revenues and
the current period costs incurred to provide transmission-related services. Also, included are environmental reserves and response costs that represent the recovery of costs to clean up former gas manufacturing sites over a 7-year period without a return. Note F.Derivative Instruments - Power Contracts NSTAR accounts for its power contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133. The accounting for derivative financial instruments is subject to
change based on the guidance received from the DIG of FASB. The DIG issued No. C15, Scope Exceptions: Normal Purchases and Normal Sales Exception for Option-Type Contracts and Forward Contracts in Electricity on October 10, 2001, which
specifically addressed the interpretation of clearly and closely related contracts that qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception under SFAS 133. The conclusion reached by the DIG was that contracts with a pricing mechanism that is subject to future
adjustment based on a generic index that is not specifically related to the contracted service commodity generally would not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception. NSTAR has six purchased power contracts that contain components with pricing mechanisms that are based on a pricing index, such as the Gross National Product or Consumer Price Index. Although these factors are only applied to
certain ancillary pricing components of these agreements, as required by the interpretation of DIG Issue C15, NSTAR began recording these contracts at fair value on its Consolidated Balance Sheets during 2002. As a result, the recognition of a liability for the
fair value of the above-market portion of these contracts at December 31, 2003 is approximately $666 million and is a component of Deferred credits - Power contracts on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. NSTAR has recorded a corresponding regulatory
asset to reflect the future recovery of the above-market component of these contracts through its transition charge. Therefore, as a result of this regulatory treatment, the recording of these contracts on its accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets does not
result in an earnings impact. NSTAR has other purchased power contracts in which the contract value is significantly above-market. However, these contracts have met the criteria for the normal purchases and sales exception pursuant to SFAS 133 and DIG Issue
C15 and have not been recorded on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The above-market portion of these contracts is currently being recovered through the transition charge. Therefore, NSTAR does not account for these types of capacity and
energy contracts, gas supply contracts, or purchase orders for numerous supply arrangements as derivatives. Note G.Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109. SFAS 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax effects of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. In accordance with SFAS 71 and SFAS 109, net regulatory assets of $502 million and $507 million and corresponding net increases in accumulated deferred income taxes were
recorded as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The regulatory assets represent the additional future revenues to be collected from customers for deferred income taxes.

down of RCN investment federal and state 28  40  573 Effective tax rate 383 336 1020 a.Tax Valuation Allowance SFAS 109 prohibits the recognition of all or a portion of deferred income tax benefits if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. NSTAR had determined that it was more likely than not that a
current or future income tax benefit would not be realized relating to the write-downs of its RCN investment that were recorded in the second and fourth quarters of 2002 and previously in the first quarter of 2001. These write-downs resulted from the
significant declines in the market value of the telecommunications sector, including RCN. As a result of this uncertainty, NSTAR recorded a $776 million tax valuation allowance on the entire tax benefit associated with these write-downs. During 2003 and
2002, as a result of previously unanticipated capital gain transactions, NSTAR recognized $85 million and $39 million, respectively, of this tax benefit. Additionally, based on the Internal Revenue Service IRS review of NSTARs 1999 and 2000 federal income tax returns, NSTAR determined that it was more likely than not that it would ultimately recognize the tax benefits relating
to the incremental operating losses from the joint venture that were allocated to NSTAR. These returns are currently being audited by the IRS as part of their normal review of NSTARs consolidated federal income tax returns. The tax valuation
allowance included reserves related to the tax treatment of these losses through June 19, 2002, the final date of JV loss allocation to NSTAR. Each of the tax returns filed for 1999 through 2001 claimed operating losses. The tax return filed for 2002
claimed the remaining portion of these operating losses. Based on the IRS examining agents review, no adjustment for the years under audit was proposed. This determination was arrived at in the fourth quarter of 2002 and, as a result, NSTAR applied
the treatment of these operating losses for all years on a consistent basis, allowing a reduction to its valuation allowance of approximately $197 million as a reduction to income tax expense included as a component of the write-down of the RCN
investment. On December 24, 2003, NSTAR exited from its investment in RCN and formally abandoned the 116 million shares of RCN common stock. As mentioned above, a tax valuation allowance had been established in a previous year to offset the
potential future tax benefits resulting from write-downs of NSTARs investment in RCN. As a result of the abandonment, the Company will claim an ordinary loss on its 2003 tax return. This treatment results in the Company realizing the benefits
represented by the tax asset recorded on its books that resulted from the previous write-downs of this investment for financial reporting purposes. The requirement for a tax valuation allowance, therefore, no longer exists. As a result, the Company
reduced the remaining valuation allowance from approximately $53 million at December 31, 2002 to zero at December 31, 2003. See a further discussion on this matter in Note Q, Commitments and Contingencies.
Table of Contents b.Tax Gain on Generating Assets The cost of transitioning to retail open access was mitigated, in part, by the sale of Commonwealth Energy Systems COM/Energy now a wholly owned subsidiary of NSTAR non-nuclear generating assets. COM/Energy completed
the sale of substantially all of its non-nuclear generating assets in 1998. Proceeds from the sale of these assets amounted to approximately $4539 million, or 61 times their book value of approximately $742 million. The proceeds from the sale, net of
book value, transaction costs and certain other adjustments amounted to $3586 million and are required to be used for the benefit of COM/Energy customers under MDTE rate setting policies. In this instance, the amount was used to reduce transition costs of
Cambridge Electric and ComElectric related to electric industry restructuring. COM/Energy determined that this transaction was not a taxable event because it did not provide an economic benefit to its shareholders. In order to complete its audit of COM/Energys tax returns for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999, the IRS needed to determine whether this transaction was taxable. The local IRS examining agent filed a Request for Technical Advice
with its National Office on June 5, 2003. On August 28, 2003, NSTAR received a response from the IRS National Office to a Request for Technical Advice, requesting advice as to whether the gain on the sale of the COM/Energy non-nuclear generating assets in 1998 was a taxable
transaction. The Technical Advice Memorandum upheld COM/Energys position. This ruling now completes the audits by the IRS of COM/Energys 1997, 1998 and 1999 federal income tax returns. This decision did not require the Company to make
tax and interest payments to the IRS of approximately $140 million. Note H.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 1.Pension NSTAR sponsors a defined benefit retirement plan the Plan that covers substantially all employees. NSTAR also maintains unfunded supplemental retirement plans for certain management employees. In 2002, the Plan was amended to comply with the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 EGTRRA. EGTRRA, among other things, increased the annual benefits limit for amounts payable from the Plan, increased the
number of rollover options for distributions, and allowed surviving spouses to rollover distributions to their employers plan. This amendment also brought the Plan into conformance with recently issued IRS revenue rulings and regulations that require the
change of the mortality table used for computing lump sum pension distributions and annuity conversions. The Plan uses December 31st for the measurement date to determine its projected benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and net periodic benefit costs for the following year. Table of Contents The changes in benefit obligation and Plan assets were as follows December 31 in thousands 2003 2002 Change in benefit obligation Benefit obligation, beginning of the year 949,646 824,302 Service cost 17,976 15,280 Interest cost 58,826 59,658 Plan participants contributions 72 74 Plan amendments 671 Actuarial loss 4,920 108,037 Additional accrued benefits 15,194 Settlement payments 18,846 21,529 Benefits paid 51,565 52,041 Benefit obligation, end of the year 961,029 949,646 Change in Plan assets Fair value of Plan assets, beginning of the year 665,897 790,704 Actual gain loss on Plan assets, net 150,978 105,578 Employer contribution 82,590 54,267 Plan participants contributions 72 74 Settlement payments 18,846 21,529 Benefits paid 51,565 52,041 Fair value of Plan assets, end of the year 829,126 665,897 The Plans funded status was as follows December 31 in thousands 2003 2002 Funded status 131,903 283,749 Unrecognized actuarial net loss 403,312 523,967 Unrecognized transition obligation 379 980 Unrecognized prior service cost 2,962 2,829 Net amount recognized 268,826 238,369 Amounts recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets consisted of December 31 in thousands 2003 2002 Accrued retirement liability 46,659 198,280 Intangible asset 4,835 6,379 Accumulated other comprehensive income 11,368 4,515 Regulatory asset 299,282 425,755 Net amount recognized 268,826 238,369 The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the supplemental retirement plan with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $34,317,000, $32,176,000 and $0,
respectively, as of December 31, 2003 and $32,154,000, $28,561,000 and $0, respectively, as of December 31, 2002.

NSTARs long-term
rate of return is based on past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held in the Plan. This rate is presented net of both administrative expenses and investment expenses, which have averaged approximately 06% for 2003 and
2002. NSTAR pays both types of expenses for the Plan.

Table of Contents The following indicates the weighted average asset allocation percentage of the fair value of total Plan assets for each major type of Plan asset as of December 31st as well as the Plans target percentages and the

As a result, the 2003 and 2002 asset allocation percentages may not fall within the revised permissible
ranges. Table of Contents The primary investment goal of the Plan is to achieve a total annualized return of 9% before expenses over the long-term and to minimize unsystematic risk so that no single security or class of securities will have a disproportionate
impact on the Plan. Risk is regularly evaluated, compared and benchmarked to plans with a similar investment strategy. Assets are diversified by both asset class i.e., equities, bonds and within asset classes i.e., economic sector,
industry. No more than 6% of an asset managers equity portfolio market value may be invested in one company. The total equity portfolio should be invested in at least 20 different companies in different industries. No more than
50% of the total equity portfolios market value may be invested in one industry sector. Domestic and international fixed income investments are permitted and may include government obligations, corporate bonds, preferred stock, and asset-backed securities. No more than 5% of an investment managers portfolio may be
invested in any one security of an issuer, except the U.S. Government and its agencies. Funded Status NSTARs qualified Plan assets were affected by significant declines in the financial markets from 2000 through 2002. These conditions have impacted the funded status of the Plan at both December 31, 2003 and 2002. As a
result of the negative investment performance and, despite the positive Plan investment performance in 2003, at December 31, 2003 and 2002, the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded Plan assets. Therefore, NSTAR is required to recognize an additional minimum
liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions SFAS 87 and SFAS No. 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. The additional minimum liability results in the
netting of the prepaid pension cost with the additional minimum liability on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under SFAS 87, NSTAR is also required to net its prepaid pension balance. The additional minimum pension liability adjustment, which is equal to the sum of the minimum pension liability and the prepaid pension adjustment, would be
recorded, net of taxes, as a non-cash charge to Other Comprehensive Income OCI on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and would not affect the results of operations. The fair value of Plan assets and the ABO are measured at each
year-end balance sheet date. The minimum liability will be adjusted each year to reflect this measurement. At such time that the Plan assets exceed the ABO, the minimum liability would be reversed. On October 31, 2003, the MDTE approved NSTARs request for a reconciliation rate adjustment mechanism related to pension and PBOP costs. As part of this ruling, NSTAR is allowed to record a regulatory asset in lieu of taking
a charge to OCI for the additional minimum liability adjustment mentioned above. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, NSTAR has recorded a regulatory asset of $321 million and $426 million, respectively. The regulatory asset is shown as part of Deferred
debits in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. NSTAR anticipates contributing approximately $43 million to this Plan in 2004. Table of Contents The estimated future benefit payments for the years after 2003 are as follows in thousands 2004 58,190 2005 59,491 2006 61,173 2007 63,694 2008 66,384 2009 - 2013 387,885 Total 696,817 2.Other Postretirement Benefits NSTAR provides health care and other benefits to retired employees who meet certain age and years of service eligibility requirements. These benefits included health and life insurance coverage and until April 1, 2003,
reimbursement of certain Medicare premiums for certain retirees. Under certain circumstances, eligible retirees are required to make contributions for postretirement benefits. In December 2003, the FASB issued Staff Position FSP 106-1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act. The Act provides
for drug benefits for retirees over the age of 65 under a new Medicare Part D program. For employers like NSTAR, who currently provide retiree medical programs for former employees over the age of 65, there are subsidies available which are inherent in the
Act. The Act entitles these employers to a direct tax-exempt federal subsidy. However, since the effective date of the Act was December 2003 and because most employers have not had time to consider the accounting considerations and that there is no
appropriate accounting guidance for the federal subsidy, the FASB issued this FSP to allow employers a one-time election to defer recognition of the impact of the Act in the employers accounting until formal guidance is issued. NSTAR elected to defer
recognition of the provisions of this Act until further accounting guidance is issued. As a result, the provisions of the Act are not reflected in the following disclosure. The issuance of formal accounting guidance may require a change to previously
reported information. NSTAR is continuing to monitor the impact of the Act. NSTARs other postretirement plans use December 31st for the measurement date to determine its projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and net periodic benefit costs for
the following year.

Table of Contents 3.Savings Plan NSTAR also provides a defined contribution 401k plan for substantially all employees. Matching contributions which are equal to 50% of the employees deferral up to 8% of compensation included in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Income amounted to $9 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001. The plan was amended, effective April 1, 2001, to allow participants the ability to reallocate their investments in the NSTAR Common Share Fund to other investment options.
Effective January 1, 2002, consistent with the EGTRRA, the plan was further amended to allow for increased maximum annual pre-tax contributions and additional catch-up pre-tax contributions for participants age 50 or older, acceptance of other types of
roll-over pre-tax funds from other plans and the option of reinvesting dividends paid on the NSTAR Common Share Fund or receiving such dividends in cash. The election to reinvest dividends paid on the NSTAR Common Share fund or receive the
dividends in cash is subject to a freeze period beginning seven days prior to the date any dividend is paid. During this period, participants cannot change their election. Dividends are paid to this plan four times a year on February 1, May 1, August 1
and November 1. Note I.Pension and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension PBOP Adjustment Mechanism Tariff Filing On October 31, 2003, NSTAR received an order from the MDTE regarding NSTARs request filed on April 16, 2003 for the approval of a reconciliation rate adjustment mechanism PAM for recovery of costs associated with the
Companys obligation to provide its employees pension and PBOP benefits. Prior to the PAM order, the Company had accounted for these obligations in accordance with an Accounting Order received from the MDTE in December 2002. The PAM order authorizes NSTAR to recover its pension and PBOP expenses through a reconciling rate mechanism. This mechanism removes the volatility in earnings that may have resulted from requirements of existing accounting
standards and provides for an annual filing and rate adjustment with the MDTE. This order effectuates the Accounting Order, which allowed NSTAR to record a regulatory asset in lieu of taking a charge to OCI at December 31, 2002 for the additional minimum
liability in accordance with SFAS 87. In addition, the order revised the effective date included in the Accounting Order on which the Company could begin to defer the difference between the level of pension and PBOP expense included in rates and the amounts
that are required to be recorded under the pension and PBOP accounting rules to September 1, 2003. This date coincides to the expiration of NSTARs utility subsidiaries four-year distribution rate freeze. As a result, NSTAR recognized $135
million of expenses in the third quarter of 2003 that had been deferred earlier in the year. In accordance with the PAM order, the Company recognized $127 million of revenue related to carrying charges on the net prepaid balance. This carrying charge
will be collected from customers in 2004. On November 20, 2003, both NSTAR and the Massachusetts Attorney General filed motions with the MDTE for reconsideration of its PAM order. As of the date of this filing, no decision has been made by the MDTE on these matters for
reconsideration. NSTAR cannot predict the outcome of these motions, but NSTAR does not believe that the decision will have material impact on its earnings. Note J.Stock-Based Compensation The NSTAR 1997 Share Incentive Plan the Plan permits a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including stock options and deferred non-vested stock to be granted to key employees. The Plan limits the terms of awards to ten
years. Subject to adjustment for stock-splits and similar events, the aggregate number of common shares that may be awarded under the Plan is four million as a result of an amendment to the Plan approved by shareholders in 2002 that
Table of Contents increased the number of shares available for issuance from two million to four million, including shares issued in lieu of or upon reinvestment of dividends arising from awards. The weighted average grant date fair value of the
deferred stock issued during 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $4320, $4524 and $3970, respectively. During 2003, 109,900 deferred shares and 324,000 ten-year non-qualified stock options were granted under the Plan. During 2002, 95,300 deferred shares and
265,000 ten-year non-qualified stock options were granted. During 2001, 97,850 deferred shares and 240,500 ten-year non-qualified stock options were granted. The options were granted at the full market price of the common shares on the date of the
grant. All the awards vest ratably over a three-year period. Historically, the Company has acquired common shares in the open market to meet the level of options exercised.

the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest. As a result, this Debenture is included under current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2003.
Table of Contents Sewage facility revenue bonds are tax-exempt, subject to annual mandatory sinking fund redemption requirements and mature through 2015. Scheduled redemptions of $165 million were made in 2003 and 2002. The weighted average
interest rate of the bonds was 7375% in 2003 and 2002. The 575% tax-exempt unsecured MIFA bonds due 2014 are redeemable beginning in February 2004 at a redemption price of 102%. The redemption price decreases to 101% in February 2005 and to par in February 2006. On May 14, 2003, ComElectric entered into a $150 million, three-year variable rate unsecured Term Loan with a group of banks. The rate was set at 1875% for the initial six months and increased to 1895% for the second six-month
period. The net proceeds were used to repay outstanding short-term debt balances. The aggregate principal amounts of NSTAR long-term debt including securitization certificates and sinking fund requirements due in the five years subsequent to 2003 are approximately $230 million in 2004, $177 million in 2005, $248
million in 2006, $84 million in 2007 and $85 million in 2008. 2.Financial Covenant Requirements NSTAR and Boston Edison have no financial covenant requirements under their respective long-term debt arrangements. ComElectric, Cambridge Electric and NSTAR Gas have financial covenant requirements under their long-term debt
arrangements and were in compliance at December 31, 2003 and 2002. NSTARs long-term debt other than the Mortgage Bonds of NSTAR Gas is unsecured. The Transition Property Securitization Certificates held by Boston Edisons subsidiary, BEC Funding, LLC, are collaterized with a securitized regulatory asset with a balance of $4254 million and $4936 million as of December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. Boston Edison, as servicing agent for BEC Funding, collected $1023 million in 2003. These Certificates are non-recourse to Boston Edison. NSTAR has a credit facility of $175 million that consists of a three year, $175 million revolving credit agreement that expires on November 14, 2005. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, there were no amounts outstanding under this
revolving credit agreement. The $175 million credit facility serves as a backup to NSTARs $175 million commercial paper program that, at December 31, 2003 and 2002, had $15 million and $635 million outstanding, respectively. Under the terms of
this credit agreement, NSTAR is required to maintain a maximum total consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than 65% at all times, excluding Transition Property Securitization Certificates, and excluding Accumulated other comprehensive income
loss from Common equity, and to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest and taxes to consolidated total interest expense of not less than 2 to 1 for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. Commitment fees must be paid on the total
agreement amount. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, NSTAR was in full compliance with all of the aforementioned covenants. Boston Edison has approval from the FERC to issue short-term debt securities from time to time on or before December 31, 2004, with maturity dates no later than December 31, 2005, in amounts such that the aggregate principal does not
exceed $350 million at any one time. Boston Edison has a $350 million revolving credit agreement that expires on November 10, 2004. At December 31, 2003, there was no amount outstanding under this revolving credit agreement. These agreements serve
as backup to Boston Edisons $350 million commercial paper program that had a $1825 million balance at December 31, 2003 and no outstanding balance at
Table of Contents December 31, 2002. In October 2002, following receipt of the proceeds of its $500 million debt issue, its short-term debt balance was reduced to zero. Under the terms of this agreement, Boston Edison is required to maintain
a maximum total debt to capitalization ratio of not greater than 60% at all times, excluding Transition Property Securitization Certificates, and excluding Accumulated other comprehensive income loss from Common equity, and to maintain a ratio of consolidated
earnings before interest and taxes to consolidated total interest expense of not less than 2 to 1 for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. Commitment fees must be paid on the total agreement amount. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Boston Edison
was in full compliance with all of its covenants in connection with its short-term credit facilities. In addition, ComElectric, Cambridge Electric and NSTAR Gas, collectively, have $165 million available under several lines of credit and had $551 million and $1351 million outstanding under these lines of credit at December 31, 2003
and 2002, respectively. ComElectric and Cambridge Electric have FERC authorization to issue short-term securities from time-to-time on or before November 30, 2004 and June 27, 2004, respectively, with maturity dates no later than November 29, 2005 and June 26,
2005, respectively, in amounts such that the aggregate principal does not exceed $125 million and $60 million, respectively, at any one time. NSTAR Gas is not required to seek approval from FERC to issue short-term debt. Interest rates on the outstanding borrowings generally are money market rates and averaged 128% and 189% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In aggregate, short-term borrowings totaled $2391 million and $1986 million at December
31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Note M.Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of securities for which it is practicable to estimate the value 1.Cash and Cash Equivalents The carrying amounts of $165 million and $534 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively, approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these securities. 2.Indebtedness Excluding Notes Payable The fair values of long-term indebtedness are based upon the quoted market prices of similar issues. Carrying amounts and fair values as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 were as follows 2003 2002 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair in thousands Amount Value Amount Value Long-term indebtedness including current maturities 2,212,564 2,485,190 2,304,101 2,422,440 Note N.Segment and Related Information For the purpose of providing segment information, NSTARs principal operating segments, or its traditional core businesses, are the electric and natural gas utilities that provide energy delivery services in 107 cities and towns
in Massachusetts. The unregulated operating segment engages in business activities that include district energy operations, telecommunications and liquefied natural gas service. Amounts shown on the following table for 2003, 2002 and 2001 include
the allocation of NSTARs parent company
Table of Contents results of operations and assets, net of inter-company transactions, and primarily consist of interest charges and investment assets, respectively, to these business segments. The allocation of parent company charges is based on an
indirect allocation of the parent companys investment relating to these various business segments. The unregulated net income for 2003 reflects an increase in NSTARs wholesale telecommunications business and the sale of Blackstone Station that generated a $26 million gain. Offsetting these increases in unregulated
income were decreases at Advanced Energy Systems primarily due to fuel price increases. On December 24, 2003, NSTAR abandoned the 116 million shares of RCN common stock and recorded a pre-tax charge of $68 million including expenses. Offsetting the 2003
RCN abandonment loss is the recognition of $68 million of tax benefits resulting from unanticipated capital gain transactions. In addition, the unregulated net loss for 2002 and 2001 reflects reductions in the carrying value of NSTARs investment and its ultimate discontinuance of its Northwind chilled water operations in the amount of $1 million and $49
million, respectively. Effective September 30, 2002, certain chilled water operations were terminated in accordance with its contractual obligations. As part of the 2001 charge, NSTARs carrying value of this investment has been written-off
entirely. In addition, in 2002 and 2001, NSTAR had reserved for the removal costs of those assets. The net loss for 2002 and 2001 for the unregulated operations segment also includes the impact of non-cash, after-tax charges of $177 million and $1739
million, respectively, or $033 and $328 per share, related to the write-down of NSTARs investment in RCN. Excluding the impact of transactions related to NSTARs investment in RCN, NSTARs chilled water operations and the negative effect of the allocation of parent company losses, the unregulated operations segment would
otherwise reflect a minimal level of net income for the periods shown.

Table of Contents Note O.Contracts for the Purchase of Energy 1.NSTAR Electric Power Purchase Agreements NSTAR Electric expects to continue to make periodic market solicitations for default service and standard offer power supply consistent with provisions of the Massachusetts Electric Restructuring Act of 1997 Restructuring Act and MDTE
orders. NSTAR Electric has existing long-term power purchase agreements that are expected to supply approximately 80%-85% of its standard offer service obligations for 2004. NSTAR Electric has contracted with third party suppliers to provide 100% of its
standard offer supply obligation through December 31, 2004. In connection with this arrangement, NSTAR Electric has assigned its long-term power purchase agreements to one supplier through December 31, 2004. NSTAR Electric is recovering its payments to
suppliers through MDTE approved rates billed to customers. NSTAR Electrics existing portfolio of long-term power purchase contracts supplied a significant amount of its standard offer including wholesale energy requirements in 2003. Also during
2003 and 2002, NSTAR Electric entered into an agreement whereby all of its energy supply entitlements were transferred to an independent energy supplier, following which NSTAR Electric repurchased its energy resource needs from this independent energy supplier for
NSTAR Electrics ultimate sale to its standard offer customers. Capacity costs of long-term contracts reflect NSTAR Electrics proportionate share of capital and fixed operating costs of certain generating units. In 2003, these cost were attributed to 5297 MW of capacity
purchased. Energy costs are paid to generators based on a price per kWh actually received into NSTAR Electrics distribution system and are included in the total cost. Total capacity purchased in 2003 was 1,2014 MW.

obligation, other than to large customers, for the second-half of 2004. NSTAR Electric has entered into a short-term power purchase agreement to meet its entire default service supply obligation for large customers through March 2004. A Request for
Proposals will be issued quarterly in 2004 for the remainder of the obligation for large customers and semi-annually for non-large customers in accordance with MDTE regulations. NSTAR Electric entered into agreements ranging in length from six to twelve-months
effective January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2003 with suppliers to provide full default service energy and ancillary service requirements at contract rates approved by the MDTE. 2.NSTAR Gas Firm Transportation and Storage Agreements NSTAR Gas purchases transportation, storage and balancing services from Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company and Algonquin Gas Transmission Company, as well as other upstream pipelines that bring gas from major producing regions in the U.S.,
Gulf of Mexico and Canada to the final delivery points in the NSTAR Gas service area. NSTAR Gas also utilizes contracts for underground storage facilities to meet its winter peaking demands. The underground storage contracts are a combination of existing
and new agreements that are the result of FERC Order 636 service unbundling. During the summer injection season, excess pipeline capacity is used to deliver and store gas in market area storage facilities, located in the New York and Pennsylvania region.
Stored gas is withdrawn during the winter season to supplement pipeline supplies in order to meet firm heating demand. NSTAR Gas has firm storage capacity entitlements of nearly 80 billion cubic feet. NSTAR Gas has various contractual agreements covering the transportation of natural gas and underground natural gas storage facilities, which are recoverable from customers under the MDTE-approved Cost of Gas Adjustment Clause.
These contracts expire at various times from 2004 to 2014. NSTAR Gas firm contract demand charges associated with firm pipeline transportation and storage capacity contracts in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were approximately $505 million, $518 million and $518
million, respectively. NSTAR Gas firm contract demand charges at current rates under these contracts for the years after 2003 are as follows Table of Contents Capacity Charge in thousands Obligation 2004 49,909 2005 49,709 2006 46,588 2007 36,832 2008 35,522 Years thereafter 125,803 344,363 Note P.Other Utility Matters Service Quality Indicators Service quality indicators are established performance benchmarks for certain identified measures of service quality relating to customer service and billing performance, customer satisfaction, and reliability and safety performance for
all Massachusetts utilities. NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas are required to report annually to the MDTE concerning their performance as to each measure and are subject to maximum penalties of up to two percent of transmission and distribution revenues should
performance fail to meet the applicable benchmarks. On February 28, 2003, NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas filed their 2002 Service Quality Reports with the MDTE that reflected significant improvements in reliability and performance; the reports indicate that no penalty was assessed for
2002. The MDTE concurred with NSTARs determination in an order issued on September 30, 2003. NSTAR monitors its service quality continuously to determine its contingent liability, and if it were determined that a liability has been incurred and is
estimable, an appropriate liability would be accrued. Annually, each NSTAR utility subsidiary makes a service quality performance filing with the MDTE. Any settlement or rate order that would result in a different liability level from what has been
accrued would be adjusted in the period an agreement is reached with the MDTE. As of December 31, 2003, NSTAR Electrics and NSTAR Gas 2003 performance has exceeded the applicable established benchmarks such that no liability has been accrued for 2003. Generating Assets Divestiture a.Seabrook Nuclear Power Station On November 1, 2002, FPL Group, Inc. purchased 88% of the majority ownership interest in the Seabrook Nuclear Power Station, including Canals 352% ownership interest, for $7994 million, net of closing adjustments. FPL Group
assumed responsibility for the ultimate decommissioning of the facility and received the Seabrook decommissioning funds of approximately $2269 million at the closing. Canals portion of the sale proceeds amounted to $319 million, of which $35 million
was paid into the decommissioning trust as a final top-off and $13 million was used for other transaction costs. The net proceeds of $271 million were less than Canals remaining investment in Seabrook. The difference of approximately $162
million was included as a component of Cambridge Electrics and ComElectrics transition cost recovery and has been collected from ComElectrics and Cambridge Electrics customers in 2003 through the transition charge. As part of this
sale, all purchased power agreements were terminated. The Seabrook sale did not have an impact on NSTARs current results of operations. The future impact of the sale will not have a material effect on NSTARs results of operations, cash flow
or financial position.
Table of Contents b.Blackstone Station On April 8, 2003, Cambridge Electric completed the sale of Blackstone Station to Harvard University Harvard for $146 million. The net proceeds $104 million from the sale were used to reduce Cambridge Electrics
transition charge. The sale by Cambridge Electric was approved by the MDTE on March 14, 2003. Also on April 8, 2003, NSTAR Steam Corporation completed the sale of its Blackstone Station steam assets to Harvard for $3 million. The net impact of these
transactions resulted in a pretax gain of $13 million. Under terms of an operating agreement, NSTAR Steam will continue to manage the day-to-day operations of the steam plant on this site for one year after the sale. Note Q.Commitments and Contingencies 1.Contractual Commitments NSTAR also has leases for facilities and equipment. The estimated minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable capital and operating leases for the years after 2003 are as follows in thousands 2004 20,979 2005 17,152 2006 13,238 2007 10,454 2008 8,617 Years thereafter 38,885 109,325 The total expense for both lease rentals and transmission agreements was $882 million in 2003, 866 million in 2002 and $827 million in 2001, net of capitalized expenses of $19 million in 2003, $23 million in 2002 and $29 million
in 2001. Total rent expense for all operating leases, except those with terms of a month or less, amounted to $76 million in 2003, $91 million in 2002 and $104 million in 2001. NSTAR Electric has entered into a short-term power purchase agreement to meet its entire default service supply obligation, other than to large customers, for the period January 1, 2004 through June 30, 2004 and for 50% of its
obligation, other than to large customers, for the second-half of 2004. NSTAR Electric has entered into a short-term power purchase agreement to meet its entire default service supply obligation for large customers through March 2004. A Request for
Proposals will be issued quarterly in 2004 for the remainder of the obligation for large customers and semi-annually for non-large customers in accordance with MDTE regulations. NSTAR Electric entered into agreements ranging in length from six to twelve-months
effective January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2003 with suppliers to provide full default service energy and ancillary service requirements at contract rates approved by the MDTE. NSTAR Electric is currently recovering payments it is making to suppliers from
its customers and has financial and performance assurances and financial guarantees in place with those suppliers to protect NSTAR Electric from risk in the unlikely event any of its suppliers encounter financial difficulties or fail to maintain an investment grade
credit rating. In connection with certain of these agreements, should, in the unlikely event, an individual NSTAR Electric distribution company receive a credit rating below investment grade, that company potentially could be required to obtain certain financial
commitments, including but not limited to, letters of credit. Refer to Note O, Contracts for the Purchase of Energy for a further discussion.
Table of Contents 2.Electric Equity Investments and Joint Ownership Interest NSTAR has an equity investment of approximately 145% in two companies that own and operate transmission facilities to import electricity from the Hydro-Quebec system in Canada. As an equity participant, NSTAR is required to
guarantee, in addition to each companies own share, the obligations of those participants who do not meet certain credit criteria. At December 31, 2003, NSTARs portion of these guarantees amounted to $111 million. New England
Hydro-Transmission Electric Company, Inc. NEH and New England Hydro-Transmission Corporation NHH have agreed to use their best efforts to limit their equity investment to 40% of their total capital during the time NEH and NHH have outstanding debt in their
capital structure. In order to meet their best efforts obligations pursuant to the Equity Funding Agreement dated June 1, 1985, as amended, for NEH and NHH, in 2003, NEH repurchased a total of 270,000 of its outstanding shares from all equity holders and NHH
repurchased a total of 1,075 outstanding shares from all equity holders. Through December 31, 2003, NSTAR Electrics reduction of its equity ownership resulting from NEH buy-back of 39,061 shares and NHH buy-back of 156 shares was approximately
$851,000. Canal had owned a 352% joint ownership interest in the Seabrook Nuclear Power Station Seabrook until November 1, 2002. On that date, FPL Group, Inc. purchased an 88% ownership interest in Seabrook, including Canals 352%
ownership interest for $7994 million, net of closing adjustments. Canals portion of the proceeds amounted to $319 million, less the $35 million paid into the decommissioning trust as a final top-off and $13 million for other transaction costs.
The net proceeds of $271 million were less than Canals remaining investment in Seabrook. The net result of this transaction was included as a component of Cambridge Electrics and ComElectrics transition cost recovery of approximately $162
million and was collected from Cambridge Electrics and ComElectrics customers in 2003 through the transition charge. As part of this sale, all purchased power agreements were terminated. This transaction did not have an impact on
NSTARs current results of operations. The future impact of this transaction will not have a material effect on NSTARs operations. Cambridge Electric had a 265% interest in the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant. On July 31, 2002, Vermont Yankee was sold for approximately $180 million to Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee, LLC Entergy. The sale agreement
provided, among other items, that Entergy assume responsibility for the ultimate decommissioning of the facility and received the Vermont Yankee decommissioning funds. Pursuant to the terms of an Additional Power Contract, Cambridge Electric is obligated to
purchase its 25% entitlement percentage of the output of the plant through the current license term ending in March 2012. The plants owners, before the sale, were a consortium of New England utilities, including Cambridge Electric. This
transaction did not have an impact on NSTARs results of operations or cash flows. The net result of this transaction was included as a component of Cambridge Electrics transition cost recovery and is reflected on the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets as a Regulatory asset. NSTAR Electric collectively has an equity ownership of 14% in Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company CYAPC, 14% in Yankee Atomic Electric Company YAEC, and 4% in Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company, the Yankee
Companies. Periodically, NSTAR obtains estimates from the management of the Yankee Companies on the cost of decommissioning the Connecticut Yankee nuclear unit CY, the Yankee Atomic nuclear unit YA, and the Maine Yankee nuclear unit MY.
These nuclear units are completely shut down and are currently conducting decommissioning activities. Based on estimates from the Yankee Companies management as of December 31, 2003, the total remaining cost for decommissioning each nuclear unit is approximately as follows: $666 million for CY, $181 million for YA and $364
million for MY. Of these amounts, NSTAR Electric is obligated to pay $933 million towards the decommissioning of CY, $254 million toward YA, and
Table of Contents 146 million toward MY. These estimates are recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as Power contract liabilities with a corresponding regulatory asset and do not impact the current results of operations.
These estimates may be revised from time to time based on information available to the Yankee Companies regarding future costs. NSTAR expects the Yankee Companies to seek recovery of these costs and any additional increases to these costs in rate applications with the FERC, with any resulting adjustments being charged to their respective sponsors, including
NSTAR Electric. NSTAR Electric would recover its share of any allowed increases from customers through the transition charge. The various decommissioning trusts for which NSTAR or it subsidiaries are responsible through their equity ownership are established pursuant to the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 18 - Conservation of Power and Water
Resources. The investment of decommissioning funds that have been established, are managed in accordance with these federal guidelines, state jurisdictions and with the applicable Internal Revenue Service requirements. Some of the requirements state that
these investments be managed independently by a prudent fund manager and that funds are to be invested in conservative, minimum risk investment securities. Any gains or losses are anticipated to be refunded to or collected from customers,
respectively. 3.Financial and Performance Guarantees On a limited basis, NSTAR and certain of its subsidiaries may enter into agreements providing financial assurance to third parties. Such agreements include letters of credit, surety bonds, and other guarantees. At December 31, 2003, outstanding guarantees totaled $321 million as follows in thousands Letters of Credit 5,527 Surety Bonds 15,476 Other Guarantees 11,100 Total Guarantees 32,103 The $55 million letter of credit is for the benefit of a third party, as trustee in connection with the 6924% Notes of one of NSTARs subsidiaries. The letter of credit is available if the subsidiary has insufficient funds
to pay the debt service requirements. As of December 31, 2003, there have been no amounts drawn under this letter of credit. As of December 31, 2003, certain of NSTARs subsidiaries have purchased a total of $07 million of performance surety bonds for the purpose of obtaining licenses, permits and rights-of-way in various municipalities. In
addition, NSTAR has purchased approximately $147 million in workers compensation self-insurer bonds. These bonds support the guarantee by NSTAR to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts required as part of NSTARs workers compensation
self-insurance program. NSTAR and its subsidiaries have also issued $111 million of residual value guarantees related to its equity interest in the Hydro-Quebec transmission companies. Management believes the likelihood NSTAR would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote. Table of Contents 4.Environmental Matters As of December 31, 2003, NSTARs subsidiaries are involved in 5 state regulated properties Massachusetts Contingency Plan, or MCP sites where oil or other hazardous materials were previously spilled
or released. The NSTAR subsidiaries are required to clean up or otherwise remediate these properties in accordance with specific state regulations. There are sometimes uncertainties associated with total remediation costs due to the final selection of the
specific cleanup technology and the particular characteristics of the different sites. Estimates of approximately $07 million and $08 million are included as liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. In addition to the MCP sites, NSTAR subsidiaries also face possible liability as a result of involvement in 12 multi-party disposal sites or third party claims associated with contamination remediation. NSTAR generally expects to
have only a small percentage of the total potential liability for these sites. Estimates of approximately $34 million are included as liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2003 and 2002. The MCP and multi-party disposal site amounts have not been reduced by any potential rate recovery treatment of these costs or any potential recovery from NSTARs insurance carriers. Prospectively, should NSTAR be allowed to
collect these specific costs from customers, it would record an offsetting regulatory asset and record a credit to operating expenses equal to previously expensed costs. NSTAR Gas is participating in the assessment or remediation of five former manufactured gas plant MGP sites and alleged MGP waste disposal locations to determine if and to what extent such sites have been contaminated and whether
NSTAR Gas may be responsible for remedial action. The MDTE has approved recovery of costs associated with MGP sites over a 7-year period, without carrying costs. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, NSTAR has recorded a liability of approximately $44
million and $48 million, respectively, as an estimate for site cleanup costs for several MGP sites for which NSTAR Gas was previously cited as a potentially responsible party. A corresponding regulatory asset has been recorded that reflects the future rate
recovery for these costs. Estimates related to environmental remediation costs are reviewed and adjusted periodically as further investigation and assignment of responsibility occurs and as either additional sites are identified or NSTARs responsibilities
for such sites evolve or are resolved. NSTARs ultimate liability for future environmental remediation costs may vary from these estimates. Based on NSTARs current assessment of its environmental responsibilities, existing legal requirements and
regulatory policies, NSTAR does not believe that these environmental remediation costs will have a material adverse effect on NSTARs consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows for a reporting period. 5.Income Tax Matters On December 24, 2003, NSTAR exited from its investment in RCN and formally abandoned the 116 million shares of RCN common stock. The Company will claim an ordinary loss on its 2003 tax return as opposed to a capital loss that
would have resulted from a sale of the stock. The Companys position relative to the tax consequences of the transaction is supported by an opinion from an independent tax advisor. The ordinary loss tax treatment results in the Company realizing the benefits represented by the tax asset recorded on its books that resulted from the previous write-down of this asset for financial reporting purposes. The
requirement for a tax valuation allowance, therefore, no longer exists. The Company has reversed this reserve as of December 31, 2003.
Table of Contents The Company believes it more likely than not that it is entitled to an ordinary loss deduction. The Company expects the IRS to review this transaction and it is reasonably possible that the IRS will disagree. In accordance
with the Companys tax policy as it relates to uncertain tax positions, the Company has established a loss contingency reserve of approximately $44 million at December 31, 2003. This amount represents the tax impact to the Company should the ordinary loss
ultimately be recharacterized to a capital loss. This reserve is recorded as part of Deferred credits - other on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company believes that its position is well supported. However, if the Companys position proves incorrect, the Company may be required to make future cash expenditures that may impact NSTARs consolidated results
of operations and cash flows in a future period. 6.Regulatory and Legal Proceedings a.Regulatory proceedings In December 2003, NSTAR Electric filed proposed transition rate adjustments for 2004, including a preliminary reconciliation of transition, transmission, standard offer and default service costs and revenues through 2003. The MDTE
subsequently approved tariffs for each retail electric subsidiary effective January 1, 2004. The filings were updated in February 2004 to reflect final 2003 costs and revenues which are subject to final reconciliation. On November 6, 2003, Boston Edison received approval of a Settlement Agreement with the Massachusetts Attorney General AG from the MDTE resolving issues in Boston Edisons reconciliation of costs and revenues for the year
2002. This settlement had a minimal impact to Boston Edisons results of operation. Effective September 1, 2003, Boston Edisons, ComElectrics and Cambridge Electrics Standard Offer Service Fuel Adjustment SOSFA rates were modified upon approval by the MDTE. The MDTE has allowed companies to
adjust prices to reduce deferred cost balances that arise due to rapidly changing market costs for the oil and natural gas used to generate electricity and the SOSFA is designed to collect the costs of fuel that companies incur for purchasing electricity from their
suppliers to serve their standard offer service customers. The Boston Edison SOSFA was reduced to zero while the ComElectric and Cambridge Electric SOSFAs were increased to 1424 cents per kilowatt-hour. These changes followed an increase in this rate
adjustment from zero to 0902 cents per kilowatt-hour that was effective May 1, 2003 for all three NSTAR electric companies. The SOSFA was at zero from April 1, 2002 through April 30, 2003 for all three NSTAR electric companies. The MDTE has ruled that
these fuel index adjustments are excluded from the 15% rate reduction requirement under the Restructuring Act. Effective January 1, 2004, NSTAR Electrics SOSFA rates were modified again with the approval of the MDTE. The Boston Edison SOSFA remained at zero per kilowatt-hour. The ComElectric and Cambridge Electric SOSFA were
reduced to 1223 cents per kilowatt-hour. In December 2002, NSTAR Electric filed proposed transition rate adjustments for 2003, including a preliminary reconciliation of transition, transmission, standard offer and default service costs and revenues through 2002. The MDTE
subsequently approved tariffs for each retail electric subsidiary effective January 1, 2003. The filings were updated in February 2003 to include final costs and revenues for 2002. On November 14, 2002, Boston Edison received approval of a Settlement Agreement with the AG from the MDTE resolving issues in Boston Edisons reconciliation of costs and revenues for the year 2001. Among other issues, the
Settlement Agreement included an adjustment for the reconciliation of costs related to securitization and efforts to mitigate costs incurred in relation to a
Table of Contents purchased power agreement with Hydro Quebec. As a result of this Settlement Agreement with the AG, Boston Edison recognized approximately $114 million in additional transition charge revenues in 2002. This benefit was
significantly offset by several other regulatory true-up adjustments. c. Other Legal Matters In the normal course of its business, NSTAR and its subsidiaries are involved in certain legal matters, including civil litigations. Management is unable to fully determine a range of reasonably possible court-ordered damages,
settlement amounts, and related litigation costs legal liabilities that would be in excess of amounts accrued and amounts covered by insurance. Based on the information currently available, NSTAR does not believe that it is probable that any
such legal liability will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position. However, it is reasonably possible that additional legal liabilities that may result from changes in estimates could have a material impact on its results of operations for
a reporting period. Table of Contents Report of Independent Auditors To the Shareholders and Trustees of NSTAR In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under a1 on page 93, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of NSTAR and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and
2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under a2 on page 93, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of NSTARs management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP s/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP Boston, Massachusetts
