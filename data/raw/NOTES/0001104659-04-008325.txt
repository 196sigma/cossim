Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Independent Auditors Report
The Board of Directors and
Shareholders
Datalink Corporation We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of
Datalink Corporation as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and the related
statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for the years
then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. The financial statements of Datalink
Corporation for the year ended December31, 2001, were audited by other
auditors who have ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an unqualified
opinion on those financial statements in their report dated February8,
2002.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the 2003 and 2002 financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Datalink Corporation. as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.
As discussed above, the
2001 financial statements of Datalink Corporation were audited by other
auditors who have ceased operations. As described in note 3, these financial
statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
which was adopted by the Company as of January1, 2002. In our opinion,
the disclosures for 2001 in note 3 are appropriate. However, we were not
engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 financial
statements of Datalink Corporation, other than with respect to such disclosures
and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance
on the 2001 financial statements taken as a whole. s/ KPMG LLP

February6, 2004 26 This is a copy of an accountants report previously
issued by Arthur Andersen LLP Andersen. This report has not been reissued
by Andersen. After a reasonable effort, we have been unable to obtain the
consent of Andersen for the incorporation by reference of the report dated February8,
2002 included in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December31,
2002. The financial statements for the year ended December31, 2001 have
been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, which was adopted by the Company as of January1, 2002. Under
these circumstances Rule437a under the Securities Act of 1933 permits us
to file a Registration Statement without a written consent from Andersen. We
are not able to obtain the written consent of Andersen to incorporate by
reference this report into our previously filed registration statements on FormS-8,
File number 333-93229 and FormS-3, File number 333-96901. In addition, we
will not be able to obtain the written consent of Andersen for any future
registration statement we may file as required by Section7 of the
Securities Act. Accordingly, investors will not be able to sue Andersen
pursuant to Section11 of the Securities Act relating to those
registration statements and therefore may have their recovery limited as a
result of the lack of consent. The ability of investors to recover from Andersen
may also be limited as a result of their financial condition or other matters
relating to the various civil and criminal lawsuits relating to them.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Description of
Business Datalink Corporation the Company
is an independent architect of enterprise-class information storage
infrastructures. The Company derives its revenues principally from designing,
installing and supporting data storage systems. The Companys solutions can
include hardware products, such as disk arrays, tape systems and
interconnection components, and storage management software products. The
Company is frequently engaged to provide assistance in the installation of
solutions and to provide support services subsequent to the installation.
Occasionally, the Company is engaged for consulting services.
2. Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist
principally of money market funds with original maturities of three months or
less, are readily convertible to cash and are stated at cost, which
approximates fair value.
Accounts Receivable, net Accounts receivable are
recorded net of the reserve for doubtful accounts of $98,000 and $197,000 at December31,
2003 and 2002, respectively.
Concentration of Credit Risk During 2003, 2002 and
2001, net sales to one customer totaled 10%, 5% and 9% of total net sales,
respectively. The balance of accounts receivable for this customer as a
percentage of total accounts receivable as of December31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively is 3% and 23%, respectively.
Software Development Costs In compliance with the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants AICPA Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for Computer
Software Developed for or Obtained for Internal Use, the Company capitalizes
certain costs associated with software developed or obtained for internal use
when both the preliminary project stage is completed and management has
authorized further funding for the project which it deems probable of
completion and use for the function intended. Capitalized internal-use software
costs include only 1 external direct costs of materials and services consumed
in developing or obtaining the software, 2 payroll and payroll-related costs
for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the
project, and 3 interest cost incurred, when material, while developing the
software. Capitalization of such costs ceases no later than the point at which
the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose.
Research and development costs and other computer software maintenance costs
related to software development are expensed as incurred. The determination of
when the software is placed into production and ongoing assessment of the
recoverability of these costs requires considerable judgment by management with
respect to certain external factors, including anticipated future revenues,
estimated economic life, and changes in hardware and software technology. 
During 2000, the Company
began the implementation of a new customer relationship management CRM
application suite. The Company capitalized costs of the implementation of
$234,000 in 2003, $13 million in 2002 and $10 million in 2001. The system is
complete and no further costs are expected. Amounts are being amortized over a
period of 3 years from the date they are available for use. Amortization of
software costs were $815,000 in 2003, $536,000 in 2002, and $139,000 in 2001. 32 Inventories Inventories, including
inventories shipped but not installed, principally consist of data storage
products and components, that are valued at the lower of cost or market with
cost determined on a first-in, first-out FIFO method.
Property and Equipment Property
and equipment, including purchased software, are stated at cost. Depreciation
and amortization are provided by charges to operations using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 2 to 10
years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
shorter of their estimated useful lives or the underlying lease term. The costs
and related accumulated depreciation and amortization on asset disposals are
removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations. Major
renewals and betterments are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are
charged to current operations when incurred.

Goodwill The Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142, Goodwill and
Other Intangibles Assets, under which goodwill is no longer amortized on January1,
2002. See Note 3. As of January1, 2002 the Company had net unamortized
goodwill of $55 million. The Company evaluated its existing intangible assets
and goodwill that were acquired in prior business combinations and determined
there was no impairment upon adoption. Goodwill is no longer being amortized
against earnings and goodwill balances are subject to an impairment review on
an annual basis or sooner if indicators of potential impairment exist. In
addition, the new rulesfurther defined the classes of intangible assets
which caused the Company to reclassify the $652,000 unamortized balance of an
intangible asset represented by the estimated value of assembled workforce to
goodwill as of January1, 2002. The Company completed its annual
impairment testing of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2003 and concluded
that no impairment existed. The value of assembled workforce at December31,
2001 was also reclassified in these financial statements for comparative
purposes.
Intangibles, net Identifiable intangible
assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives of 3 to 7 years. In October2003, the Company announced several cost
reduction actions. These actions included closing an office and terminating personnel
acquired by the Company from OpenSystems.com in November2000, resulting
in an impairment of the Companys customer base intangible asset. The Company
estimated the impact that closure of this office and termination of its
personnel would have on the OpenSystems.com customer accounts and the related
expected cash flows, considering the likelihood  33 of
retaining the customers without an office presence. The Company then compared
the undiscounted cash flows with the net book value of the intangible asset
which indicated the asset was impaired. To determine the impairment charge of
$926,000, the Company calculated the discounted cash flows and compared them to
the net book value of the intangible and determined the resulting impairment
charge of the asset.
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically
at least annually analyzes its long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible
assets with discrete lives, for potential impairment, assessing the
appropriateness of lives and recoverability of unamortized balances through
measurement of undiscounted operating cash flows on a basis consistent with
generally accepted accounting principles.
Stock Options As permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No123, the Company has elected to continue following
the guidance of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25 for
measurement and recognition of stock-based transactions with employees. No
compensation cost has been recognized for stock options granted to employees
under the plans where the exercise price of the options granted was equal to
the fair value of the common stock at the date of grant.
Pro
forma net loss and loss per share have been determined as if the Company had
used the fair value method of accounting for its stock option grants and
employee stock purchase plan share elections consistent with the method of SFAS
No123. Under this method, compensation expense is recognized over the
applicable vesting periods and is based on the shares under option and their
related fair values on the grant date.

During the 2003, the
Companys employees elected to purchase 23,883 shares under the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan ESPP. Using the Black-Scholes pricing model, the weighted
average fair value was $040 per share for each election. During the 2002 and
2001 ESPP offering, employees elected to purchase 59,504 and 61,879,
respectively. Using the Black-Scholes pricing model, the weighted average fair
value was $054 per share for each election in 2002 and $019 per share for
each election in 2001.
Income Taxes The Company calculates income taxes in accordance with
the provisions of SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which
requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for income
taxes. Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are recorded to
reflect the tax consequences in future years of temporary differences between
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts
using enacted tax rates for the years in which these items are expected to
affect taxable income. The Company establishes valuation allowances when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Company expects are
more likely than not to realize. Income tax benefit expense is the tax
payable receivable for the period and the change during the period in
deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Use of Estimates The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition The Company realizes revenue from the design,
installation and support of data storage solutions, which may include hardware,
software and services. The Company recognizes revenue when it has received an
order from the customer, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery
has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, obligations for
installation or other services are complete and collectability is reasonably
assured. The following summarizes the major terms of our contractual
relationships with our customers and the manner in which we account for sales
transactions.
Product
sales. The Company applies the provisions of
Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software
Revenue Recognition, and related interpretations to the hardware,
software and services elements of its data storage solutions. For software or
hardware product sales whereby the Company does not provide any installation or
configuration services, revenue is recognized upon shipment. For data storage
solutions with hardware, software and services sold as a bundled arrangement,
the Company considers the services to be essential to the functionality and
revenues are recognized on a completed contract basis pursuant to American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants SOP 81-1, Accounting for
Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts. As the Company has vendor specific  35 objective evidence of the
values of its hardware, software and services, it uses the relative fair values
of these elements to allocate revenues between product sales and service sales
on its data storage projects.
Service
sales. For consulting services contracts
that do not include the sale of hardware or software product, the Company
recognizes revenue as the services are performed
The Company also sells service contracts to most of
its customers. These contracts are support service agreements. The Company has
an internal support desk to provide integrated customer support services. The
Company fulfills on-site assistance by purchasing support service agreements
for customers from the hardware and software vendors or their designated third-party
service providers and by arranging on-site support assistance with the
appropriate vendor when necessary. When the service contracts are sold as part
of a data storage solution in a bundled arrangement, the Company uses vendor
specific objective evidence to allocate revenue to the service contract
element. The revenues and direct costs resulting from these service contracts
are deferred and amortized into operations over the term of the contracts,
which are generally twelve months. The Company is contractually obligated to
provide or arrange to provide these underlying support services to its
customers in the unlikely event that the hardware or software vendor, or its
designee, fails to perform according to the terms of its contract.
Deferred revenue is
comprised of deferrals for maintenance and other services for which payment has
been received and for which the service has not yet been performed.
Net Income Loss Per Share Basic net income loss per share is computed using
the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share
includes the effect of common stock equivalents, if any, for each period. The
number of additional shares is calculated by assuming that outstanding stock
options were exercised and that the proceeds from such exercise were used to
acquire shares of common stock at the average market price during the reporting
period. Due to the net loss in 2003, 2002 and 2001, potential common shares of
105,931, 62,536 and 62,564, respectively, would have been anti-dilutive to
losses and as a result were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per
share.
Comprehensive Income Loss The Companys comprehensive income loss is equal to
its net income for all periods presented.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December2002, the FASB issued SFAS No148,
Stock Compensation. SFAS No148 provides alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No148 amends
the disclosure requirements of SFAS No123 to require prominent
disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results. The Company does not plan to change its method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation.
In December2002, the EITF issued EITF 00-21,
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. This Issue addresses certain
aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will
perform multiple revenue-generating activities. In some arrangements, the
different revenue-generating activities deliverables are sufficiently
separable, and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to
separately account for some or all of the deliverables that is, there are
separate units of accounting. In other arrangements, some or all of the
deliverables are not independently functional, or there is not sufficient
evidence of their fair values to account for them separately. This Issue
addresses when and, if so, how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables
should be divided into separate units of accounting.  36 This Issue does not change
otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria. This Issue was applicable
for the Company beginning in July2003 and did not have an impact on
revenue recognition.
In December2003, the
SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No104, Revenue Recognition,
which supersedes SAB No101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.
SAB No104 rescinds accounting guidance in SAB No101 related to
multiple-element arrangements as this guidance has been superseded as a result
of the issuance of EITF 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables. The adoption of
SAB No104 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial
position or results of operations.
Reclassifications Certain 2001 amounts have
been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December31,
2003, 2002 and 2001 was $28 million, $16 million and $0, respectively. The
net change in the total valuation allowance for the years ended December31,
2003, 2002 and 2001 was an increase of $12 million, $16 million and $0,
respectively.
In assessing the recoverability of deferred tax
assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become
deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax
liabilities, carry back potential and projected future taxable income and tax
planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of taxable
losses in recent years and uncertainty of future taxable income, management
believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the
benefits of these deductible differences at December31, 2003.
At December31, 2003,
the Company had federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $40
million and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $110
million, which are available to offset future federal and state taxable income.
If not used, these net operating loss carry forwards will expire between 2013
and 2023. 39 7. Lease

principal technical operations and the integration, assembly and support
services operations are located in a 104,000 square foot office and warehouse
facility in Chanhassen, Minnesota. The Companys remaining 14 locations

8. Restructuring Charges In October2003, the Company announced several cost
reduction initiatives and management changes. These changes resulted in a
fourth quarter 2003 charge of $21 million. As part of these cost reduction
initiatives, the Company reduced its staff by 16%. Employee severance charges
were $568,000. The Company also announced the closure of four offices. Office
closing costs for lease terminations were $584,000. The office closures
included an office with a significant amount of customers obtained in the
Companys OpenSystems.com acquisition in November2000, resulting in an
impairment of this customer base intangible asset. The resulting impairment
charge of the asset was $926,000. During 2004, the Company expects to pay all
remaining severance amounts accrued at December31, 2003. The Company
expects to settle the remaining accrual for lease terminations and office
closures by the end of the first quarter of 2004.

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to
employees using the intrinsic value method as prescribed in Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employee,
and related interpretations. Accordingly, compensation cost for stock options
granted to employees is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of
the Companys common stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee
must pay to acquire the stock.
During 2000 and 1999, the
Company issued 135,850 options with an exercise price below the fair market
value of common stock at the date of grant. The intrinsic value of the options
is being recorded to compensation expense over the vesting period, generally
four years. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, $111,000, $118,000 and $119,000,
respectively, of compensation expense was recorded related to these options. As
of December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, there was $17,000, $128,000 and
$246,000, respectively, of compensation expense related to these options that
will be recognized in future periods. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company
issued 46,750, 47,250 and 49,750 options, respectively, to directors below the
fair market value of common stock at the date of grant. The compensation
expense recorded was $83,000, $90,000 and $27,000 in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Because the options vest immediately, all compensation expense
was recorded in the period of the grant.
