MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     The consolidated financial statements of Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc. and Subsidiaries and the other information contained in this Annual Report on
Form10-K were prepared by and are the responsibility of management. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and necessarily include amounts based on management best estimates and judgments. 
In
fulfilling its responsibilities, management relies on a system of internal controls, which provide reasonable assurance that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial
statements and maintaining accountability of assets. Internal controls are designed to reduce the risk that material errors or irregularities in the financial statements may occur and not be timely
detected. These systems are augmented by written policies, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, an organizational structure providing for the division of responsibilities and a
program of financial, operational and systems reviews. 
The
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed of four non-employee directors, is responsible for recommending to the Board of Directors the independent accounting
firm to be retained each year. The Audit Committee meets regularly, and when appropriate separately, with the independent auditors and management to review the Company performance. The independent
auditors and the Audit Committee have unrestricted access to each other in the discharge of their responsibilities. s/JOHN P. WILMERS John P. Wilmers

whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc. and Subsidiaries      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    
1.Company 
Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc., a Delaware corporation Ballantyne or the Company, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Strong Westrex,Inc., Strong
Technical Services,Inc., and Strong Digital Systems,Inc., design, develop, manufacture, service and distribute theatre equipment and lighting systems. The Company products are
distributed to movie exhibition companies, sports arenas, auditoriums, amusement parks and special venues. Sales in 2007 were distributed as follows: Theatre91%, Lighting8 and Other1%. Refer to the Business Segment Section note21 for further information. 
2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
The principal accounting policies upon which the accompanying consolidated financial statements are based are summarized as follows: 
a.Basis
of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation. 
b.Use
of Estimates 
The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results and changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect results of operations and financial position in future periods. 
c.Trade
Accounts Receivable 
Trade
accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Amounts collected on trade accounts receivable are included in net cash provided by operating
activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
The
Company maintained an allowance for doubtful accounts of $534,526 and $498,783 at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. This allowance is developed based on several
factors including overall customer credit quality, historical write-off experience and a specific analysis that projects the ultimate collectability of the account. As such, these factors
may change over time causing the reserve level to adjust accordingly. 
d.Inventories Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or market and include appropriate elements of material, labor and manufacturing overhead.
Inventory balances are net of reserves of slow moving or obsolete inventory estimated based on management review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales. 
e.Goodwill
and Intangible Assets 
Goodwill
represents the excess of cost over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired through purchase business combinations in accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill and intangible assets that are determined to have
an indefinite useful life are not amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually as well as when events and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have 
39 
Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued occurred.
Certain factors that may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include, but are not limited to, operating results that are lower than expected and adverse industry or market economic
trends. 
The
impairment testing requires management to estimate the fair value of the assets or reporting unit. The estimate of the fair value of the assets is determined on the basis of
discounted cash flows. In estimating the fair value, management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows, future revenues, future earnings in addition to other
factors. The fair value of the reporting unit is then compared to the carrying amount of the assets to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date for the excess of the carrying amount of
the reporting unit assets over the fair value of the reporting unit assets. 
Intangible
assets with definite lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS
No144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. 
f.Property,
Plant and Equipment 
Significant
expenditures for the replacement or expansion of property, plant and equipment are capitalized. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided over the estimated
useful lives of the respective assets using the straight-line method. For financial reporting purposes, assets are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of 20years for
buildings and improvements, 3 to 10years for machinery and equipment, 7years for furniture and fixtures and 3years for computers and accessories. The Company generally uses
accelerated methods of depreciation for income tax purposes. g.Major
Maintenance Activities 
The
Company incurs maintenance costs on all its major equipment. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. 
h.Income
Taxes 
Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. The Company uses an estimate of its annual effective rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances
at the time while the actual effective rate is calculated at year-end. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it
is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
i.Revenue
Recognition 
The
Company recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment to the customer when collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenues related to services are recognized as earned over the
terms of the contracts or delivery of the service to the customer. 
The
Company enters into transactions that represent multiple element arrangements, which may include a combination of services and asset sales. Under EITF00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, multiple element arrangements are assessed to determine whether they can be separated into more than
one unit of accounting. A multiple element arrangement is separated into more than one unit of accounting if all of the following criteria are met. 
40 
Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued The
delivered items has value on a standalone basis;
There
is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items;
If
the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and
substantially in the control of the Company. If
these criteria are not met, then revenue is deferred until such criteria are met or until the periods over which the last undelivered element is delivered. If there is objective and
reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting in an arrangement, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each unit relative fair value.
There may be cases, however, in which there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items but no such evidence for the delivered items. In those cases, the residual
method is used to allocate the arrangement consideration. Under the residual method, the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered itemss equals the total arrangement consideration less the
aggregate fair value of the undelivered item. 
j.Research
and Development 
Research
and development costs are charged to operations in the period incurred. Such costs amounted to approximately $606,000, $886,000 and $395,000 for the years ended
December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. k.Advertising
Costs 
Advertising
and promotional costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to approximately $845,000, $757,000 and $729,000 for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. 
l.Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 
The
fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. Cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, available-for-sale securities, debt, accounts payable and accrued expenses reported in the consolidated balance sheets equal or approximate their fair values. 
m.Cash
and Cash Equivalents 
All
highly liquid financial instruments with maturities of three months or less from date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets and statements
of cash flows. 
n.Investments The
Company accounts for its investments in accordance with Statement of Accounting Standards Board SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities. Investments classified as short-term investments include the Company investments in auction-rate securities, which are classified as available-for-sale securities. Interest rates on
these auction rate securities are reset through an auction process that resets the applicable interest at pre-determined intervals every seven days. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair
value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity net of the effect of income taxes, using the specific identification
method, until they are sold. There are no unrealized gains and losses on the Company available-for-sale securities, as all available-for-sale securities are invested in auction-rate securities where
the fair market value is equivalent to cost due to the short-term nature of the investments. The Company investment in ARS securities were $130million and $200million, at
December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

o.Consignment
Inventory 
Digital
and film projection equipment is provided to potential customers for consignment and demonstration purposes. During 2007, the Company entered into operating lease agreements with
third party customers for the use of the projection equipment. Digital and film projection equipment on consignment amounted to approximately $28million and $06million at
December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
p.Earnings
Per Common Share 
The
Company computes and presents earnings per share in accordance with SFAS No128, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per share
has been computed on the basis of the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per share has been computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding after giving effect to potential
common shares from dilutive stock options. The following table provides a reconciliation between basic and diluted income per share: Years Ended December31 2007
2006

These options expire in December 2008. At December31, 2006 and 2005, options to purchase 268,800 shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $843 per share, were outstanding but not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005 as the options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of common

Compensation Plans 
Effective
January1, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement No123R, Share-Based Payment SFAS No123R. This
statement replaced FASB Statement No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Statement123 and supersedes APB No25. Statement123R and requires that all
stock-based compensation be recognized as an expense in the financial statements and that such cost be measured at the fair value of the award. This statement was adopted using the modified
prospective method of application, which requires the Company to recognize compensation cost on a prospective basis. Therefore, prior years' financial statements have not been restated. Under this
method, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense for awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January1, 2006, using the fair value amounts determined for pro forma
disclosures 
42 
Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued under
Statement123. For stock-based awards granted after January1, 2006, the Company recognizes compensation expense based on estimated grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. In a change from previous standards, Statement123R also requires that excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises be reflected as financing cash inflows. 
The
following table illustrates the effect on net income for the year ended December31, 2005 as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
Statement123R to options granted under the Company stock plans prior to adoption of Statement123R on January1, 2006. No pro forma disclosure has been made for periods
subsequent to January1, 2006 as all stock-based compensation has been recognized in net income. For purposes of this pro forma disclosure, the value of the options is estimated using a
Black-Scholes option-pricing model and amortized to expense over the options' service periods with forfeiture recognized as they occurred. 2005 Net income, as reported 4,308,897 Less pro forma stock compensation cost, net of tax benefit 91,431 Pro forma net income 4,217,466 Basic earnings per share As reported 033 Pro forma 032 Diluted earnings per share As reported 031 Pro forma 030 Share-based compensation cost that has been included in income from operations amounted to $81,325 and $106,723 for the years ended December31, 2007 and
2006. No share-based compensation cost was capitalized as a part of inventory as of December31, 2007 and 2006. 
r.Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets 
The
Company reviews long-lived assets, exclusive of goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Recoverability of
assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to
be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the
carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. 
The
Company most significant long-lived assets subject to these periodic assessments of recoverability are property, plant and equipment, which have a net book value of
$36million at December31, 2007. Because the recoverability of property, plant and equipment is based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows, these estimates may vary due to a
number of factors, some of which may be outside of management control. To the extent that the Company is unable to achieve management forecasts of future income, it may become necessary to record
impairment losses for any
excess of the net book value of property, plant and equipment over its fair value. In addition, the Company has long-lived assets which consist of the Company equity method investment in
a joint venture. The Company would recognize a loss when there is a loss in value of the equity method investment which is other than a temporary decline. No impairment existed at December31,
2007.

s.Foreign Currency Translation For
foreign operations, local currencies are considered the functional currency. The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into the United States dollar at the
foreign exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Revenue and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated using an average of the foreign exchange rates in effect during the period.
Translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are disclosed and accumulated in comprehensive income loss within the Consolidated Statements of Stockholder Equity. 
Transaction
gains and losses that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the
statements of operations as incurred. 
t.Warranty
Reserves 
The
Company generally grants a warranty to its customers for a one-year period following the sale of all new equipment, and on selected repaired equipment for a
one-year period following the repair. The warranty period is extended under certain circumstances and for certain products. The Company accrues for these costs at the time of sale, repair
or when events dictate that additional accruals are necessary. The following table summarizes warranty activity for the three years ended December31, 2007. Warranty accrual at December31, 2004 668,268 Charged to expense 342,514 Amounts written off, net of recoveries 330,765 Warranty accrual at December31, 2005 680,017 Charged to expense 160,428 Amounts written off, net of recoveries 223,393 Warranty accrual at December31, 2006 617,052 Charged to expense 170,549 Addition related to acquisition 11,639 Amounts written off, net of recoveries 417,530 Warranty accrual at December31, 2007 381,710 u.Reclassifications and Corrections in Presentation 
Certain
amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the 2007 presentation. 
In
preparing the Company consolidated financial statements fiscal 2007, the Company management determined that its historical financial statements should have presented investments
held in auction-rate securities as short-term investments and not as cash equivalents, as previously reported. The Company corrected the presentation of the auction rate securities on its Consolidated
Balance Sheets in 2006 and on its 2006 and 2005 Statements of Cash Flows, which were previously presented as cash and cash equivalents. The presentation corrected within the balance sheet totaled
$20million for 2006. The purchases and sales related to the investments held in each of the three years ended December31,
2007 have been presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the investing activities section.

v.Adoption
of New Accounting Pronouncements 
In
May 2007, the FASB issued FSP FIN48-1, Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No48. FSP FIN48-1 provides guidance on how an
enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. FSP FIN48-1 is applied
retrospectively to the Company initial adoption of FIN48 on January1, 2007. The adoption of FSP FIN48-1 did not have a material impact on the consolidated
financial statements. 
In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements
No87, 88, 106 and 132R SFAS No158. SFAS No158 requires an employer that sponsors one or more single-employer defined benefit plans to arecognize the
overfunded or underfunded status of a benefit plan in its statement of financial position, brecognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior
service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost pursuant to SFAS No87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions, or SFAS
No106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, cmeasure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer fiscal
year-end, and ddisclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from
delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. The Company adopted SFAS No158 during 2006 resulting in the recording of an
adjustment to accumulative other comprehensive income of $14,746. 
In
September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current year Financial Statements SAB
No108. SAB108 establishes a single quantification framework wherein the significance measurement is based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the financial statements as
well as the related financial statement disclosures. If a company existing methods for assessing the materiality of misstatements are not in compliance with the provisions of SAB108, the
initial application of the provisions may be adopted by restating prior period financial statements under certain circumstances or otherwise by recording the cumulative effect of initially applying
the provisions of SAB108 as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of January1, 2006 with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained
earnings. The adoption of SAB108 did not have a material effect on the Company current process for assessing and quantifying financial statement misstatements. 
On
July13, 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No109
FIN48. FIN48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
periods and disclosure. The adoption of this interpretation as of January1, 2007, did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
During
2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF Issue No06-3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should be
Presented in the Income Statement that is, gross versus net presentation for tax receipts on the face of their income statements. The scope of this guidance includes any tax assessed by a
governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, sales, use, value added and some excise taxes
gross receipts taxes are excluded. The Company has historically presented such taxes on a net basis.

Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
The
FASB has adopted SFAS No151, Inventory Costsan Amendment of ARB No43, Chapter4. The provisions of SFAS151 are intended to eliminate
narrow differences between the existing accounting standards of the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board IASB related to inventory costs, in particular, the treatment of abnormal
idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage. SFAS151 requires that these costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of the extent to which they are considered
abnormal. The provisions of SFAS151 are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS151 did not have a
significant impact on the Company results of operations, financial position or cash flows. w.Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
In
December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141 revised 2007, Business Combinations SFAS No141R. SFAS
No141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree. The provisions of SFAS No141R are effective for the Company business combinations occurring on or after January1, 2009. 
In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No159 permits entities to choose to measure
many financial assets and
financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS No159 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November15, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No159 on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
principles GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP No157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement
No157, which delayed the effective date of FASB157 for certain non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after
November15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact of adopting SFAS157 or FSP No157-2. 
3.Acquisition of National Cinema Service Corp. 
On May31, 2006, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of National Cinema Service Corp. NCSC. The total purchase price of
NCSC at the date of acquisition was $17million including cash acquired. The Company entered into an agreement to pay the former owner of NCSC, $150,000 in consideration for a
five-year covenant not to compete, of which $25,000 was paid at closing, with the remaining $125,000 being placed in escrow to be paid over five-years. The payments are
contingent upon the satisfaction of the requirement to not compete with the Company in the cinema service business over a five-year period. As of December31, 2007, $100,000
remained in the escrow account to be paid out over the remainder of the contract term. 
The
purchase price excluded an additional $05million of restricted funds that were placed in escrow for contingent payments. These contingencies related to certain aged accounts
receivable and inventories deemed to have a heightened risk of becoming obsolete and certain contingent sales tax liabilities. During 2006, the satisfaction of the terms outlined in the purchase
agreement related to aged accounts receivable, inventories and certain sales tax liabilities were satisfied, however, there are still $02million of contingencies pertaining primarily to sales
tax liabilities at December31, 2007. 
Funds
for the purchase were provided by internally generated cash flows. Direct transaction costs were not material to the transaction.

4.Investment in Digital LinkII Joint Venture 
On March6, 2007, the Company entered into an agreement with RealD to form an operating entity Digital LinkII,LLC the LLC. Under the
agreement, theLLC was formed with the Company and RealD as the only two members with membership interests of 444% and 556%, respectively. TheLLC was formed for purposes of
commercializing certain 3D technology and to fund the deployment of digital projector systems and servers to exhibitors. As of December31, 2007, total current and non-current assets of the
joint venture amounted to approximately $02million and $91million respectively. Total liabilities and equity at December31, 2007 amounted to $05million and
$88million, respectively. The joint venture reported a net loss for the period in the amount of $06million which primarily resulted from depreciation expense related to projection
equipment on consignment to third party customers. Revenues recognized during the period amounted to $002million. The
Company investment balance in the joint venture represents the retained interest in the cost basis of the projectors transferred or sold to the joint venture in addition to capital
contributions and the Company portion of equity earnings or losses in theLLC. During the first quarter of 2007, the Company transferred $62million of equipment and related services
to theLLC in exchange for a 444% ownership interest in theLLC and cash considerations. The gain on the initial transfer of equipment was approximately $02million. No revenue
was recorded in conjunction with this transaction. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company sold $26million of equipment and related services to theLLC. The Company deferred a
portion of the gross profit related to the transaction which represented 444% of total gross profit to be recorded on the sale. The additional gross profit on these transactions will be recognized
upon sale of the equipment by the joint venture to the third party exhibitors. The total investment in theLLC amounted to $37million at December31, 2007. 
The
Company accounts for its investment by the equity method. Under this method, the Company records its proportionate share of Digital LinkII net income or loss based on the
most recently available financial statements. The Company portion of losses of theLLC amounted to approximately $02million for the year ended December31, 2007. 5.Acquisition of Technobeam 
During the first quarter of 2007, the Company acquired certain assets of a business in the lighting segment from High End Systems,Inc. The results of
Technobeam operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date through the reporting period ended December31, 2007. The Company made an initial
payment of $02million. Additional consideration to be paid of up to $150,000 is contingent upon satisfaction and attainment of certain future sales of the business product line. Direct
transaction costs were not material to the acquisition. 
The
assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair values determined at the date of acquisition. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company completed the
valuation of identifiable intangible assets that resulted from the acquisition. The Company allocated $26,000 to intangibles related to the Technobeam Trademark, $51,000 relating to customer
relationships, and $12,000 relating to the non-competition agreement. In addition, the Company recorded approximately $13,000 of amortization during 2007.

deductible for tax purposes. 
6.Acquisition of Marcel Desrochers,Inc. 
On October12, 2007, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Strong Digital Systems,Inc., acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Marcel
Desrochers,Inc. MDI, a manufacturer and supplier of film and digital cinema screens, for cash consideration. The results of MDI operations have been included in the consolidated financial
statements from the acquisition date through the reporting period ended December31, 2007. As a result of the acquisition, MDI will forma core business established to supply cinema
screens to the digital and film cinema marketplace. 
The
total purchase price of MDI at the date of acquisition was $25million including cash acquired. The purchase price excluded an additional $09million of restricted
funds that were placed in escrow to secure certain indemnification and other obligation contingencies. 
Funds
for the purchase were provided by internally generated cash flows. Direct transaction costs related to the acquisition amounted to $03million. The
following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. Cash acquired 100,118 Accounts receivable 583,245 Inventories 909,789 Property and equipment 205,714 Other current assets 26,098 Amortizable intangible assets 1,658,908 Goodwill 1,193,161 Total assets acquired 4,677,033 Current liabilities 836,856 Non-current liabilities 1,012,604 Total liabilities assumed 1,849,460 Net assets acquired 2,827,573 The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair values as determined by Company management based on information
currently available and preliminary independent appraisals. Based on the preliminary analysis, $17million of acquired intangible assets is subject to amortization using a weighted-average
useful life of 47years. The allocation of the purchase price is subject to revision, which is not expected to be material, based on the final determination of appraised and other fair values.
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and are expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

year. In addition, the tables summarize the unaudited results of operations for comparable periods ended December31, 2006 as if MDI had been combined at the beginning of that period. 
The
pro forma results include estimates and assumptions which management believes are reasonable. However, the pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the results which would

During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Design
Manufacturing,Inc. Design in exchange for $17million in cash. In connection with the sale, the Company recorded a loss on the sale of $01million. 
Significant
cash outflows are expected to be recognized by the Company as a result of the continuation of activities between the Company and Design subsequent to the date of sale.
Activities primarily attributable to the expected cash outflows include the purchase of platter systems for the manufacture and sale of traditional film projection equipment. The Company expects a
continuation of activities to occur with Design over the next several years until digital cinema equipment fully replaces traditional film equipment. During the fiscal year 2007, total revenues
generated by Design as a result of sales to Ballantyne represented approximately fifty-three percent of total revenues. The Company estimates total revenues generated by Design over the next twelve
months as a result of sales to Ballantyne will be significant to total revenues generated. Therefore, due to the nature and significance of the cash inflows expected to be generated by Design as a
result of continued sales to Ballantyne, the Company has not presented the operations of Design as discontinued operations. Prior
to the sale, intercompany revenues were recorded by Design at cost. Total intercompany revenues and expenses that were eliminated prior to the sale amounted to $2,401,830 3,121,536, and $4,469,145 for the eleven months ended December31, 2007 and the twelve months ended December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Additionally, the Company will not have a
significant continuing involvement in the operations of Design after the disposal transaction. 
8.Investments 
The Company accounts for investments in accordance with Statement of Accounting Standards Board SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities. Investments classified as short term investments include the Company investments in auction-rate securities, which are classified as available-for-sale
securities. The interest rates on these auction rate securities are reset through an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals every seven days.
Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholder equity
net of the effect of income taxes, using the specific identification method, until they are sold. There are no unrealized gains or losses on the Company
available-for-sale securities, as all available-for-sale securities are invested in auction-rate securities where the fair market value is
equivalent to cost due to the short term nature of the investments.

Estimated FairValue Available-for-Sale Securities Auction-rate securities 20,000,000 20,000,000 Subsequent to year-end, the market for the Company investments in auction-rate securities began experiencing a liquidity issue when the securities came up for
auction due to an imbalance of buyers of sellers for the securities. The Company cannot predict how long the current imbalance in the auction market will continue. As a result, for a period of time,
the Company may be unable to liquidate the auction rate securities held until a successful auction occurs. However, all the securities are held within closed-end funds that continue to be AAA rated
and fully collateralized at a minimum 200% net asset to fund ratio. 
The
Company is currently evaluating the market for these securities to determine if impairment of the carrying value of the securities has occurred due to the loss of liquidity. As of
December31, 2007, the Company does not believe the investments in auction-rate securities are impaired. In the future, if indicators exist that lead to an other than temporary impairment, the
Company would recognize an impairment loss in the consolidated statement of operations. 
9.Intangible Assets  As of December31, 2007 and December31, 2006, the Company had unamortized identifiable net assets of $2,047,185 and $486,003, respectively. The

assets, other than goodwill, with definitive lives are amortized over their useful lives. 
During
2006, the Company purchased certain intangible assets pertaining to an asset purchase agreement between the Company and National Cinema Service Corporation. The assets were
recorded at fair value. Customer relationships are being amortized over useful lives of nine years and the non-competition agreement is being amortized over a useful life of five years. 
During
2007, the Company purchased certain intangible assets pertaining to an agreement between High End Systems and the Company. The assets were recorded at fair value. Customer
relationship are being amortized over a useful life of four years and non-compete intangibles are being amortized over a useful life of three years. The trademark intangible was determined
to have an indefinite life and therefore will not be amortized. 
During
2007, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary Strong Digital Systems, purchased certain intangible assets pertaining to the stock acquisition of Marcel
Desrochers,Inc. These assets were recorded at fair value. Customer relationships and the non-competition agreement are being amortized over useful lives of five years and the
trademark is being amortized over three years. 
The
Company recorded amortization expense relating to other identifiable intangible assets of $162,377, $41,224, and $23,488 for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued  10.Goodwill 
As of December31, 2007 and December31, 2006, the Company had unamortized goodwill of $2,420,993 and $1,794,426, respectively, resulting in a net
increase of $626,567. The change in goodwill resulted from an increase in goodwill of $1,175,033 related to the acquisition of Marcel Desrochers,Inc. In addition, an increase in goodwill of
$91,000 resulted from the purchase of certain assets of a business in the lighting segment. The increase was offset by a decrease of $639,466 which resulted from impairment charges related to a
reporting unit within the Theatre segment which is discussed in the following paragraphs. As
of December31, 2006 and December31, 2005, the Company had unamortized goodwill of $1,794,426 and $2,467,219, respectively, resulting in a net decrease of $672,793. The
change in goodwill resulted from an increase in goodwill of $577,741 from the acquisition of National Cinema Service Corporation. The increase was offset by a decrease of $1,250,534 which resulted
from impairment charges related to a reporting unit within the Theatre segment which is discussed in the following paragraphs. 
Goodwill
represents the excess of cost over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired through purchase business combinations in accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill and intangible assets that are determined to have
an indefinite useful life are not amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually as well as when events and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Certain factors
that may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include, but are not limited to, operating results that are lower than expected and adverse industry or market economic trends. 
The
impairment testing requires management to estimate the fair value of the assets or reporting unit. The estimate of the fair value of the assets is determined on the basis of
discounted cash flows. In estimating the fair value, management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows, future revenues, future earnings in addition to other
factors. The fair value of the reporting unit is then compared to the carrying amount of the assets to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date for the excess of the carrying amount of
the reporting unit assets over the fair value of the reporting unit assets. 
As
a result of an analysis conducted during the 2006 review of goodwill pursuant to SFAS No142, Ballantyne recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $1,250,534 on a
portion of the Company goodwill pertaining to a reporting unit within the Theatre segment. As
a result of an analysis conducted during the second quarter of 2007 pursuant to SFAS No142, Ballantyne recorded an additional pretax impairment charge of $639,466 related to
the same reporting unit within the theatre segment which reduced the goodwill attributable to this unit to zero. The analysis took into consideration the ongoing transition taking place in the
Company strategy and operations, moving from the manufacture of traditional film equipment to a business model focused on the distribution and service of digital projectors. Accordingly, the Company
has taken a 2007 non-cash charge amounting to $06million see above, or $003 per diluted share after tax. The effect of the charge has been to reduce 2007 reported net income
and EPS.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Based on the Company assessment of estimated future taxable income, management considers whether it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
Federal
and state income taxes have not been provided on accumulated but undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately $02million at
December31, 2007 as such earnings have been permanently reinvested in the business. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed
earnings is not practicable. 
The
Company adopted the provisions of FIN48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes as amended, effective January1,
2007. The Company uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant taxable authorities. The Company has examinations not yet initiated for Federal
purposes for fiscal years 2004 through 2006. In most cases, the Company has examinations open for State or local jurisdictions based on the particular jurisdiction statute of limitations. The
Company does not currently have any examinations in process. As of January1, 2007, the Company had $03million of unrecognized tax benefits. If recognized, the tax benefits would be
recorded as a component of income tax expense. 
Estimated
amounts related to estimated underpayment of income taxes, including interest and penalties, are classified as a component of tax expense in the consolidated statements of
operations and were not material for the year ended December31, 2007. Amounts accrued for estimated underpayment of income taxes amounted to $03million as of January1, 2007
and $02million as of December31, 2007, respectively. The accruals largely related to state tax matters.

December31, 2007, $441,415 is due from Digital Link. Only the payments received in 2007 and 2006 on the note receivable totaling $338,585 were recorded as revenue with the remaining amounts to
be recognized as revenue in future periods when payment is received from Digital Link as described in the note receivable arrangement or when collections from the Digital Link can be reasonably
assured. Additionally, until collections from Digital Link can be reasonably assured, no receivable will be recorded in relation to this transaction. The costs incurred with the sale of projectors to
Digital Link were expensed during 2006 with no future associated costs to be incurred.

Options 
The Company currently maintains a 2001 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan 2001 Directors Plan which has not been approved by the Company
stockholders. The plan is administered by the Board of Directors and exists to provide incentive to non-employee directors to serve on the Board and exert their best efforts. The 2001
Director Plan provides an option to purchase common stock in lieu of all or part of the retainer paid to Directors for their services. The Board of Directors fix the amount of the retainer fee for
the coming year at least thirty days prior to beginning of plan year. At that time, each non-employee director may elect to receive stock options for all or part of the retainer fee to be
provided. 
In
addition, the Company currently maintains a 2005 Outside Directors Stock Option Plan 2005 Outside Directors Plan which has been approved by the Company stockholders. The Company
also maintained a 1995 Employee Stock Option Plan and a 1995 Directors Stock Plan which both expired in 2005, however, there are outstanding stock options remaining under these two expired plans. 
All
past and future grants under the Company stock option plans were granted at prices based on the fair market value of the Company common stock on the date of grant. The
outstanding options generally vest over periods ranging from zero to three years from the grant date and expire between 5 and 10years after the grant date. 
56 
Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued All
options granted under the 2001 Directors Plan and the 1995 Employee Stock Option Plan were fully vested, based on their original terms, prior to January1, 2006. As such, no
compensation expense related to those options has been recognized under SFAS No123R. The 1995 Outside Directors Stock Plan had 47,250 shares outstanding not yet vested at January1,
2006 and were subject to the recognition of compensation expense. The Company currently uses authorized and unissued shares to satisfy share award exercises. 
A
total of 1,105,690 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company stock option plans for directors at December31, 2007. On
January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No123R, Share Based Payments SFAS No123R. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No123R, the Company
records compensation expense for stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. The Company uses historical data among other factors to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate. The
risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option. The Company has not and is not expected to pay cash dividends in the
future. The Company policy is to record the fair value of the options to selling, general and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. No
stock options were granted during the year ended December31, 2007. The Company granted 47,250 stock options during the year ended December31, 2006. 
The

benefits expected to be paid in the five years from 2013-2017 are $114,130.
The expected benefits are based on the same assumptions used to measure the Company benefit obligation at December31 and include estimated future employee service. 
In
December 2003, the United States enacted into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act. The Act established a prescription drug
benefit under Medicare, known as Medicare PartD and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retired healthcare benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to
Medicare PartD. On May19, 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS-106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 FSP-106-2, which requires measures of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit
costs to reflect the effects of the Act in the first interim or annual period beginning after June15, 2004. On January21, 2005, final regulations under the Act were issued. The effects
of the Act did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company. d.Concentrations 
The
Company top ten customers accounted for approximately 43% of 2007 consolidated net revenues. The top ten customers were primarily from the theatre segment. Trade accounts
receivable from these customers represented approximately 51% of net consolidated receivables at December31, 2007. Sales to AMC Theatres,Inc. represented approximately 10% of
consolidated sales. Additionally, receivables from Vari International represented over 10% of net consolidated receivables at December31, 2007. While the Company believes its relationships
with such customers are stable, most arrangements are made by purchase order and are terminable at will by either party. A significant decrease or interruption in business from the Company
significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company could also be adversely affected by such factors as
changes in foreign currency rates and weak economic and political conditions in each of the countries in which the Company sells its products. 
Financial
instruments that potentially expose the Company to a concentration of credit risk principally consist of accounts receivable. The Company sells product to a large number of
customers in many different geographic regions. To minimize credit concentration risk, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition.

e.Leases The
Company and its subsidiaries lease plant and office facilities, furniture, autos and equipment under operating leases expiring through 2012. These leases generally contain renewal
options and the Company expects to renew or replace the leases in the ordinary course of business. Rent expense under operating lease agreements amounted to approximately $126,000, $61,000 and $74,000
for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 
As
part of the acquisition of Marcel Desrochers,Inc. on October12, 2007, MDI entered into an operating lease agreement for the manufacturing facilities located in Canada
which are primarily used for the manufacture of motion picture theatre screens. The term of the lease is for sixty months which expires on October12, 2012. 
Future
minimum lease payments for operating leases having initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of December31, 2007 are as follows:
2008$333,139; 2009$288,733; 2010$285,295; 2011$285,295; and 2012$223,174. 
f.Self-Insurance The
Company is self-insured up to certain stop loss limits for group health insurance. Accruals for claims incurred but not paid as of December31, 2007 and 2006 are
included in accrued group health insurance claims in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company policy is to accrue the employee health benefit accruals based on historical
information along with certain assumptions about future events. g.Litigation 
Ballantyne
is currently a defendant in an asbestos case entitled Larry C. Stehman and Leila Stehman v. Asbestos Corporation, Limited and Ballantyne of
Omaha,Inc. individually and as successor in interest to Strong International, Strong Electric Corporation and Century Projector Corporation, et al, filed
December8, 2006 in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Francisco. We believe that we have strong defenses and intend to defend the suit vigorously. It is not possible
at this time to predict the outcome of this case, or the amount of damages, if any, that a jury may award. The plaintiffs have made no monetary demand upon Ballantyne. This case is scheduled for trial
in August 2008. It is possible that an adverse resolution of this case could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. 
During
March 2006, Ballantyne settled an asbestos case entitled Bercu v. BICC Cables Corporation, et al., originally filed June27,
2003 in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. The settlement amount was not material to the Company results of operations, financial position or cash flow. 
Ballantyne
is a party to various other legal actions which are ordinary routine litigation matters incidental to the Company business, such as products liability. Based on currently
available information, management believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company results of operations,
financial position or cash flows. 
h.Environmental The
Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to environmental protection and the discharge of material into the environment. During 2001,
Ballantyne was informed by a neighboring company of likely contaminated soil on certain parcels of land adjacent to Ballantyne main manufacturing facility in Omaha, Nebraska. The Environmental
Protection Agency and the Nebraska Health and Human Services System subsequently determined that certain parcels of 
64 
Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued Ballantyne
property had various levels of contaminated soil relating to a former pesticide company which previously owned the property and that burned down in the 1960. During October 2004,
Ballantyne agreed to enter into an Administrative Order on Consent AOC to resolve the matter. The AOC holds Ballantyne and two other parties jointly and severally responsible for the cleanup. In
this regard, the three parties have also entered into a Site Allocation Agreement by which they will divide past, current and future costs of the EPA, the costs of remediation and the cost of long
term maintenance. In connection with the AOC, the Company has paid its share of the costs. At December31, 2007, the Company has provided for management estimate of any future payments
relating to this matter which is not material to the consolidated financial statements. 21.Business Segment Information 
The presentation of segment information reflects the manner in which management organizes segments for making operating decisions and assessing performance. As of
December31, 2007, the Company operations were conducted principally through two business segments: Theatre and Lighting. Theatre operations include the design, manufacture, assembly, sale
and service of motion picture projectors, xenon lamphouses and power supplies. Theatre operations also include the sale and service of digital projection equipment and accessories, sound systems,
xenon lamps and lenses. The lighting segment operations include the design, manufacture, assembly and sale of follow spotlights, stationary searchlights and computer operated lighting systems for the
motion picture production, television, live entertainment, theme parks and architectural industries. The Company allocates resources to business segments and evaluates the performance of these
segments based upon reported segment gross profit. However, certain key operations of a particular segment are tracked on the basis of operating profit. All intercompany sales are eliminated in
consolidation.

1.Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company
management, including the Company Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company disclosure controls and procedures, as
defined in Exchange Act Rules13a-15 eand 15d-15e and internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act
Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f. Based upon that evaluation, the Company Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in enabling the Company to record, process, summarize and report information required to be included in the Company periodic SEC filings within the required
time period. 
2.Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
aManagement Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
The Company management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Securities
Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. The Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company management, including the Company Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting. The Company management used the framework in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO to perform this evaluation. Based on that evaluation, the Company management concluded that the Company
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2007. The
effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007 has been audited by KPMGLLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report, a copy of which is included in this Annual Report on Form10-K. 
The
Company acquired Marcel Desrochers,Inc. MDI during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, MDI internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $58million and total revenues of
$10million included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December31, 2007. The exclusion is primarily due to the timing of the
acquisition and the foreign location of operations.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Board
of Directors and Stockholders
Ballantyne of Omaha, Inc.: 
We
have audited Ballantyne of Omaha, Inc. the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Ballantyne of
Omaha, Inc. management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over 
71  financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. 
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In
our opinion, Ballantyne of Omaha, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria
established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Ballantyne
of Omaha, Inc. acquired Marcel Desrochers, Inc. during 2007, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of Ballantyne of Omaha, Inc. internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, Marcel Desrochers, Inc. internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $58 million and total revenues of $10
million included in the consolidated financial statements of Ballantyne of Omaha, Inc. and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December31, 2007. Our audit of internal control over
financial reporting of Ballantyne of Omaha, Inc. also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the Marcel Desrochers, Inc. We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Ballantyne of Omaha, Inc. as
of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December31, 2007,
and our report dated April1, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. s/
