Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting of the Company. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013. In making this evaluation, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control1992 Integrated Framework. Based on managements evaluation and those criteria, management concluded that the Companys system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2013. Management has excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at A.M. Holding S.A.S., which was acquired on April 10, 2013, and whose financial statements constitute 13 percent of total assets, two percent of revenues and one percent of operating income on the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013. Managements internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on the following page, in which they expressed an unqualified opinion. /S/  SCOTTW.

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1.Organization and Significant Accounting PoliciesPolaris Industries Inc. Polaris or the Company, a Minnesota corporation, and its subsidiaries are engaged in the design, engineering, manufacturing and marketing of innovative, high-quality, high-performance Off-Road Vehicles ORV, Snowmobiles, Motorcycles and Small Vehicles SV. Polaris products, together with related parts, garments and accessories are sold worldwide through a network of independent dealers and distributors and its subsidiaries. The primary markets for our products are the United States, Canada and Western Europe. Basis of presentation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Polaris and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Income from financial services is reported as a component of operating income to better reflect income from ongoing operations, of which financial services has a significant impact.On September 2, 2004, the Company announced its decision to discontinue the manufacture of marine products effective immediately. Material financial results for the marine products division are reported separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented.The Company evaluates consolidation of entities under Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic810. This Topic requires management to evaluate whether an entity or interest is a variable interest entity and whether the company is the primary beneficiary. Polaris used the guidelines to analyze the Companys relationships, including its relationship with Polaris Acceptance, and concluded that there were no variable interest entities requiring consolidation by the Company in 2013, 2012and 2011. In April 2013, the Company completed an acquisition of A.M. Holding S.A.S., which operates under the name Aixam Mega S.A.S. Aixam. The Company has included the financial results of the acquisition in its consolidated results of operations beginning on the acquisition date; however, the acquisition did not have a material impact on Polaris consolidated financial position or results of operations. Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding the acquisition of Aixam.Reclassifications. Certain reclassifications of previously reported balance sheet amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation. The reclassifications had no impact on the consolidated statements of income, current assets or current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, as previously reported. Use of estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Ultimate results could differ from those estimates.Fair value measurements. Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified using the following hierarchy, which is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation as of the measurement date: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. In making fair value measurements, observable market data must be used when available. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company utilizes the market approach to measure fair value for its non-qualified deferred compensation assets and liabilities, and the income approach for the interest rate swap agreements, foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable 48Table of Contentsassets or liabilities, and for the income approach the Company uses significant other observable inputs to value its derivative instruments used to hedge interest rate volatility, foreign currency and commodity transactions. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below in thousands:Fair Value Measurements as of December 31, 2013Asset LiabilityTotalLevel 1Level2Level3Commodity contracts, net$30$30Non-qualified deferred compensation assets24,711$24,711Total assets at fair value$24,741$24,711$30Foreign exchange contracts, net$9$9Non-qualified deferred compensation  liabilities at fair  Value Measurements as of December 31, 2012Asset LiabilityTotalLevel 1Level2Level3Non-qualified deferred compensation assets$15,872$15,872Total assets at fair value$15,872$15,872Foreign exchange contracts, net$2,617$2,617Commodity contracts, net124124Non-qualified deferred compensation  liabilities at fair  measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of acquisitions are measured at fair value. Refer to Note 5 for additional information. Polaris will impair or write off an investment and recognize a loss when events or circumstances indicate there is impairment in the investment that is other-than-temporary. The amount of loss is determined by measuring the investment at fair value. Refer to Note 9 for additional information.Cash equivalents. Polaris considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 90days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. Such investments consist principally of money market mutual funds. Allowance for doubtful accounts. Polaris financial exposure to collection of accounts receivable is limited due to its agreements with certain finance companies. For receivables not serviced through these finance companies, the Company provides a reserve for doubtful accounts based on historical rates and trends. This reserve is adjusted periodically as information about specific accounts becomes available. Inventories. Inventory costs include material, labor, and manufacturing overhead costs, including depreciation expense associated with the manufacture and distribution of the Company products. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market. The major components of inventories are as follows in thousands: December 31, 2013December 31, 2012Raw materials and purchased  parts, garments and  goods206,290196,691Less:  in finance affiliate. The caption investment in finance affiliate in the consolidated balance sheets represents Polaris fiftypercent equity interest in Polaris Acceptance, a partnership agreement between GE Commercial Distribution Finance Corporation GECDF and one of Polaris wholly-owned subsidiaries. Polaris Acceptance provides floor plan financing to Polaris dealers in the United States. Polaris investment in Polaris Acceptance is accounted for under the equity method, and is recorded as investment in finance affiliate in the consolidated balance 49Table of Contentssheets. Polaris allocable share of the income of Polaris Acceptance and the Securitized Receivables has been included as a component of income from financial services in the consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note8 for additional information regarding Polaris investment in Polaris Acceptance. Investment in other affiliates. The caption investment in other affiliates in the consolidated balance sheets represents the Companys investment in nonmarketable securities of strategic companies. For each investment, Polaris assesses the level of influence in determining whether to account for the investment under the cost method or equity method. For equity method investments, Polaris proportionate share of income or losses is recorded in the consolidated statements of income. Polaris will write down or write off an investment and recognize a loss if and when events or circumstances indicate there is impairment in the investment that is other-than-temporary. Refer to Note9 for additional information regarding Polaris investment in other affiliates. Property and equipment. Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the respective assets, ranging from 10-40years for buildings and improvements and from 1-7years for equipment and tooling. Depreciation of assets recorded under capital leases is included with depreciation expense. Fully depreciated tooling is eliminated from the accounting records annually. Goodwill and other intangible assets. ASC Topic 350 prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Topic 350 requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually. An impairment charge for goodwill is recognized only when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, is less than its carrying amount. Refer to Note5 for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets. Revenue recognition.Revenues are recognized at the time of shipment to the dealer or distributor or other customers. Product returns, whether in the normal course of business or resulting from repossession under the Company customer financing program see Note 8, have not been material. Polaris sponsors certain sales incentive programs and accrues liabilities for estimated sales promotion expenses and estimated holdback amounts that are recognized as reductions to sales when products are sold to the dealer or distributor customer. Sales promotions and incentives. Polaris provides for estimated sales promotion and incentive expenses, which are recognized as a reduction to sales, at the time of sale to the dealer or distributor. Examples of sales promotion and incentive programs include dealer and consumer rebates, volume incentives, retail financing programs and sales associate incentives. Sales promotion and incentive expenses are estimated based on current programs and historical rates for each product line. Actual results may differ from these estimates if market conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if the customer usage rate varies from historical trends. Historically, sales promotion and incentive expenses have been within the Companys expectations and differences have not been material. Dealer holdback programs.Dealer holdback represents a portion of the invoiced sales price that is expected to be subsequently returned to the dealer or distributor as a sales incentive upon the ultimate retail sale of the product. Holdback amounts reduce the ultimate net price of the products purchased by Polaris dealers or distributors and, therefore, reduce the amount of sales Polaris recognizes at the time of shipment. The portion of the invoiced sales price estimated as the holdback is recognized as dealer holdback liability on the Companys balance sheet until paid or forfeited. The minimal holdback adjustments in the estimated holdback liability due to forfeitures are recognized in net sales. Payments are made to dealers or distributors at various times during the year subject to previously established criteria. Shipping and handling costs. Polaris records shipping and handling costs as a component of cost of sales at the time the product is shipped. Research and development expenses. Polaris records research and development expenses in the period in which they are incurred as a component of operating expenses. Advertising expenses. Polaris records advertising expenses as a component of selling and marketing expenses in the period in which they are incurred. In the years ended December31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, Polaris incurred $73,945,000, $58,752,000, and $48,877,000, respectively. Product warranties. Polaris provides a limited warranty for its ORVs for a period of six months and for a period of one year for its snowmobiles and motorcycles and a two year period for SVs. Polaris provides longer warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and market conditions and may also provide longer warranties related to certain promotional programs. Polaris standard warranties require the Company or its dealers to repair or 50Table of Contentsreplace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer. The warranty reserve is established at the time of sale to the dealer or distributor based on managements best estimate using historical rates and trends.Adjustments to the warranty reserve are made from time to time as actual claims become known in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date. Factors that could have an impact on the warranty accrual in any given period include the following: improved manufacturing quality, shifts in product mix, changes in warranty coverage periods, snowfall and its impact on snowmobile usage, product recalls and any significant changes in sales volume. The activity in the warranty reserve during the periods presented was as follows in thousands: For the Years Ended December 31,201320122011Balance at beginning of year  to warranty reserve through  charged to expense  56,85746,08846,217Warranty claims paid   at end of year   employee compensation. For purposes of determining the estimated fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant under ASC Topic 718, Polaris uses the Black-Scholes Model. The Black-Scholes Model requires the input of certain assumptions that require judgment. Because employee stock options and restricted stock awards have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the employee stock options or restricted stock awards. Management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of share-based compensation. Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact the fair value determination. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of Topic 718 in future periods, the compensation expense that was recorded under Topic 718may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period. Refer to Note2 for additional information regarding share-based compensation. The Company estimates the likelihood and the rate of achievement for performance sensitive share-based awards. Changes in the estimated rate of achievement and fluctuation in the market based stock price can have a significant effect on reported share-based compensation expenses as the effect of a change in the estimated achievement level and fluctuation in the market based stock price is recognized in the period that the likelihood factor and stock price changes. If adjustments in the estimated rate of achievement and fluctuation in the market based stock price are made, they would be reflected in our gross margin and operating expenses. Derivative instruments and hedging activities. Changes in the fair value of a derivative are recognized in earnings unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge. To qualify as a hedge, the Company must formally document, designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting. Polaris enters into foreign exchange contracts to manage currency exposures from certain of its purchase commitments denominated in foreign currencies and transfers of funds from time to time from its foreign subsidiaries. Polaris does not use any financial contracts for trading purposes. These contracts met the criteria for cash flow hedges. Gains and losses on the Canadian dollar, Norwegian Krone, Swedish Krona and Australian dollar contracts at settlement are recorded in non-operating other income in the consolidated income statements, and gains and losses on the Japanese yen, Mexican peso and Euro contracts at settlement are recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated income statements. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.Polaris is subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain purchased commodity raw materials including steel, aluminum, diesel fuel, and petroleum-based resins. In addition, the Company purchases components and parts containing various commodities, including steel, aluminum, rubber, rare earth metals and others which are integrated into the Companys end products. While such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers, commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. The Company generally buys these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process. From time to time, Polaris utilizes derivative contracts to hedge a portion of the exposure to commodity risks. During 2013and 2012, the Company entered into derivative contracts to hedge a portion of the exposure for diesel fuel and aluminum. The Company diesel fuel and 51Table of Contentsaluminum hedging contracts do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting and therefore, the resulting unrealized gains and losses from those contracts are included in the consolidated statements of income in cost of sales.

The Company grants long-term equity-based incentives and rewards for the benefit of its employees and directors under the shareholder approved Polaris Industries Inc. 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan as amended the Omnibus Plan, which were previously provided under several separate incentive and compensatory plans. Upon approval by the shareholders of the Omnibus Plan in April 2007, the Polaris Industries Inc. 1995 Stock Option Plan Option Plan, the 1999 Broad Based Stock Option Plan Broad Based Plan, the Restricted Stock Plan Restricted Plan and the 2003 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan Director Stock Option Plan and collectively the Prior Plans were frozen and no further grants or awards have since been or will be made under such plans. A maximum of 13,500,000shares of common stock are available for issuance under the Omnibus Plan, together with additional shares canceled or forfeited under the Prior Plans. Stock option awards granted to date under the Omnibus Plan generally vest twoto fouryears from the award date and expire after ten years. In addition, since 2007, the Company has granted a total of 129,000deferred stock units to its non-employee directors under the Omnibus Plan 12,000, 12,000and 16,000in 2013, 2012and 2011, respectively which will be converted into common stock when the directors board service ends or upon a change in control. Restricted shares awarded under the Omnibus Plan to date generally contain restrictions which lapse after a two to four year period if Polaris achieves certain performance measures. The Option Plan, which is frozen, was used to issue incentive and nonqualified stock options to certain employees. Options granted to date generally vest threeyears from the award date and expire after tenyears. The Director Stock Option Plan, which is frozen and contains no unexercised awards as of December 31, 2013, was used to issue nonqualified stock options to non-employee directors. Under the Polaris Industries Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors Director Plan, members of the Board of Directors who are not Polaris officers or employees may annually elect to receive common stock equivalents in lieu of directors fees, which will be converted into common stock when board service ends. A maximum of 500,000shares of common stock has been authorized under this plan of which 117,000equivalents have been earned and an additional 52Table of Contents357,000shares have been issued to retired directors as of December31, 2013. As of December31, 2013and 2012, Polaris liability under the plan totaled $17,031,000and $19,699,000, respectively. Polaris maintains a long term incentive program under which awards are issued to provide incentives for certain employees to attain and maintain the highest standards of performance and to attract and retain employees of outstanding competence and ability with no cash payments required from the recipient. Awards granted through 2011 are paid in cash and are based on certain Company performance measures that are measured over a period of three consecutive calendar years. At the beginning of the plan cycle, participants had the option to receive a cash value at the time of awards or a cash value tied to Polaris stock price movement over the three year plan cycle. At December31, 2013and 2012, Polaris liability under the plan totaled $57,166,000and $66,586,000, respectively. Beginning in 2012, long term incentive program awards are granted in restricted stock units and therefore treated as equity awards. All remaining conditions of the long term incentive program remained the same as prior to 2012.Share-based compensation expense. The amount of compensation cost for share-based awards to be recognized during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. The Company estimates stock option forfeitures at the time of grant and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company analyzes historical data to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures and records share compensation expense for those awards expected to vest. Total share-based compensation expenses were as follows in thousands:For the Years Ended December 31,201320122011Option plan  $22,245$16,497$9,948Other share-based awards  57,64056,77063,872Total share-based compensation before tax  79,88573,26773,820Tax benefit  29,83527,40127,929Total share-based compensation expense included in net income  $50,050$45,866$45,891These share-based compensation expenses are reflected in cost of sales and operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. For purposes of determining the estimated fair value of option awards on the date of grant under ASC Topic 718, Polaris has used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Assumptions utilized in the model are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and experience. At December31, 2013, there was $61,414,000of total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested share-based equity awards. Unrecognized share-based compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 148years. Included in unrecognized share-based compensation is approximately $34,037,000related to stock options and $27,377,000for restricted stock. 53Table of ContentsGeneral stock option and restricted stock information.

Polaris sponsors a qualified non-leveraged ESOP under which a maximum of 7,200,000shares of common stock can be awarded. The shares are allocated to eligible participants accounts based on total cash compensation earned during the calendar year. An employee ESOP account vests equally after two and three years of service and require no cash payments from the recipient. Participants may instruct Polaris to pay respective dividends directly to the participant in cash or reinvest the dividends into the participants ESOP accounts. Substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the ESOP, with the exception of Company officers. Total expense related to the ESOP was $9,224,000, $7,380,000, and $7,011,000, in 2013, 2012and 2011, respectively. As of December31, 2013there were 4,142,000shares vested in the plan. Defined contribution plans. Polaris sponsors various defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. For the 401k defined contribution retirement plan which covers the majority of U.S. employees, the Company matches 100 percentof employee contributions up to a maximum of five percent of eligible compensation. All contributions vest immediately. The cost of these defined contribution retirement plans was $10,651,000, $9,318,000, and $8,456,000, in 2013, 2012and 2011, respectively. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP. Polaris sponsors a SERP that provides executive officers of the Company an alternative to defer portions of their salary, cash incentive compensation, and Polaris matching contributions. The deferrals and contributions are held in a rabbi trust and are in funds to match the liabilities of the plan. The assets are recorded as trading assets. The assets of the rabbi trust are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and the SERP liability is included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The asset and liability balance are both $24,711,000and $15,872,000at December31, 2013, and 2012, respectively. In November 2013, Polaris amended the SERP to allow executive officers of the Company the opportunity to defer restricted stock awards beginning with the annual performance-based award, which is scheduled to vest in February 2015 if certain performance metrics are achieved. After a holding period, the executive officer has the option to diversify the vested award into other funds available under the SERP. The deferrals will be held in a rabbi trust and will be invested in funds to match the liabilities of the SERP. The awards are redeemable in Polaris stock or in cash based upon the occurrence of events not solely within the control of Polaris; therefore, awards probable of vesting, for which the executive has not yet made an election to defer, or awards that have been deferred but have not yet vested and are probable of vesting or have been diversified into other funds are reported as deferred compensation in the temporary equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. The awards recorded in temporary equity are recognized at fair value as though the reporting date is also the redemption date, with any difference from stock-based compensation recorded in retained earnings. At December31, 2013, 57,821shares are recorded at a fair value of $8,421,000in temporary equity, which includes $4,358,000of compensation cost and $4,063,000of cumulative fair value adjustment recorded through retained earnings.Note4.Financing AgreementBank financing. In August 2011, Polaris entered into a $350,000,000unsecured revolving loan facility. In January 2013, Polaris amended the loan facility to provide more beneficial covenant and interest rate terms and extend the expiration date from August 2016 to January 2018. Interest is charged at rates based on LIBOR or prime. At December31, 2013, borrowings under the revolving loan facility totaled $80,500,000. There were no borrowings under the revolving loan facility at December31, 2012. In December 2010, the Company entered into a Master Note Purchase Agreement to issue $25,000,000of 381 percentunsecured senior notes due May 2018and $75,000,000of 460 percentunsecured senior notes due May 2021collectively, the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes were issued in May 2011. In December 2013, the Company entered into a First Supplement to Master Note Purchase Agreement, under which the Company issued $100,000,000of 313 percentunsecured senior notes due December 2020. At December31, 2013and 2012, outstanding borrowings under the amended Master Note Purchase Agreement totaled $200,000,000and $100,000,000, respectively55Table of ContentsThe unsecured revolving loan facility and the amended Master Note Purchase Agreement contain covenants that require Polaris to maintain certain financial ratios, including minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios. Polaris was in compliance with all such covenants as of December31, 2013.The Company entered into and settled an interest rate lock contract in November 2009 in connection with the Master Note Purchase Agreement. The interest rate lock settlement resulted in a $251,000gain, net of deferred taxes of $149,000, which will be amortized into income over the life of the related debt.

Letters of credit:At December31, 2013, Polaris had open letters of credit totaling $19,102,000. The amounts are primarily related to inventory purchases and are reduced as the purchases are received. Dealer financing programs:Certain finance companies, including Polaris Acceptance, an affiliate see Note8, provide floor plan financing to dealers on the purchase of Polaris products. The amount financed by worldwide dealers under these arrangements at December31, 2013, was approximately $1,163,545,000. Polaris has agreed to repurchase products repossessed by the finance companies up to an annual maximum of no more than 15 percentof the average month-end balances outstanding during the prior calendar year. Polaris financial exposure under these arrangements is limited to the difference between the amount paid to the finance companies for repurchases and the amount received on the resale of the repossessed product. No material losses have been incurred under these agreements during the periods presented. As a part of its marketing program, Polaris contributes to the cost of dealer financing up to certain limits and subject to certain conditions. Such expenditures are included as an offset to sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Note5.Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ASC Topic 350 prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Topic 350 requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually. An impairment charge for goodwill is recognized only when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, is less than its carrying amount. The Company performed the annual impairment test as of December31, 2013and 2012. The results of the impairment test indicated that no goodwill or intangible impairment existed as of the test date. The Company has had no historical impairments of goodwill. In accordance with Topic 350, the Company will continue to complete an impairment analysis on an annual basis or more frequently if an event or circumstance that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount occurs. Goodwill and other intangible assets, net, consist of $126,697,000and $56,324,000of goodwill and $103,011,000and $50,892,000of intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, for the periods ended December31, 2013and 2012, respectively. Additions to goodwill and other intangible assets in 2013 relate primarily to the acquisition of A.M. Holding S.A.S., which operates under the name Aixam Mega S.A.S. Aixam, on April 10, 2013. Aixam manufactures and sells enclosed on-road quadricycles and light duty commercial vehicles. The acquisition strengthens Polaris' SV portfolio and enhances the profitability and growth potential of Polaris in Europe. Aixam financial results are included in the Companys consolidated results from the date of acquisition. Pro forma financial results are not presented as the acquisition is not material to the consolidated financial statements. The acquisition of Aixam for $141,189,000, which was funded with cash on hand, was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Net of cash acquired, the Aixam purchase price was $134,817,000. 56Table of ContentsThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the for the years ended December31, 2013and 2012are as follows in thousands:20132012Balance as of beginning of year$56,324$44,668Goodwill acquired during the period66,08511,061Currency translation effect on foreign goodwill balances  4,288595Balance as of end of year$126,697$56,324For other intangible assets, the changes in the net carrying amount for the years ended December31, 2013and 2012are as follows in thousands:For the Year Ended December 31, 2013For the Year Ended December 31, 2012Gross AmountAccumulated AmortizationGross AmountAccumulated AmortizationOther intangible assets, beginning   assets acquired during the  expense  9,1782,787Currency translation effect on foreign balances3,9847528222Other intangible assets, ending   components of other intangible assets were as follows in thousands:December 31, 2013EstimatedLife YearsGrossCarrying AmountAccumulated AmortizationNetNon-compete agreements   related  759,2448,60850,636Developed technology  5-715,3074,47510,832Total amortizable   names  41,18841,188Total other intangible assets, net   31, 2012EstimatedLife YearsGrossCarrying AmountAccumulated AmortizationNetNon-compete  related  714,7021,65013,052Developed technology  5-712,9742,28810,686Total amortizable   names  26,69126,691Total other intangible assets, net   expense for intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2013and 2012was $9,178,000and $2,787,000.

As a result, the impact of both the 2012 and 2013 research and development tax credits were recorded in the 2013 tax provision. Undistributed earnings relating to certain non-U.S. subsidiaries of approximately $75,487,000and $56,812,000at December31, 2013and 2012, respectively, are considered to be permanently reinvested; accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal income taxes has been provided thereon. If the Company were to distribute these earnings, it would be subject to both U.S. income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits reflecting the amounts paid to non-U.S. taxing authorities and withholding taxes payable to the non-U.S. countries. Determination of the unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable due to the complexities associated with this hypothetical calculation. 58Table of ContentsPolaris utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws. The net deferred income taxes consist of the following in thousands:December 31,20132012Current deferred income taxes:Inventories  $6,306$7,277Accrued expenses  87,15778,164Derivative instruments  107851Total current  93,35686,292Noncurrent deferred income taxes:Cost in excess of net assets of business acquired  13,5945,193Property and equipment  36,06921,656Compensation payable in common stock  42,38540,329Net unrealized gains in other comprehensive income  1431,698Net operating loss carryforwards  5,7824,744Valuation allowance  5,0594,523Total noncurrent  6,41222,389Total net deferred income tax asset$86,944$108,681At December31, 2013, the Company had available unused international and acquired federal net operating loss carryforwards of $21,137,000. The net operating loss carryforwards will primarily expire at various dates from 2014 to 2020, with certain jurisdictions having indefinite carryforward terms.Polaris classified liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as long-term income taxes payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Polaris recognizes potential interest and penalties related to income tax positions as a component of the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of income. Reserves related to potential interest are recorded as a component of long-term income taxes payable. The entire balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2013, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate. The Company does not anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next twelve months. Tax years 2010through 2013remain open to examination by certain tax jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in thousands:For the Years Ended December 31,20132012Balance at January1,  $6,704$7,341Increases due to acquisition opening balance sheet positions6,420Gross increases for tax positions of prior years  56183Gross increases for tax positions of current year  3,755938Decreases due to settlements  3,3101,658Decreases for lapse of statute of limitations  1,344Currency translation effect on foreign balances413Balance at December31,  13,1996,704Reserves related to potential interest at December 31,1,093359Unrecognized tax benefits at December  Equity Stock repurchase program.The Polaris Board of Directors has authorized the cumulative repurchase of up to 75,000,000shares of the Companys common stock. In addition, in 2013 the Polaris Board of Directors authorized the one-time repurchase of all the shares of Polaris stock owned by Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. Fuji. On November 12, 2013, Polaris entered into and executed a Share Repurchase Agreement with Fuji pursuant to which Polaris purchased 3,960,000shares of Polaris stock held by Fuji for an aggregate purchase price of $497,474,000. As of December31, 2013, 1,604,000shares remain available for repurchases under the Boards authorization. During 2013, Polaris paid $530,033,000to repurchase and retire approximately4,337,000shares.

Under the plan, a dividend of preferred stock purchase rights will become exercisable if a person or group should acquire 15 percentor more of the Companys stock. The dividend will consist of onepurchase right for each outstanding share of the Companys common stock held by shareholders of record on June1, 2000. The shareholder rights plan was amended and restated in April 2010. The amended and restated rights agreement extended the final expiration date of the rights from May 2010 to April 2020, expanded the definition of Beneficial Owner to include certain derivative securities relating to the common stock of the Company and increased the purchase price for the rights from $75to $125per share. The Board of Directors may redeem the rights earlier for $001per right. Stock purchase plan.Polaris maintains an employee stock purchase plan Purchase Plan. A total of 3,000,000shares of common stock are reserved for this plan. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock monthly at 95 percentof the average of the beginning and end of month stock prices. As of December31, 2013, approximately 1,241,000shares had been purchased under the Purchase Plan. Dividends. Quarterly and total year cash dividends declared per common share for the year ended December 31, 2013and 2012were as follows:For the Years Ended December 31,20132012Quarterly dividend declared and paid per common share$042$037Total dividends declared and paid per common share$168$148On January30, 2014, the Polaris Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $048per share payable on March17, 2014to holders of record of such shares at the close of business on March3, 2014.Net income per share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period, including shares earned under The Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors Director Plan, the ESOP and deferred stock units under the 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan Omnibus Plan.

As such, a risk exists that Brammo may not be able to secure sufficient financing to reach viability through cash flow from operations. EPPL is a joint venture established in 2012 with Eicher Motors Limited Eicher. Polaris and Eicher each control 50 percentof the joint venture, which is intended to design, develop and manufacture a full range of new vehicles for India and other emerging markets. The investment in EPPL is accounted for under the equity method, with Polaris proportionate share of income or loss recorded within the consolidated financial statements on a onemonth lag due to financial information not being available timely.

At December 31, 2013, Polaris evaluated the investment in Brammo for impairment utilizing level 3 fair value inputs. It was determined that our investment in Brammo was other-than-temporarily impaired due to the specific rights within the series of preferred stock in which Polaris initially invested. As such, Polaris recorded a $5,000,000expense within other income, net in the consolidated statements of income, and reduced the related investment. No other impairments have been recognized on currently held  and Contingencies Product liability: Polaris is subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business. In 2012, Polaris purchased excess insurance coverage for catastrophic product liability claims for incidents occurring after the policy date. Polaris self-insures product liability claims before the policy date and up to the purchased catastrophic insurance coverage after the policy date. The estimated costs resulting from any losses are charged to operating expenses when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably determinable. The Company utilizes historical trends and actuarial analysis tools, along with an analysis of current claims, to assist in determining the appropriate loss reserve levels. At December31, 2013, the Company had an accrual of $17,055,000for the probable payment of pending claims related to continuing operations product liability litigation associated with Polaris products. This accrual is included as a component of other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As previously disclosed, the Company was party to a lawsuit in which the plaintiff was seriously injured in a 2008 accident involving a collision between a 2001 Polaris Virage personal watercraft and a boat. On July 23, 2013, a Los Angeles County jury returned an unfavorable verdict against the Company. The jury returned a verdict finding that the accident was caused by multiple actions, the majority of which was attributed to the negligence of the other boat driver, with the balance attributed to the reckless behavior of the driver of the Virage and the design of the Virage. The jury awarded approximately $21,000,000in damages, of which Polaris' liability was $10,000,000. The Company reported a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $3,777,000for an additional provision to accrue Polaris' portion of the jury award and legal fees. The amount was fully paid in 2013. In September 2004, the Company announced its decision to cease manufacturing marine products. Since then, any material financial results of that division have been recorded in discontinued operations.Litigation: Polaris is a defendant in lawsuits and subject to other claims arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, it is unlikely that any legal proceedings pending against or involving Polaris will have a material adverse effect on Polaris' financial position or results of operations. Contingent purchase price: As a component of certain past acquisition agreements, Polaris has committed to make additional payments to certain sellers contingent upon either the passage of time or certain financial performance criteria. Polaris initially records the fair value of each commitment as of the respective opening balance sheet, and each reporting period the fair value is evaluated, using level 3 inputs, with the change in value reflected in the consolidated statements of income. As of December31, 2013and 2012the fair value of contingent purchase price commitments was $18,249,000and $12,701,000, respectively, recorded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Leases: Polaris leases buildings and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Total rent expense under all operating lease agreements was $10,656,000, $10,349,000, and $9,184,000for 2013, 2012and 2011, respectively. In 2013, Polaris entered into a property lease agreement for a plant in Opole, Poland. Polaris is expected to begin occupying the facility in early 2014, which will commence the lease.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities The Company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations. From time to time, the primary risks managed by using derivative instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price fluctuations. Derivative contracts on various currencies are entered into in order to manage foreign currency exposures associated with certain product sourcing activities and intercompany cash flows. Interest rate swaps are entered into in order to manage interest rate risk associated with the Companys variable-rate borrowings. Commodity hedging contracts are entered into in order to manage fluctuating market prices of certain purchased commodities and raw materials that are integrated into the Companys end products.The Companys foreign currency management objective is to mitigate the potential impact of currency fluctuations on the value of its U.S. dollar cash flows and to reduce the variability of certain cash flows at the subsidiary level. The Company actively manages certain forecasted foreign currency exposures and uses a centralized currency management operation to take advantage of potential opportunities to naturally offset foreign currency exposures against each other. The decision of whether and when to execute derivative instruments, along with the duration of the instrument, can vary from period to period depending on market conditions, the relative costs of the instruments and capacity to hedge. The duration is linked to the timing of the underlying exposure, with the connection between the two being regularly monitored. Polaris does not use any financial contracts for trading purposes. At December31, 2013, Polaris had the following open foreign currency contracts in thousands:Foreign CurrencyNotionalAmountsin US  Dollar$39,744$869Japanese Yen17,864808Mexican Peso28,422162Norwegian Krone1,88521Swedish  contracts, with maturities through December 31, 2014, met the criteria for cash flow hedges and the unrealized gains or losses, after tax, are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity.Polaris enters into derivative contracts to hedge a portion of the exposure related to diesel fuel and aluminum.
