ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
The Board of Directors
Engineering Animation, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of 
Engineering Animation, Inc. as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the related 
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows 
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997. These 
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based 
on our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of Technology 
Company Ventures, L.L.C., which statements reflect total assets and total 
revenues constituting 9% and 19%, respectively, in 1996 of the related 
consolidated totals. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose 
report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to 
data included for Technology Company Ventures, L.L.C., is based solely on the 
report of other auditors.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and report of 
other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of other auditors, 
the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material 
respects, the consolidated financial position of Engineering Animation, Inc. 
at December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the consolidated results of its operations 
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 
31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
in thousands, except share and per share data 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION 
Engineering Animation, Inc. the Company develops, produces and sells 
enterprise-wide visualization and interactive software products that address 
visualization, animation and graphics needs of its customers in domestic and 
international commercial markets.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and 
its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and 
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The consolidated financial statements are presented giving retroactive effect 
to the Company acquisitions of Technology Company Ventures, L.L.C. TCV 
and Cimtech, Inc. Cimtech which have been accounted for under the 
pooling of interests method.
CASH EQUIVALENTS 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three 
months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are 
carried at cost, which approximates market value. 
RESTRICTED CASH
Restricted cash consists of cash committed as collateral for the notes 
payable to the State of Iowa. As requirements of the note are met, the cash 
will be released in increments of $75 on a quarterly basis.
SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
Short-term investments consist of debt securities of the U.S. Government or 
governmental agencies and high-grade commercial paper. Short-term 
investments are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates 
market. The Company classifies its short-term investments as 
available-for-sale. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based 
Compensation but applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 ABP 25 
and related interpretations in accounting for its stock plans. Under APB 25, 
when the exercise price of employee stock option equals the market price of 
the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is 
recognized.
REVENUE RECOGNITION 
Revenue from sales of software products is recognized upon delivery of the 
software product to the customer and satisfaction of significant related 
obligations, if any. Revenue from development, service and customer support 
contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the period the services are 
provided.
Revenue is recognized based upon labor and other costs incurred and progress 
to completion on contracts. Unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue 
earned but not yet billable based on terms of the contract. Billings are made 
based on milestones or as otherwise provided for in the contracts.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant 
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade accounts 
receivable. This risk is partially mitigated due to the large number and 
diversity of entities comprising the Company customer base.
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
The Company international operations represent an increasingly substantial 
portion of its overall operating results. Sales offices are located in 
France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Malaysia.
During 1997, foreign revenues were $5,256 or 11% of total revenues compared 
with $2,505 or 9% of total revenues in 1996 and $599 or 5% of total revenues in
1995.
The Company international operations are subject to a number of risks 
including currency fluctuations, changes in foreign governments and their 
policies, and expropriation or requirements of local or shared ownership. 
The Company believes that the geographic dispersion of its sales and assets 
partially mitigates these risks. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND TRANSACTIONS
The functional currencies of the Company foreign subsidiaries are 
considered to be the respective subsidiary local currency. The effect of 
the cumulative translation adjustment is not material and has not been 
separately disclosed in the Company financial statements.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT 
Property and equipment is carried at cost. Depreciation and amortization of 
property and equipment is provided over the estimated useful lives of the 
assets, which range from three to seven years, on the straight-line method. 
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS 
The Company capitalizes software development costs in accordance with 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86, Accounting for the Costs 
of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed. The 
capitalization of these costs begins when a product technological 
feasibility has been established and ends when the product is available for 
general release to customers. The Company amortizes these costs over an 
estimated economic useful life of three years or on the ratio of current 
revenue to total projected product revenues, whichever is greater. 
Amortization expense was $219, $194 and $121 for the years ended December 31, 
1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. 
INCOME TAXES 
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Under this 
method, deferred income taxes are recognized for future tax consequences 
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts 
of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred 
taxes are recorded based on enacted tax laws and tax rates. Changes in 
enacted tax rates will be reflected in tax provision as they occur.
EARNINGS LOSS PER SHARE 
In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 128, 
Earnings per Share. Statement 128 replaces the calculation of primary and 
fully diluted earnings per share with basic and diluted earnings per share. 
Unlike primary earnings per share, basic earnings per share excludes any 
dilutive effects of options, warrants and convertible securities. Diluted 
earnings per share is very similar to the previously reported fully diluted 
earnings per share. All earnings per share amounts for all periods have been 
presented, and where appropriate, restated to conform to the Statement 128 
requirements. USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying 
notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
2. ACQUISITIONS
In November 1995, TCV was formed for the purpose of acquiring approximately a 
68% interest in Rosetta Technologies, Inc. Rosetta. Since inception, TCV 
has had no other significant activities other than its investment in Rosetta. 
In connection with this transaction, TCV expensed approximately $1,770 of 
acquired in-process research and development and recorded approximately $312 
of goodwill, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over five 
years.
In November 1997, the Company acquired Rosetta in two separate transactions 
valued at approximately $25,500. The Company acquired a controlling interest 
in Rosetta through a merger with TCV in which the Company issued 
approximately 630,000 shares of common stock in exchange for the member 
equity of TCV. Subsequent to the TCV merger, the Company acquired the 
remaining minority interest in Rosetta by issuing approximately 309,000 
shares of common stock in a transaction valued at approximately $7,100. The 
minority interest acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method. 
Approximately $5,600 of the purchase price was allocated to in-process 
research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility 
and had no alternative future use. Accordingly, this amount was charged 
to operations at the date of acquisition and is included in the acquisition 
costs. The in-process research and development was valued using expected 
future cash flows, discounted for risks and uncertainties related to the 
target markets and the completion of the projects. The Company also recorded 
goodwill of $1,039, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 
five years.
In November 1997, the Company also acquired Cimtech in a transaction valued 
at approximately $6,000. The Company issued approximately 185,000 shares of 
common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of Cimtech.
In connection with these November 1997 transactions, the Company also 
recorded approximately $3,200 for transaction costs, employee related expenses 
and other integration costs.
The mergers with TCV and Cimtech were accounted for as pooling of interests. 
Accordingly, the historical financial statements of the Company have been 
restated to include the operating results of TCV and Cimtech for all periods

During 1995, the Company entered into a loan agreement whereby the Company 
agreed to loan approximately $750 to the developer of a building the Company 
leases. During 1996, the Company loaned an additional $658 to the developer. 
The Company began leasing the building July 1996. Interest, at a rate of 
225% above the U. S. Treasury three-year constant rate, began accruing and 
is payable monthly upon commencement of the lease. The principal is due June

at which time the principal and interest accrued to date becomes immediately 
due. The note receivable is collateralized by a second mortgage on the 
building.

Net deferred tax asset liability           $   48   $  897
At December 31, 1997, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of 
$2,300 for federal income tax purposes that expire in the years 2003 through 
2011. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code restricts the annual 
utilization of the NOL incurred prior to a change in ownership. Such a change 
in ownership occurred in connection with TCV acquisition of the majority 
interest of Rosetta in 1995 and with the Company 1997 acquisitions of 
Cimtech and TCV. As a result of the 1995 transaction, the Company is limited 
to using approximately $190 of the net operating loss carryforwards generated 
prior to the 1995 transaction in any one year. The Company does not believe 
that the utilization of the NOL carryforward for the 1997 acquired 
companies will be significantly limited under Section 382.
10. CAPITAL STOCK, STOCK SPLIT AND STOCK OPTIONS 
CAPITAL STOCK
The Company adopted a stockholders rights plan effective at the time of the
initial public offering. Under the plan, each share of common stock has
associated with it one preferred share purchase right Right. The terms of
the Rights are set forth in the Rights Agreement.
STOCK SPLIT
The Board of Directors approved a three-for-two stock split to be affected in 
the form of a stock dividend, payable to shareholders of record as of 
February 12, 1998. Accordingly, all share, per share, weighted average share 
and stock option information has been restated to reflect the split.
STOCK OPTIONS
The Company has stock option arrangements with various officers, directors,
other members of management and employees. The options are generally granted at
fair market value. The options generally vest over periods of five years and
must be exercised no later than 10 years from the date of grant.
In 1994, the Company issued non-qualified options to purchase 532,032 shares of
common stock for $133 per share to two officer/stockholders. These options,
which are not part of the 1994 stock option plan described below, are fully
vested and remain exercisable through June 2009.
During 1994, the Company adopted the Engineering Animation, Inc. 1994 Stock
Option Plan providing for issuance of incentive or non-qualified options to
employees based upon management discretion. During 1997, the Company amended the
plan to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance by 285,000. The
Company has reserved 1,785,000 shares of common stock for issuance under this
plan. 
In February 1995, the Company issued non-plan/non-qualified options to
purchase 221,250 shares of common stock at prices ranging from $267 to $800
per share to five executives. The options are fully vested and remain
exercisable through February 2005. In January 1996, the Company adopted a Non-Employee Directors Option Plan.
During 1997, the Company decreased the number of shares reserved for issuance by
285,000. The Company has reserved 90,000 shares of common stock for issuance
under this Plan. 
During 1997, the Company adopted the Engineering Animation, Inc. 1997 
Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan providing for issuance of non-qualified 
options to employees based upon management discretion. The Company reserved 
600,000 shares of common stock for issuance under this plan.

The weighted-average remaining contractual life of these options is ten years.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required 
by Statement 123, which also requires that the information be determined as 
if the Company has accounted for its employee stock options granted 
subsequent to December 31, 1994 under the fair value method of that 
Statement. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of 
grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following 
weighted-average assumptions for 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively: risk-free interest rates ranging from 57% to 62%; a 
dividend yield of 00%; volatility factors of the expected market price of 
the Company common stock of 34, 40 and 01, and a weighted-average 
expected life of the option of four years.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because
the Company employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options
is amortized to expense net of related pro forma tax benefits over the options'
vesting period. The Company pro forma information follows                      1997     1996     1995
Pro forma net income loss      $ 2,666   $ 2,270   $ 1,920
Pro forma earnings loss per share:
Basic               $  030   $ 031   $  040
Diluted              $  030   $ 026   $  040 Because Statement 123 is applicable only to options granted subsequent to
December 31, 1994, its pro forma effect is not representative of future pro
forma amounts.
11. EARNINGS PER SHARE

12. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLAN 
The Company has a 401k plan which covers substantially all employees who meet
the minimum age requirement. The Company is required to match one-half of the
employee contribution up to a maximum Company contribution of the first 4% of
the employee compensation. Plan expense for 1997, 1996 and 1995 was
approximately $211, $130 and $58 respectively.
13. FAIR MARKET VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its
fair value disclosures for financial instruments NOTES RECEIVABLE--the carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for the note
receivable approximates its fair value as it carries a floating rate of
interest.
LONG-TERM DEBT--the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for the
Company bank notes payable approximate their fair values as they bear variable
rates of interest. The Company believes that the municipal notes, issued to the
Company to encourage and facilitate expansion and increased employment,
approximate their fair values as they were negotiated and issued in the latter
half of 1997. The prime lending rate in 1997 approximated the rate in 1996 and,
accordingly, the fair value change would be immaterial.
14. MAJOR CUSTOMERS
One major customer accounted for 19% of revenues for 1997. Two major customers
accounted for 26% of revenues in 1996. One major customer accounted for 10% of
revenues for 1995. 
15. QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UNAUDITED
