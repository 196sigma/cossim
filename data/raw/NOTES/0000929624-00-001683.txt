The Board of Directors
Netopia, Inc. and subsidiaries  We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Netopia, Inc. and
subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index. In connection with our audits
of the consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the financial
statement schedule as listed in the accompanying index. These consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Netopia,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2000 and 1999 and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended September 30, 2000 in conformity with auditing principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth herein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Business
Netopia the Company provides Internet and electronic commerce
infrastructure that enables small and medium size businesses to connect to the
Internet, establish and enhance their presence, and conduct business and
electronic commerce on the Web. The Company offers high-speed, multi-user,
plug-and-play Internet equipment products and Web platforms for creating and
hosting Web sites, creating and hosting electronic commerce stores, and
conducting real-time Internet communications.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries located in France, Germany,
Australia, and the Netherlands. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments
Cash equivalents consist of instruments with purchased maturities of 90 days
or less. Certain cash equivalents and all of the Company investments are
classified as available-for-sale. The securities are carried at fair value,
which approximates cost.
The amortized cost of available-for-sale debt securities is adjusted for
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such
amortization is included in other income, net. Realized gains and losses, and
declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available-for-sale
securities are included in other income, net. The cost of securities sold is
based on the specific identification method. Interest and dividends on
securities classified as available-for-sale are included in other income, net.
Cash equivalents and short-term investments classified as available-for-sale
as of September 30, 2000 and 1999, consisted of the following in thousands                                September 30,
2000  1999
U.S. Treasury Securities and obligations of U.S.
Government  $  -- $  996
Money market    478     Corporate  22,370  3,015
Commercial  36,713 49,822
$59,561 $53,833
The available-for-sale securities as of September 30, 2000 and 1999 were all
due in one year or less. As of September 30, 2000, the Company had an
unrealized loss on short-term investments of approximately $506,000. Expected
maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers of the
securities may have the right to prepay obligations without penalties.
Revenue Recognition
The Company revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Statement
of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended. In general,
software license revenues are recognized when a non-cancelable license
agreement has been signed and the customer acknowledges an unconditional
obligation to
52             NETOPIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
pay, the software product has been delivered, there are no uncertainties
surrounding product acceptance, the fees are fixed and determinable, and
collection is considered probable; professional services revenues are
recognized as such services are performed; and maintenance revenues, including
revenues bundled with software agreements which entitle the customers to
technical support and future unspecified enhancements to the Company
products, are deferred and recognized ratably over the related contract period,
generally twelve months. Revenues recognized from multiple-element software
arrangements are allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair
values of the elements, such as software products, upgrades, enhancements, post
contract customer support, installation, or training. The determination of fair
value is based on objective evidence which is specific to the Company.
The Company records unearned revenue for software arrangements when cash has
been received from the customer and the arrangement does not qualify for
revenue recognition under the Company revenue recognition policy. The Company
records accounts receivable for software arrangements when the arrangement
qualifies for revenue recognition and cash or other consideration has not been
received from the customer.
In December 1998, AcSEC issued SOP 98-9, Software Revenue Recognition, With
Respect to Certain Transactions, which requires recognition of revenue using
the residual method in a multiple-element arrangement when fair value does
not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement. Under
the residual method, the total fair value of the undelivered elements is
deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with SOP 97-2. There was no
material change to the Company accounting for revenues as a result of the
provisions of SOP 98-9.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations
of credit risk principally consist of cash, cash equivalents, short-term
investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
The Company limits the amounts invested in any one type of investment. The
Company maintains its cash investments with two financial institutions.
Management believes the financial risks associated with such deposits are
minimal.
The Company sells its products primarily through distributors and resellers.
Sales are generally not collateralized, credit evaluations are performed as
appropriate, and allowances are provided for estimated credit losses.
Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on trade
receivables from any particular customer, industry, or geographic region.
However, during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2000, the Company fully reserved
$19 million of outstanding accounts receivable owed by one Competitive Local
Exchange CLEC customer.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by
the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment
Furniture, fixtures, and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the
shorter of estimated useful lives or related lease terms ranging from one to
seven years.
53             NETOPIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Including Identifiable Intangibles
The Company evaluates long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets
to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an
asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such
assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of
the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying
values or fair values, less costs of disposal.
Intangible assets consists of developed and core technology, assembled
workforce and a non-compete agreement related to the Company acquisitions of
WebOrder, StarNet, Serus and netOctopus. Goodwill is amortized over a four year
period. Intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful life
of approximately three years.
Software Development Costs
Research and development costs include costs related to software products
that are expensed as incurred until the technological feasibility of the
product has been established. The Company has defined technological feasibility
as completion of a working model. After technological feasibility is
established, any additional software development costs are capitalized in
accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to
Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. Product development costs capitalized
are amortized over a future period.
Amortization of capitalized product development costs begins when the
products are available for general release to customers, and is computed on a
product-by-product basis as the greater of: i the ratio of current gross
revenue for a product to the total of current and anticipated future gross
revenues for the product; or ii the straight-line method over the remaining
estimated economic life of the product, which is generally two years. All other
research and development expenditures are charged to research and development
expense in the period incurred. During fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, $679,000 656,000 and $237,000, respectively, of product development cost incurred
subsequent to delivery of a working model, under a development agreement with a
third party, have been capitalized.
Advertising Costs
The Company records advertising costs in accordance with SOP 93-7, Reporting
On Advertising Costs. SOP 93-7 permits the capitalization and amortization of
direct response advertising costs when persuasive historical evidence exists
that allows the entity to reliably predict future net revenues that will be
obtained as a result of the advertising. Advertising expense was $707,000, $17
million and $13 million for fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. For the
fiscal years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, the Company did not
capitalize advertising costs.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years that those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to
the extent such deferred tax assets may not be realized.
54             NETOPIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Investments
The Company accounts for investments in equity securities in accordance with
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Marketable
securities are composed primarily of equity securities. The Company has equity
securities in one publicly traded Company and in two privately held companies.
The Company classifies all of its equity securities as available-for-sale.
These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and
losses, net of income taxes, reported as a component of comprehensive income
loss.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has elected to continue to use the intrinsic value-based method
as allowed under Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, to account for all of its stock-based employee
compensation plans. Pursuant to SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, the Company is required to disclose the pro forma effects on
operating results as if the Company had elected to use the fair value approach
to account for all its stock-based employee compensation plans.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and the recorded amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Per Share Calculations
Basic net loss per share EPS is based on the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per
share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period and dilutive common equivalent shares from
options and warrants outstanding during the period. No common equivalent shares
are included for loss periods as they would be anti-dilutive. Dilutive common
equivalent shares consist of options and warrants.
Potentially dilutive common shares have been excluded from the computation
of diluted EPS for fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998 since their effect on EPS is
antidilutive due to the losses incurred in each period. Potentially dilutive
common shares which were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS consisted
of options to purchase common stock totaling 4,019,480 in fiscal 2000;
4,040,520 in fiscal 1999; 3,520,899 in fiscal 1998, and warrants to purchase
common stock totaling 60,000 in each of fiscal 1999 and 1998.
Comprehensive Income Loss
The Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income in April
1999. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for the reporting and disclosure of
comprehensive income loss and its components. Comprehensive income loss
includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from

applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition issues
in financial statements. The Company will adopt SAB 101 in fiscal 2001 and the
Company is evaluating the effect, if any, that such adoption may have on its
consolidated results of operations and financial position.
In March 2000, the FASB issued Interpretation FIN No44, Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation--an Interpretation of
Accounting Principles Board APB No. 25. APB No. 25 clarifies a the definition
of employee for purposes of applying APB No. 25; b the criteria for

fixed stock option or award; and d the accounting for an exchange of stock
compensation awards in a business compensation. The Company adopted FIN No. 44
on July 1, 2000 which did not have a material effect on the Company
consolidated results of operations and financial position.
2 Acquisitions
WebOrder
On March 23, 2000, the Company acquired all the outstanding common and
preferred stock of WebOrder, a California corporation, in a merger transaction
in which WebOrder merged into WO Merger Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary
formed in connection with the transaction. WebOrder was a developer of e-
commerce infrastructure for small and medium size businesses. WebOrder Smart
Commerce System offers e-commerce solutions to on-line businesses including the
ability to manage order processing, and the ability to maintain records of
customer transactions flowing through a merchant e-store.
The Company accounted for the transaction under the purchase method. The
aggregate purchase price of the transaction was approximately $207 million,
based on the consideration paid at closing. The final purchase price is
dependent on potential earnout payments as discussed below. The aggregate
purchase price includes. $16 million in cash paid on the closing date of the transaction. 233,119 shares of our common stock issued on the closing date. A series of potential earnout payments paid in cash and common stock
after the closing date if certain revenue milestones are achieved. These
earnout opportunities will be added to and included in the purchase price
for accounting purposes when the earnouts have been achieved and
additional consideration is distributable. At September 30, 2000, no
milestones had been achieved. The substitution of stock options to purchase the Company common stock
in replacement of the WebOrder options held by WebOrder former
employees, who joined Netopia after the closing, valued at approximately
$21 million. The Company used the Black-Scholes method to value the
options issued using the following assumptions: volatility of 101   expected life of 5 years, interest rate of 57%, and no dividends; and. Transaction costs of approximately $975,000 which includes legal fees,
accounting fees, and fees for other related professional services.
56             NETOPIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Approximately 15,695 shares of the Company common stock will be held in
escrow for one year after the closing to satisfy WebOrder indemnification
obligations.
The excess purchase price over the net book value of the assets acquired was
approximately $201 million. The transaction resulted in goodwill and other
intangible assets of approximately $171 million, which is being amortized over
four and three years, respectively and a charge for acquired in-process
research and development of approximately $30 million. During the fiscal year
ended September 30, 2000, the Company amortized $24 million in goodwill and
other intangible assets related to the acquisition of WebOrder.
Both cost and income approaches were used to appraise the value of the
business and projects acquired. Such methods take into consideration
replacement costs of assets acquired, the stage of completion of the projects
and estimates related to expected future revenues, expenses and cash flows
which are then discounted back to present day amounts. Based upon these
estimates, material net cash flows from the acquired business are expected to
occur during the Company first quarter of 2001. These cash flows were
discounted using a weighted average discount rate of 42%. Based upon the
expenses incurred and the development time invested in the products prior to
the acquisition and the estimated expenses and development time to complete the
products, the Company determined the products purchased in aggregate, including
products under development and completed products, to be approximately 82%
complete at the time of acquisition. The Company completed the in-process
research and development during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2000 and expended
approximately $326,000 to complete the in-process research and development.
All of WebOrder former full time employees became employees of Netopia.
WebOrder founder and one other key shareholder/employee entered into non-
competition agreements in connection with the acquisition.
StarNet Technologies
On October 13, 1999, the Company acquired StarNet Technologies, Inc.,
StarNet, a California corporation, in a merger transaction in which StarNet
merged into a wholly owned subsidiary. StarNet had been developing a voice
channel technology architecture that allows the transmission of voice lines
over a digital subscriber line along with the simultaneous transmission of
standard data packets.
The Company accounted for the transaction under the purchase method. The
aggregate consideration constituting the purchase price was approximately $275
million at closing and may increase by up to an additional $49 million
depending on potential earnout payments. The aggregate consideration included. $84 million in cash paid on the closing date of the transaction. 447,852 shares of our common stock issued on the closing date. A series of potential cash earnout payments aggregating up to
approximately $59 million at various times after the closing date if
certain technical and revenue milestones are achieved. These earnout
opportunities will be included in the purchase price for accounting
purposes when the milestones are achieved and additional consideration is
distributable. At the acquisition date, we had deemed probable and
recorded approximately $10 million in earnout payments. During the three
months ended June 30, 2000, the Company determined that the milestones
for the $10 million potential earnout payment would not be met and
accordingly, reduced the purchase price and amortization of goodwill
relating to the purchase of StarNet by such amount. As of September 30,
2000, no earnouts have been achieved.
57             NETOPIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued. The substitution of stock options to purchase the Company common stock
in replacement of the StarNet options held by StarNet former employee,
who joined Netopia after the closing, valued at approximately $14
million. The Company used the Black-Scholes method to value the options
issued using the following assumptions: volatility of 101%, expected life
of 4 years, interest rate of 49%; and no dividends; and. Transaction costs of approximately $820,000 which includes legal fees,
accounting fees, fees paid for an independent fairness opinion, and fees
for other services.
Approximately 30,673 shares of common stock were held in escrow for a period
of time after the closing to satisfy StarNet indemnification obligations
under the definitive acquisition agreements. During the three months ended June
30, 2000, a portion of these shares were released from the escrow to Netopia to
satisfy Netopia indemnification claims, and the remaining shares were
released from escrow to StarNet former shareholders.
The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and resulted in
goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately $224 million at closing
which is being amortized over four and three years, respectively, and a charge
for acquired in-process research and development of $57 million. During the
fiscal year ended September 30, 2000, the Company amortized $66 million in
goodwill and other intangible assets related to the purchase of StarNet.
The Company used the income approach to appraise the value of the business
and projects acquired. Such method takes into consideration the stage of
completion of the projects and estimates related to expected future revenues,
expenses and cash flows which are then discounted back to present day amounts.
Based upon these estimates, material net cash flows from the acquired business
were expected to occur during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2000. These cash
flows were discounted using a weighted average discount rate of 20%. Based upon
the expenses incurred and the development time invested in the products prior
to the acquisition and the estimated expenses and development time to complete
the products, the Company determined the products purchased in aggregate,
including products under development and completed products, to be
approximately 73% complete at the time of acquisition. The Company expects to
complete the in-process research and development in the second fiscal quarter
of 2001 and the Company estimates the cost to complete the in-process research
and development to be approximately $287,000.
All of StarNet former full time employees became employees of Netopia.
Each of StarNet founders, and certain other key employees, entered into non-
competition agreements in connection with the acquisition.

dependent on potential earnout payments. The aggregate purchase price includes. $11 million in cash paid on the closing date of the transaction; and. A series of potential earnout payments totaling $300,000 if certain
revenue and technical milestones are achieved. These earnout
opportunities will be added to and included in the purchase price for
accounting purposes when the milestones have achieved and additional
consideration is distributable. In our first fiscal quarter of 2000, we
made a $100,000 earnout payment which we recorded as part of the purchase
price of the transaction.
The excess purchase price over the net book value acquired was $11 million,
of which, based upon the Company estimates prepared in conjunction with a
third party valuation consultant, $400,000 was allocated to acquired in-process
research and development and $753,000 was allocated to intangible assets. The
amounts allocated to intangible assets include assembled workforces of $60,000,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued 3 Discontinued Operations
On August 5, 1998, the Company sold its Farallon Local Area Networking LAN
Division the LAN Division including the LAN Division products, accounts
receivable, inventory, property and equipment, intellectual property and other
related assets to Farallon Communications, Inc. Farallon, formerly known as
Farallon Networking Corporation, a Delaware corporation and an affiliate of
Gores Technology Group Gores. The consideration the Company received for the
sale of the LAN Division consisted of the following in thousands                                    
$2,000
Note   888
Royalties  1,782
189
$4,859
The note receivable was for $10 million which was payable on July 31, 2000,
bearing interest at 8% per annum. Farallon paid the note and related interest
receivable in its entirety on May 9, 2000.
The royalties receivable were based upon Farallon total annual revenues
over each of the next five fiscal years ending on July 31, 2003. If total
annual revenues of at least $150 million are reached, the royalty rate applies
to total revenues, including the first $150 million.
The value of the royalties accrued at the close of the transaction was based
upon the present value of the Company assumptions as to the projected future
revenue of the LAN Division. Royalties accrued; however, were not recorded to
the extent that total consideration on the transaction exceeded the net asset
value of the LAN Division assets being sold.
Additionally, the Company received and valued a warrant to purchase up to 5%
of the equity of Farallon as of the closing of the transaction. Subsequently,
the Company entered into an agreement with the buyer to reduce the warrant
entitlement to 3% of the equity of Farallon.
The disposition of the LAN Division in August 1998 has been accounted for as
a discontinued operation in accordance with APB Opinion No. 30, and prior
period consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the LAN
Division operations as a discontinued operation. Revenue from discontinued
operations was $151 million and $320 million in fiscal 1998 and 1997,
respectively. The income from discontinued operations of $602,000 in fiscal
1998 and represents operating income, net of taxes, of the discontinued
operation. The loss on sale of discontinued operations of $31 million in
fiscal 1998 is principally comprised of the transaction expenses and costs
incurred and accrued as a result of the sale of the LAN Division. Such expenses
are directly attributable to the sale transaction and are primarily related to
reserves taken against the lease of the Company Alameda, California
headquarters, investment advisory, legal and accounting fees and certain
expenses related to employees of the LAN Division. Of the amount recorded as a
loss on the sale of discontinued operations, $12 million is included in
accrued liabilities at September 30, 1999.
During the fiscal third quarter of 2000, Farallon bought out its royalty
obligation in its entirety for an amount in excess of the receivable on the
Company balance sheet. In addition, the Company exercised our warrant in
Farallon and sold the shares received upon exercise of the warrant. These
transactions resulted in income of $13 million, net of taxes, and are included
in the gain on sale from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2000. In addition, the gain on sale from discontinued operations
also represents the reversal of a liability recorded for the excess space
created at the Company Alameda, California headquarters that the Company
believed could not be subleased to third parties at the time of sale. During
the three months ended December 31, 1999, the Company found alternative uses
for this excess space.

respectively.
At September 30, 2000 and 1999, the Company believed that based upon
available objective evidence, there was sufficient uncertainty regarding the
realizability of its deferred tax assets to warrant a full valuation allowance.
The factors considered included the relative shorter life cycles in the high
technology industry and the uncertainty of longer-term taxable income
estimates. Included in the valuation allowance is a tax benefit attributable to
noncompensatory stock options of $74 million of tax benefit attributable to
purchase acquisitions which, when realized, will be a credit to additional
paid-in-capital.
At September 30, 2000, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $301 million for federal tax purposes and $161 million for
state tax purposes. If not earlier utilized, the federal net operating loss
carryforwards will expire in various years beginning in 2019 through 2020 and

of approximately $149,000 for federal tax purposes and $169,000 for state tax
purposes. These credits carryforward indefinitely until utilized.
Federal and California state tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the
utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in the event of an ownership
change for tax purposes, as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code. If such ownership change were to occur, utilization of net operating
losses would be subject to annual limitations in future years.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Included in the 1996 Plan is a provision for the automatic grant of non-
statutory options to non-employee Board of Director members of 25,000 shares on
the effective date of the Company initial public offering at the initial
offering price. These options were granted to two non-employee Board of
Director members, of which one currently remains on the Company Board of
Directors. Thereafter, each new director will be granted an option to purchase
25,000 shares of common stock on the date they become a Board member of the
Company at the then current fair market value. Options issued to Board members
after January 13, 2000 will become exercisable in four successive and equal
annual installments over the non-employee Board member period of continued
service as a Board member, beginning one year from the grant date of the
option.
The Board of Directors, on July 24, 1996, unanimously amended the Notice of
Grant to provide for a four year vesting schedule commencing on the date of the
grant. Grants prior to that date normally vest over five years commencing on
the date of the grant.
In the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company provided a 90 day extension
of the exercise period for all Farallon employees with outstanding stock
options priced at $400 or higher in the Company. This resulted in a total
compensation charge of approximately $35,000. In the fourth quarter of fiscal
1998, in connection with the sale of Farallon, the Company provided for an
accelerated vesting period to discretionary employees of Farallon for their
outstanding stock options in the Company. This resulted in a total compensation
charge of approximately $143,500 in fiscal 1998.

1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
On April 16, 1996, the Board adopted the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
the Purchase Plan and reserved 300,000 shares of common stock for issuance
under the Purchase Plan. To date an additional 500,000 shares have been
approved for issuance under the Purchase Plan. Employees may purchase shares of
common stock at a price per share that is 85% of the lesser of the fair market
value as of the beginning or the end of the semi-annual option period.
Shares issued under the Purchase Plan totaled 130,306 in fiscal 2000,
199,721 in fiscal 1999, 153,157 in fiscal 1998 and 178,236 in fiscal 1997. As
of September 30, 2000, 661,420 shares have been issued under the Purchase Plan
and 138,580 shares were reserved for future issuances under the plan.
Pro Forma Disclosure--Compensatory Stock Arrangements
Stock options are granted at not less than the fair market value of the
common stock on the date of grant. All options expire no later than 10 years
from the date of grant. The Company has adopted the disclosure provisions of
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, which was issued in
October 1995. As permitted by the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company
applies APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its stock
option plans.
If the Company had elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair
value of the options granted at grant date and the fair value of shares
purchased under the plan as prescribed by SFAS No. 123, net loss and per share
results would have been the pro forma amounts indicated in the table below in
thousands, except per share amounts                            September 30,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  The effect on net loss and net loss per share is not expected to be
indicative of the effects on results in future years.
The effect of applying SFAS No. 123 for disclosing compensation costs may
not be representative of the effects on reported net loss for the future years
because pro forma net loss reflects compensation costs only for stock options
granted in fiscal 2000, 1999, 1998 and 1997. The weighted average fair value of
employee stock options granted during fiscal 2000, 1999, 1998 and 1997 was
$3122, $808, $348 and $305 respectively.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable while the Company employee stock options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options. In
addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. The fair value of
each option grant and share purchased under the Purchase Plan are estimated on
the date of grant or share purchase using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with the following assumptions                                 Years ended

9 Geographic, Segment and Significant Customer Information
The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 131, Disclosure about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, during fiscal year 1999.
SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for the reporting by public business
enterprises of information about operating segments, products and services,
geographic areas, and major customers. The methodology for determining what
information is reported is based on the organization of operating segments and
the related information that the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM uses for
operational decisions and financial performance assessments. The Company
Chief Executive Officer CEO is considered its CODM. For purposes of making
operating decisions and assessing financial performance, the CEO reviews
financial information presented on a consolidated basis accompanied by
disaggregated information for revenues and gross margins by product group as
well as revenues by geographic region and by customer. Currently, operating
expenses or assets are not disaggregated by product group for purposes of
making operating decisions and assessing performance.
