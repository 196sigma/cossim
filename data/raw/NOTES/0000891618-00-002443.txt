SECTION 16A BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE.

securities, to file reports of ownership on Form 3 and changes in ownership on
Form 4 or Form 5 with the Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC and the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Such officers, directors and
10% shareholders are also required by SEC rules to furnish 3dfx with copies of

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS
Members of 3dfx board of directors do not receive compensation for their
services as directors. 3dfx 1997 Director Option Plan provides that options
shall be granted to non-employee directors of 3dfx pursuant to an automatic
nondiscretionary grant mechanism. The exercise price of the options is 100% of
the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. The Director Plan
provides for an initial grant of options to purchase 12,500 shares of common
stock to each new non-employee director of 3dfx who is neither affiliated with
nor nominated by a shareholder that owns 1% or more of the outstanding capital
stock of 3dfx on the later of the effective date of the Director Plan or the
date he first becomes a director. In addition, each non-employee director will
automatically be granted an additional option to purchase 5,000 shares of common
stock at the next meeting of the board of directors following the annual
43
44
meeting of shareholders if on such date, such director has served on the board
of directors for at least six months; provided, however, if such director is
elected as Chairman of the Board of Directors, such option grant shall be 10,000
shares. In addition to these grants, each director shall automatically be
granted an option to purchase 1,000 shares at the next meeting of the board of
directors following the annual meeting of shareholders if such director serves
on either the Audit Committee or Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors. If such director serves on both such Committees, this grant shall be
2,000 shares. The options granted to the directors have different vesting
periods: 12,500 share options granted to a director vest at a rate of 1/48th of
the shares subject to the option per month following the date of grant; 5,000 or
10,000 share options granted to a director vest at a rate of 1/12th of the
shares subject to the option per month following the date of grant; and 1,000
share options granted to a director vest at a rate of 1/12th of the shares
subject to the option per month following the date of grant.
