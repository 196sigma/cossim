Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15f or 15d-15f promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.  Management has
designed its internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Managements assessment included review and testing of both the design effectiveness and operating effectiveness of controls over all relevant assertions related to all significant accounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.  All internal control systems, no matter
how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our principal executive officers and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of December 31, 2004.  BDO Seidman, LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, audited managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and issued the report set forth on page 24.

year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test

operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Dril-Quip,
Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of Treadway Commission COSO and our

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  The Board of Directors and Stockholders Dril-Quip, Inc.:  We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that
Dril-Quip, Inc. the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Dril-Quip, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  In our opinion, managements assessment that Dril-Quip, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO
criteria. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2004 and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended and our report dated March 11, 2005 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.  BDO Seidman,
LLP  Houston, Texas March 11, 2005

DRIL-QUIP, INC.  
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  December 31, 2004  1.Organization
Dril-Quip, Inc., a Delaware corporation the
Company or Dril-Quip, manufactures highly engineered offshore drilling and production equipment which is well suited for use in deepwater, harsh environment and severe service applications. The Companys principal
products consist of subsea and surface wellheads, subsea and surface production trees, mudline hanger systems, specialty connectors and associated pipe, drilling and production riser systems, wellhead connectors and diverters for use by major
integrated, large independent and foreign national oil and gas companies in offshore areas throughout the world. Dril-Quip also provides installation and reconditioning services and rents running tools for use in connection with the installation and
retrieval of its products.  The Companys operations are
organized into three geographic segmentsWestern Hemisphere including North and South America; headquartered in Houston, Texas, Eastern Hemisphere including Europe and Africa; headquartered in Aberdeen, Scotland and Asia-Pacific including
the Pacific Rim, Southeast Asia, Australia, India and the Middle East; headquartered in Singapore. Each of these segments sells similar products and services and the Company has major manufacturing facilities in all three of its headquarter
locations. The Companys major subsidiaries are Dril-Quip Europe Limited DQE, located in Aberdeen with branches in Denmark, Norway and Holland, Dril-Quip Asia Pacific PTE Ltd. DQAP, located in Singapore, and Dril-Quip do Brasil LTDA,
located in Macae, Brazil. Dril-Quip Nigeria Ltd. is located in Port Harcourt, Nigeria and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DQE.  2.Significant Accounting Policies  Principles of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the
financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of the Companys more significant estimates are those affected by critical accounting
policies for revenue recognition, inventories and contingent liabilities.  Cash and cash equivalents  Short-term investments that have a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.  Inventories  Inventory costs are determined principally by the use of the first-in, first-out FIFO method, and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory
is valued principally using standard costs that are calculated based upon direct costs incurred and overhead allocations. Periodically, obsolescence reviews are performed on slow moving inventories and reserves are established based upon current
assessments about future demands and market conditions. The inventory values have been reduced by a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories. Inventory reserves of $83 million and $99 million were recorded as of December 31, 2003 and 2004,
respectively. If market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory reserves may be required. 
30 Table of Contents DRIL-QUIP, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  December 31, 2004 
Property, Plant, and Equipment  Property, plant, and equipment are carried at cost, with depreciation provided on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful lives.  Income Taxes  The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Deferred
income taxes are provided on income and expenses which are reported in different periods for income tax and financial reporting purposes.  Revenue Recognition  The Company delivers most of its products on an as-needed basis by its customers and records revenues as the products are shipped. Service revenues are
recorded at the time the service is rendered. Allowances for doubtful accounts are determined generally on a case by case basis and historically have been insignificant. Certain revenues are derived from long-term contracts which generally require
more than one year to fulfill. Revenues and profits on long-term contracts are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method based on a cost-incurred basis. Losses, if any, on contracts are recognized when they become known. Contracts for
long-term projects contain provisions for customer progress payments. Payments in excess of revenues recognized are included as a customer prepayment liability. At December 31, 2003 and 2004, trade receivables included $1,685,000 and $6,020,000
respectively, in unbilled revenue, and inventories had been reduced by $2,978,000 and $6,514,000, respectively, for activities relating to long-term contracts. 
Foreign Currency  The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates except for revenues and expenses, which are
translated at average rates during each reporting period. Translation adjustments are reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity and have no current effect on earnings or cash flows. These adjustments amounted to gains of
$3,722,000, $5,386,000 and $4,091,000 in 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively.  Foreign currency exchange transactions are recorded using the exchange rate at the date of the settlement. Exchange gains losses were approximately $425,000 in 2002, $365,000 in 2003, and $636,000 in 2004, net of
income taxes. These amounts are included in selling, general, and administrative costs in the consolidated statements of income.  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting For Stock Based
Compensation SFAS No. 123. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for stock options granted under the Companys incentive plan. 
31 Table of Contents DRIL-QUIP, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  December 31, 2004 
Under SFAS No. 123, pro forma information is required to reflect the estimated effect on net income
and earnings per share as if the Company had accounted for the stock options using the fair value method. The fair value was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:  2002 2003 2004
Risk free interest rate 425 311 No grants
Volatility of the stock price 649 620 Expected life of options in years 5 5 Expected dividend 00 00 Calculated fair value per share 1195 822  Had compensation cost
for the Companys stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under the above plan consistent with the method available under SFAS No. 123, the Companys net income and earnings per
share for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts listed below. There were no options granted in 2004.  Year ended December 31 2002 2003 2004 Net Income As reported 8,723 8,951 12,473 Less: Compensation expense per SFAS No. 123, net of tax 1,939 2,248 2,148 Pro forma net income 6,784 6,703 10,325 Earnings per share Basic 050 052 072 Diluted 050 052 072 Pro forma Basic 039 039 060 Diluted 039 039 059  Fair Value of
Financial Instruments  The Companys financial
instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables, and debt instruments. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their respective fair values as they are either short-term in nature or carry
interest rates that approximate market rates.  Concentration
of Credit Risk  Financial instruments which subject the
Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade receivables. The Company grants credit to its customers, which operate primarily in the oil and gas industry. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its
customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains reserves for potential losses, and such losses have historically been within managements expectations.  Comprehensive Income  SFAS No. 130 establishes the rules for the reporting and display of
comprehensive income and its components. SFAS No. 130 requires the Company to include unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency translation adjustments in comprehensive income. Generally, gains are attributed to a weakening U.S. dollar and
losses are the result of a strengthening U.S. dollar. 
32 Table of Contents DRIL-QUIP, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  December 31, 2004 
Interest Capitalization  The Company capitalizes interest on significant construction projects for which interest costs are being incurred. These
projects principally consist of construction or expansion of the Companys facilities. The Company capitalized approximately $10,000 in 2002 and no interest was capitalized in 2003 or 2004.  Earnings Per Share  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed considering the dilutive effect of stock options using the treasury stock method.  New Accounting Standards  In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the
Act was signed into law. The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad. The Act further provides for a tax deduction for qualified production activities. Under the guidance of
FASB Staff Position No. 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the deduction will
be treated as a special deduction as described in SFAS 109 and not as a reduction in the tax rate. As such, the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing on the date of enactment. Rather, the impact
of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our tax return. We are still reviewing whether any of our operations would qualify for this deduction.  Also in December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 109-2,
Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. We do not expect the adoption of these new tax provisions to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  In
November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 151, Inventory Costs SFAS 151. SFAS 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2005. The Company believes that there will be no material effect on its financial statements upon adoption of this statement.  In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payments. This statement is a
revision of SFAS Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123R addresses all forms of
share based payment SBP awards including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. Under SFAS No. 123R, SBP awards result in a cost that will be measured at fair
value on the awards grant date, based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest and will be reflected as compensation expense in the financial statements. In addition, this statement will apply to unvested options granted
prior to the effective date. This new standard is effective in interim and annual reporting periods that begin after June 15, 2005. Dril-Quip, Inc. is currently evaluating the effect that implementation of the new standard will have on its financial
position, results of operations, and cash flows.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The UK deferred tax valuation allowance was $261,000 and $325,000 in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Significant components of the
Companys deferred tax liabilities and assets are as follows:  December 31 2003 2004 Deferred tax assets Deferred profit on intercompany sales 1,868 1,872 Inventory 1,400 2,555 Inventory reserve 455 Provision for doubtful accounts 9 926 Other 1,828 1,684 Total deferred tax assets 5,105 7,492 Deferred tax liability Property, plant and equipment 4,751 6,769 Valuation allowance 325 261 Net deferred tax asset 29 462  Undistributed earnings
of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal income taxes has been provided thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or
otherwise, the Company may be subject to both U.S. income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax
liability is not practicable.  The Companys income tax
returns are subject to review and examination by the Internal Revenue Service IRS and in August 2004, the IRS scheduled an examination of the 2002 Tax Return. We believe the return is materially correct as filed and we do
not expect that the examination will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or financial position.  On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act was signed into law. The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S.
corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing, in some cases, an 85 percent dividends received deduction for dividends paid by certain non-U.S. subsidiaries of the U.S. corporation controlled foreign
corporations to the U.S. corporation. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations and uncertainty currently remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions of the Act. Further, several requirements must be met in order to qualify
for the deduction. While we are still in the process of analyzing whether the Company could qualify for the deduction, it is possible that under the repatriation provisions of the Act certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries may repatriate to the
Company some amount of earnings. We have not provided for deferred U.S. taxes on the unremitted earnings for the Companys controlled foreign corporations and with this deduction, should we qualify, the impact on the Companys tax expense
for possible repatriation of accumulated income earned abroad would not be material.  The Act further provides for a tax deduction for qualified production activities. Under the guidance of FASB Staff Position No. 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes,
to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in SFAS 109 and not as a reduction in the tax rate. As such,
the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing on the date of enactment. Rather, the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our tax return. We are still
reviewing whether any of our operations would qualify for this deduction.

The Company paid approximately $1,110,000, $3,954,000 and $2,257,000 in income taxes in 2002, 2003
and 2004, respectively.  7.Employee Benefit Plans
The Company has a defined-contribution 401k plan
covering domestic employees and a defined-contribution pension plan covering certain foreign employees. The Company generally makes contributions to the plans equal to each participants eligible contributions for the plan year up to a
specified percentage of the participants annual compensation. The Companys contribution expense was $981,000, $902,000 and $958,000 in 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively.  8.Commitments and Contingencies  The Company leases certain office, shop and warehouse facilities, automobiles, and equipment. The Company expenses all lease
payments when incurred. Total lease expense incurred was $2,055,000, $2,004,000 and $2,062,000 in 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. Annual minimum lease commitments at December 31, 2004 are as follows: 2005$1,702,000; 2006$758,000;
2007$444,000; 2008$128,000; 2009$109,000; and thereafter$2,399,000.  The Company operates its business and markets its products and services in most of the significant oil and gas producing areas in the world and is, therefore, subject to the risk customarily attendant to international
operations and dependency on the condition of the oil and gas industry. Additionally, products of the Company are used in potentially hazardous drilling, completion, and production applications that can cause personal injury, product liability, and
environmental claims. Although exposure to such risk has not resulted in any significant problems in the past, there can be no assurance that future developments will not adversely impact the Company.  The Company is involved in a number of legal actions arising in the ordinary
course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect the consolidated financial statements of the Company, although no assurance can be given with respect to the
ultimate outcome of this litigation.  During the fourth quarter
of 2002 the Company established a $135 million reserve for warranty claims related to the Companys drilling riser product. This reserve was increased by $14 million in the second quarter of 2003 to reflect the cost of settling these warranty
claims. As a result of this settlement, all outstanding warranty issues related to this product have been resolved.  9.Stockholders Equity  Under a Stockholder Rights Plan adopted by the Board of Directors in 1997, each share of common stock includes one Right to purchase from the Company a
unit consisting of one one-hundredth of a share a Fractional Share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a specified purchase price per Fractional Share, subject to adjustment in certain events. The Rights will cause
substantial dilution to any person or group that attempts to acquire the Company without the approval of the Companys Board of Directors.

Eliminations of operating profits are related to intercompany inventory transfers that are deferred
until shipment is made to third party customers.  In 2002, the
Royal Dutch Shell Group of Companies accounted for approximately 14% of revenues and in 2003 no single customer accounting for more than 10% of the Companys revenues. In 2004, the Companys top 15 customers represented approximately 61%
of total revenues, with ConocoPhillips accounting for approximately 15% of revenues.  11.Employee Stock Option Plan and Awards  On September 19, 1997, the Company adopted the Dril-Quip, Inc. 1997 Incentive Plan as amended, the 1997 Plan and the Company reserved 1,700,000 shares of Common Stock for use in connection with the 1997
