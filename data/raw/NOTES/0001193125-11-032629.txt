Significant accounting policies:  a
Description of the business: 
Vitran Corporation Inc. Vitran or the Company is a North American provider of freight services and distribution
solutions to a wide variety of companies and industries. Vitran offers less-than-truckload LTL service throughout Canada and the United States. Vitrans supply chain operation SCO offers logistics solutions in Canada
and the United States, including warehousing, inventory management and flow-through distribution facilities, as well as freight brokerage services.  b
Basis of presentation: These
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation. 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
GAAP. The Ontario Business Corporations Act regulations allow issuers that are required to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States to file financial statements under United States GAAP to meet
their continuous disclosure obligations in Canada. All amounts in these consolidated financial statements are expressed in United States dollars, unless otherwise stated. c
New accounting pronouncements: 
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standard Codification FASB ASC Update No2010-06,
Improving Disclosure about Fair Value Measurements, requires enhanced disclosures about recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements including significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and information on
purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis of Level 3 fair value measurements. FASB ASC update No2010-06 was adopted January1, 2010 except for the requirement to separately disclose purchases, sales, issuances and
settlements of recurring Level 3 fair value measurements which is effective January1, 2011.  d
Foreign currency translation: A
majority of the Companys shareholders, customers and industry analysts are located in the United States. Accordingly, the Company has adopted the United States dollar as its reporting currency. The United States dollar is the functional
currency of the Companys operations in the United States. The Canadian dollar is the functional currency of the Companys Canadian operations. Each operation translates foreign currency-denominated transactions into its functional
currency using the rate of exchange in effect at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a
foreign currency are translated into the functional currency of the operation using the year-end rate of exchange giving rise to a gain or loss that is recognized in income during the current year. 
For reporting purposes, the Canadian operations are translated into United States dollars using the current rate method. Under this
method, all assets and liabilities are translated at the year-end rate of

Significant accounting policies continued: 
exchange and all revenue and expense items are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year. The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a separate component of
shareholders equity. United States dollar debt of $563 million 2009 - $710 million is designated as a hedge of the
investment in the United States dollar functional operation, such that related transaction gains and losses are recorded in the separate component of shareholders equity. In respect of other transactions denominated in currencies other than the Canadian dollar, the monetary assets and liabilities of the Company are translated at the year-end rates. Revenue and expenses are
translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the transaction dates. All of the exchange gains or losses resulting from these other transactions are recognized in income. e
Revenue recognition: The
Companys LTL segment and freight brokerage business unit recognize revenue upon the delivery of the related freight and direct shipment costs as incurred. For the LTL segment, revenue for transportation services not completed at the end of a
reporting period is recognized based on relative transit time in each period with expenses recognized as incurred. Revenue for the SCO operation is recognized as the management services are provided. 
Within the LTL business unit, revenue adjustments are estimated at the end of each quarterly reporting period. These adjustments result
from several factors, including weight and freight classification verifications, shipper bill of lading errors, pricing discounts and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments. The revenue adjustments are recorded as a reduction in revenue from
operations and accrued for as part of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as a contra-account to accounts receivable. Historical experience, trends and current information are used to update and evaluate the estimate. As at December31, 2010, revenue adjustments as a percentage of revenue were not material.
f
Accounts receivable: Accounts
receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $27 million at December31, 2010 2009 - $35 million.  g
Cash and cash equivalents: Cash
and cash equivalents include cash on account and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less and are stated at cost, which approximates market value. h
Inventory: Inventory consists
of tires and spare parts and is valued at the lower of average cost and replacement cost.

i
Property and equipment: 
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis from the date
assets are put in service over their estimated useful lives as follows:  Buildings
30 - 315 years
Leasehold interests and improvements
Over term of lease
Vehicles Trailers and containers
12 years
Trucks
8 years Machinery and equipment
5 - 10 years Tires
purchased as part of a vehicle are capitalized as a cost to the vehicle. Replacement tires are expensed when placed in service.  j
Assets held for sale: The
Company has certain assets that are classified as assets held for sale. These assets are carried on the balance sheet at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value, less cost to sell. Once an asset is classified as held for sale, there
is no further depreciation taken on the asset. At December31, 2010, the net book value of assets held for sale was approximately $45 million. This amount is included in property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. k
Goodwill and intangible assets: 
FASB ASC 350 requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently if
indicators of impairment exist, using fair value measurement techniques. The goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to measure the amount of impairment
loss, if any. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination. Determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgemental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and
assumptions. As at September30, 2010, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test and concluded there was no impairment. At December31, 2010, the Company has not identified any indicators that would require re-testing for impairment. Intangible assets consist of not-to-compete covenants and customer relationships and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected lives ranging from threeto eight years. During 2010
and 2009, the Company has not identified any indicators that would require testing for an impairment. One of the indicators of
impairment is a sustained decline in the Companys share price whereby the market capitalization of the Company is less than its book value for an extended period of time. At December31, 2008, before recording goodwill impairment charges,
the carrying value of Vitrans net assets were $1871 million compared to the market capitalization of all of the Companys outstanding shares which was $845 million.

Significant accounting policies continued: 
The market valuation of the Company declined during the fourth quarter as Vitrans
share price on the Nasdaq stock market decreased from $1347 at September30, 2008 to $626 at December31, 2008. These factors and the depressed macroeconomic environment indicated a triggering event had occurred requiring the Company, at
a reporting unit level, to test for the impairment of goodwill at December31, 2008. Using the income and market approach for estimating the fair value of each reporting unit, management concluded that the goodwill in its LTL segment was
impaired and there was no impairment of goodwill in its other reporting units. The impairment analysis concluded that the LTL segments goodwill was impaired requiring a pre-tax non-cash charge of $1074 million at December31, 2008.
FASB ASC 820-10-05 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3 measurement. The fair value used to value the Companys
goodwill is Level 3.  l
Income taxes: The Company uses
the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the deferred tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Significant judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the year that includes the date of enactment. FASB ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FASBASC740-10, requires that uncertain tax positions are evaluated in a two-step process, whereby ithe
Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and iifor those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company
would recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.  m
Share-based compensation: Under
the Companys stock option plan, options to purchase common shares of the Company may be granted to key employees, officers and directors of the Company by the Board of Directors or by the Companys Compensation Committee. There are
864,700 options outstanding under the plan. The term of each option is 10years and the vesting period is five years. The exercise price for options is the trading price of the common shares of the Company on The Toronto Stock Exchange on the
day of the grant. Note 9b provides supplemental disclosure for the Companys stock options. n
Advertising costs: Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs amounted to $324 in 2010 2009 - $376; 2008 - $462.

o
Impairment of long-lived assets: 
An impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used exceeds the sum of undiscounted cash flows
expected from its use and disposal, and is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value. A long-lived asset should be tested when events or circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be
recoverable. During 2010 and 2009, the Company has not identified any indicators that would require testing for an impairment.  p
Derivative instruments: 
Derivative instruments are used to hedge the Companys exposure to changes in interest rates. All derivatives are recognized on the
consolidated balance sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices and are recorded in either current or non-current assets or liabilities based on their maturity. Changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded in income or other
comprehensive income, based on whether the instrument is designated as a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified to income in the
period the hedged item affects income.If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, any associated amounts reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified into income at that time. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in income in
the current year.  q
Claims and insurance accruals: 
Claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated total cost of claims, including amounts for claims incurred but not reported, for
cargo loss and damage, bodily injury and property damage, workers compensation, long-term disability and group health. In Canada and the United States, the Company has self-insurance retention amounts per incident for auto liability, casualty
and cargo claims. In the United States, the Company has self-insurance retention amounts per incident for workers compensation and employee medical. In establishing these accruals, management evaluates and monitors each claim individually, and
uses factors such as historical experience, known trends and third party estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability.  r

s
Deferred share units: The
Company maintains a deferred share unit DSU plan for all directors. Under this plan, all directors receive units at the end of each quarter based on the market price of common shares equivalent to Cdn. $2,50000. The Company records
compensation expense and the corresponding liability each period initially for Cdn. $2,50000 and subsequently based on changes in the market price of common shares. In addition to the directors DSU plan, the Company adopted a DSU plan for senior executives. Under this plan, eligible senior executives receive units at the end of each quarter based on the market
price of common shares equivalent to the senior executives entitlement. The entitlement amount varies based on the senior executives position in the Company and the years of eligible service. The maximum entitlement amount varies between
$2,50000 and $20,00000 per annum. The Company records compensation expense and the corresponding liability each period based on the market price of common shares.  t
Use of estimates: The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year. Significant estimates are used in determining, but not limited to, the allowance for doubtful accounts, deferred tax assets, claims and insurance
accruals, share-based compensation, fair value measurements, intangible asset values and the fair value of reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment tests. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 2.
Discontinued operations: 
On November30, 2010, the Company completed the sale of selected assets of Frontier Transport Corporation, Vitrans truckload
operation, which was previously a reportable segment. The proceeds from the transaction were $30 million plus a $01 million working capital adjustment. The following table summarizes the operations for all periods presented to classify

Risk management activities: The Company is exposed to market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal
course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. Interest rate swaps: 
The Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing variable rate debt. The Company has entered into
variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps on variable rate term debt and revolving debt to limit its exposure to changing interest rates and future cash flows for interest. The interest rate swaps provide for the Company to pay an amount equal to a
specified fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount and to receive in return an amount equal to a variable rate of interest times the same notional amount. The swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The effective portions of
changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized into income in the same

year in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. Ineffective portions of changes in fair value are recognized into income as they occur. At December31, 2010, the notional
amount of the swaps was $160 million, with the average pay rate being 507% and the average receive rate being 030%. The swaps mature at various dates up to December31, 2011. 
Effective January1, 2008, the Company adopted FASB ASC 820-10, which provides a framework for measuring fair value under United
States GAAP. As defined in FASB ASC 820-10, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price.The Company
utilizes market data or assumptions that the Company believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.These inputs can be
readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable. The Company primarily applies the income approach for
recurring fair value measurements and endeavours to utilize the best available information. Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.The
Company is able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. FASB ASC 820-10-05 establishes a
fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 measurement and the lowest priority to
unobservable inputs Level 3 measurement. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include the
following as of December31:  2010
