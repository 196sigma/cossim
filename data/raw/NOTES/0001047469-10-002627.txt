MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
The consolidated financial statements of Ballantyne Strong,Inc. and Subsidiaries and the other information contained in this
Annual Report on Form10-K were prepared by and are the responsibility of management. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America and necessarily include amounts based on management best estimates and judgments. 
In
fulfilling its responsibilities, management relies on a system of internal controls, which provide reasonable assurance that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial
statements and maintaining accountability of assets. Internal controls are designed to reduce the risk that material errors or irregularities in the financial statements may occur and not be timely
detected. These systems are augmented by written policies, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, an organizational structure providing for the division of responsibilities and a
program of financial, operational and systems reviews. 
The
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed of four non-employee directors, is responsible for recommending to the Board of Directors the independent accounting
firm to be retained each year. The Audit Committee meets regularly, and when appropriate separately, with the independent auditors and management to review the Company performance. The independent
auditors and the Audit Committee have unrestricted access to each other in the discharge of their responsibilities.

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Ballantyne Strong,Inc.: 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ballantyne Strong, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2009 and 2008, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2009.
In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement scheduleII. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement scheduleII based on
our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Ballantyne Strong, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31,
2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement scheduleII, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

Ballantyne Strong,Inc. and Subsidiaries      Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements      Years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007   1.Nature of Operations 
On May20, 2009, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to change the Company name from Ballantyne of
Omaha,Inc. to Ballantyne Strong,Inc. Ballantyne or the Company to align the Company with a name known to a majority of the Company customers and to provide branding to the
trademark name Strong. 
Ballantyne,
a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Strong Westrex,Inc., Strong Technical Services,Inc., Strong / MDI Screen Systems,Inc., and
the American West Beijing Trading Company,Ltd., design, develop, manufacture, service and distribute theatre and lighting systems. The Company products are distributed to movie exhibition
companies, sports arenas, auditoriums, amusement parks and special venues. 
2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
Use of Management Estimates 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results and changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect results of
operations and financial position in future periods. Certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the 2009 presentation. 
Revenue Recognition 
Ballantyne sells movie projectors which are highly complex and have many components that make up a complete system, which is referred
to as an integrated system. Each customer selects options for certain components in determining the integrated system they chose to purchase. To recognize revenue, the Company follows the
requirements of Accounting Standards Codification ASC Subtopic 605-10, Revenue RecognitionGeneral, which consists of
determining that: Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  
Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  
The seller price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  
Collectibility is reasonably assured Once
the customer has determined the features for their integrated system, the Company either manufactures or integrates the system to their preference and then ships the system when
it is complete. Revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of the product to the third party. In those

Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
Years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 limited
situations where the shipping terms are FOB destination point, the Company recognizes revenue when the product is delivered. 
Trade Accounts Receivable  Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Amounts collected on trade accounts receivable
are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
The
Company maintained an allowance for doubtful accounts of $205,314 and $195,141 at December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. This allowance is developed based on several
factors including overall customer credit quality, historical write-off experience and a specific analysis that projects the ultimate collectability of the account. As such, these factors
may change over time causing the reserve level to adjust accordingly.  Consignment Inventory 
Digital and film projection equipment is provided to potential customers for consignment and demonstration purposes under customer use
agreements. The Company
recognized revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 104, Revenue RecognitionGeneral, upon delivery of title to customer. The
Company considered the guidance contained within ASC Subtopic 605-10 to determine the proper accounting treatment for the agreements referenced above. 
Consignment
inventory is reviewed for impairment by comparing the inventory to estimated future usage and sales. Digital and film projection equipment on consignment amounted to
approximately $05million at December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or market and include appropriate elements of
material, labor and manufacturing overhead. Inventory balances are net of reserves of slow moving or obsolete inventory estimated based on management review of inventories on hand compared to
estimated future usage and sales. 
Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired through purchase business combinations.
Goodwill and intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually as well as when events and circumstances
indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Certain factors that may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include, but are not limited to, operating results that are lower than expected and
adverse industry or market economic trends. 
The
impairment testing requires management to estimate the fair value of the assets or reporting unit. The estimate of the fair value of the assets is determined on the basis of
discounted cash flows. In estimating the fair value, management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows, future revenues, and future earnings in addition to
other factors. The fair value of the reporting unit is then compared to the carrying amount of the assets to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date for the excess of the carrying
amount of the reporting unit assets over the fair value of the reporting unit assets.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
Years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 Intangible
assets with definite lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment. 
Property, Plant and Equipment 
Significant expenditures for the replacement or expansion of property, plant and equipment are capitalized. Depreciation of property,
plant and equipment is provided over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets using the straight-line method. For financial reporting purposes, assets are depreciated over the
estimated useful lives of 20years for buildings and improvements, 3 to 10years for machinery and equipment, 7years for furniture and fixtures and 3years for computers
and accessories. The Company generally uses accelerated methods of depreciation for income tax purposes. 
Major Maintenance Activities 
The Company incurs maintenance costs on all its major equipment. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. 
Income Taxes 
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. The Company uses an estimate of its annual effective rate at each
interim period based on the facts and circumstances at the time while the actual effective rate is calculated at year-end. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry
forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is
more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
Sales Taxes 
Sales taxes assessed by governmental authorities including sales, use, and excise taxes are on a net basis and therefore the
presentation of these taxes is excluded from revenues and is shown as a liability on the balance sheet until remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities. 
Research and Development and Engineering  Research and development and engineering costs are charged to operations in the period incurred. Such costs amounted to approximately
$714,000, $637,000 and $606,000 for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
Advertising Costs 
Advertising and promotional costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to approximately $772,000, $833,000 and $845,000 for the years
ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007  Fair Value of Financial and Derivative Instruments 
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures states the fair value is the price
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is the amount at which the instruments could
be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, debt, accounts payable and accrued expenses reported in the consolidated
balance sheets equal or approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. ASC
815-15 Derivatives and HedgingOverall, requires companies to recognize all derivative financial instruments
as either assets or liabilities at their fair value. During 2009, the Company maintained forward contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk related to transactions being conducted at the
Company Canadian subsidiary. The contracts did not have a material impact on the Company operations. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents  All short-term, highly liquid financial instruments are classified as cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets
and statements of cash flows. Generally, these instruments have maturities of three months or less from date of purchase. 
Earnings loss Per Common Share 
Basic earnings loss per share have been computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding.
Diluted earnings loss per share has been computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding after giving effect to potential common shares from dilutive stock
options. The following table provides a reconciliation between basic and diluted earnings loss per share:

The Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated
values. The Company uses the straight-line amortization method over the vesting period of the awards. The Company has historically issued shares upon exercise of stock options or vesting
of restricted stock from new stock issuances. 
Share-based
compensation cost that has been included in income loss from operations amounted to $379,325, $271,498 and $81,325 for the twelve months ended December31, 2009,
2008 and 2007,
respectively. No share-based compensation cost was capitalized as a part of inventory as of December31, 2009 and 2008.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Amortizable Intangibles 
The Company reviews long-lived assets and amortizable intangibles, exclusive of goodwill, for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with The Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets Subsection of Subtopic
360-10: Property, Plant and EquipmentOverall. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future
undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount
of the assets exceeds their fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. 
The
Company most significant long-lived assets subject to these periodic assessments of recoverability are property, plant and equipment, which have a net book value of
$36million at December31, 2009. The Company amortizable intangibles which are subject to recovery consist of trademarks, customer relationships and non-competition
agreements which have a carrying value of $11million at December31, 2009. Because the recoverability of property, plant and equipment and intangibles is based on estimates of future
undiscounted cash flows, these estimates may vary due to a number of factors, some of which may be outside of management control. To the extent that the Company is unable to achieve management
forecasts of future income, it may become necessary to record impairment losses for any excess of the net book value of property, plant and equipment or intangibles over their fair value. In addition,
the Company has long-lived assets which consist of the Company equity method investment in a joint venture. The Company would recognize a loss when there is a loss in value of the equity
method investment which is other than a temporary decline. No impairment existed at December31, 2009. 
Retirement Benefits 
The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC Subtopic 715-60: CompensationRetirement
BenefitsDefined Benefit PlansOther Postretirement which requires the recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset
or liability in the balance sheet, the measurement of a plan assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as

Years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 of
the end of the employer fiscal year, and the recognition of changes in the funded status through comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. 
Foreign Currency Translation 
For foreign operations, local currencies are considered the functional currency. The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are
translated into the United States dollar at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Revenue and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated using an average of the foreign
exchange rates in effect during the period. Translation adjustments are not included in determining net earnings loss but are presented in comprehensive income loss within the consolidated
statements of changes in shareholder equity and comprehensive income loss. 
Transaction
gains and losses that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the
statements of operations as incurred. 
Warranty Reserves 
The Company generally grants a warranty to its customers for a one-year period following the sale of all new equipment, and
on selected repaired equipment for a one-year period following the repair. The warranty period is extended under certain circumstances and for certain products. The Company accrues for
these costs at the time of sale or repair, when events dictate that additional accruals are necessary. 
The
following table summarizes warranty activity for the three years ended December31, 2009.

Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements 
In May 2008, the FASB issued ASC 105-10, Generally Accepted Accounting PrinciplesOverall. ASC Subtopic
105-10 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are
presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP. ASC 105-10 became effective 60days following the SEC approval of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board related amendments to remove the GAAP hierarchy from auditing standards. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial
statements. 
In
June 2009, the FASB issued ASC 105-10, Generally Accepted Accounting PrinciplesOverall. ASC 105-10 establishes the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification the Codification as a source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with U.S.GAAP. Rules and interpretative releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative U.S.GAAP. All guidance contained in
the Codification carries an equal level of authority. The Codification superseded all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other non-grandfathered,
non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification is non-authoritative. The FASB will not issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions or
Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts. Instead, it will issue Accounting Standards Updates ASU. The FASB will not consider ASU as authoritative in their own right. ASU will serve only to
update the Codification, provide background information about the guidance and provide the bases for conclusions on the changes in the Codification. The Codification became the exclusive
authoritative reference for nongovernmental U.S.GAAP for use in financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September15, 2009. The adoption of this
Codification did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No46R to be included in ASC Topic
810. This statement requires reporting entities to evaluate former QSPE for consolidation, changes to approach to determining a VIE primary beneficiary from a quantitative assessment to a
qualitative assessment designed to identify a controlling financial interest. This statement is effective as of the beginning of a Company first fiscal year that begins after November15,
2009. The Company does not believe the adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
In
January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic820: Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, which amends
Subtopic829-10. ASU2010-06 enhances disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements. Certain provisions of ASU2010-06 are
effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December15, 2009 and others for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2010. Beginning with the quarter-ended
March31, 2010, the Company will provide new disclosures, as applicable to its fair value instruments. The disclosures required for fiscal periods beginning after December15, 2010 are
currently not applicable to the Company.

Table of Contents Ballantyne Strong,Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
Years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 approximately
$004million at December31, 2009. The Guarantees will expire by the end of June 2012.  6.Sale of Product Line 
During 2008, the Company sold its coater and marinade product line in exchange for $275,000 in cash. In connection with the sale, the
Company recorded a pre-tax net gain of approximately $258,000 estimated $159,000 after-tax which is net of related costs to sell. 
7.Investments 
The Company had certain investments in auction-rate securities which were classified as
available-for-sale securities and accounted for in accordance with SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. In June 2009, the
Company entered into a settlement agreement with a financial institution with whom the Company had a banking relationship to sell, at the Company option, all or a portion of its outstanding
auction-rate securities ARS at par, plus accrued interest. The settlement agreement provided for a provision on confidentiality and a release of the financial institution from claims
related to the Company purchase, ownership and sale of the securities. Subsequently, in June 2009, the Company sold its remaining outstanding ARS under the terms of the settlement agreement which
amounted to $9,375,000 plus interest accrued. During 2009, the Company also liquidated, at par, outstanding ARS which amounted to $650,000 of which $50,000 were sold through the normal auction process
and $600,000 were redeemed by the fund itself. 
The
Company previously recorded a temporary impairment as an unrealized loss on the outstanding ARS in other comprehensive income loss prior to settlement of the ARS. As a result of
entering into the settlement agreement, the Company recorded the temporary impairment as a realized loss of approximately $11million within other income expense. The Company also recorded
an offsetting gain on the settlement in the amount of $11million which was recorded in other income expense during twelve months ended December31, 2009.

8.Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The fair value of the Company cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses equal or
approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The estimated fair values and related assumptions used to estimate fair value of the Company financial
instruments are disclosed below. 
ASC
820 establishes a hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon observable independent market inputs and unobservable market assumptions. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liability, including assumptions about risk. Considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of
fair
value. The following represents the three categories of inputs used in determining the fair value of financial assets and liabilities: 
Level1 Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level2 Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level3 Unobservable inputs that are used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market
participants in pricing the asset or liability. 
A
reconciliation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs Level3 from January1, 2009 to
December31, 2009 follows:

11.Intangible Assets  As of December31, 2009 and December31, 2008, the Company had unamortized identifiable net assets of $1,103,128 and
$1,374,438, respectively. The following table details amounts relating to those assets. 
December31, 2009 
2008  Amortizable intangible assets Customer relationships 1,706,003 1,599,393 Trademarks 227,470 208,282 Non-competition agreement 166,158 164,623  2,099,631 1,972,298 Accumulate amortization Customer relationships 741,061 448,060 Trademarks 165,066 94,034 Non-competition agreement 116,376 81,766  1,022,503 623,860 
The
increase in the cost of the identifiable assets is due to certain intangibles recorded in a foreign currency and therefore affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate.
Additionally, the Company had intangible net assets of $26,000 at December31, 2009 with indefinite lives and therefore will not be
amortized. Intangible assets, other than goodwill, with definitive lives are amortized over their useful lives. 
During
2007, the Company purchased certain intangible assets pertaining to an agreement between High End Systems and the Company. The assets were recorded at fair value. Customer
relationships are being amortized over a useful life of four years, non-compete intangibles are being amortized over a useful life of three years. The trademark intangible was determined
to have an indefinite life and therefore will not be amortized. 
During
2007, the Company purchased certain intangible assets pertaining to the stock acquisition of Marcel Desrochers,Inc. These assets were recorded at fair value. Customer
relationships and the non-competition agreement are being amortized over useful lives of five years and the trademark is being amortized over three years. 
The
Company recorded amortization expense relating to other identifiable intangible assets of $398,642, $421,113 and $162,377 for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. Future amortization expenses related to the intangibles recorded at December31, 2009 are as follows: 2010$373,428; 2011$329,180;
2012$269,472; 2013$43,476; thereafter$61,572. 
12.Sale of Design Manufacturing,Inc. 
During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Design Manufacturing,Inc. Design in exchange for $17million in cash. In connection with the sale, the Company recorded a loss on the sale of $01million.

Table of Contents Ballantyne Strong,Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
Years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007  13.Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired through purchase business combinations in
accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill
and intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually as well as when events and circumstances indicate that
an impairment may have occurred. 
The
impairment testing requires management to estimate the fair value of the assets or reporting unit. The Company assesses the current fair values of each reporting unit based on an
income approach using discounted cash flows. In estimating the fair value, management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows, future revenues, and future
earnings in addition to other factors. The fair value of the reporting unit is then compared to the carrying amount of the assets to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date for the
excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit assets over the fair value of the reporting unit assets. 
During
2008, the Company operating performance declined as compared to the prior year and the share price and market capitalization was depressed as compared to book value. The
analyses also took into consideration the ongoing transition taking place in the Company strategy and operations, moving from the manufacture of traditional film equipment to a business model
focused on the distribution and service of digital projectors. As a result of the impairment analysis performed, the Company determined the entire carrying value of goodwill was impaired during the
fourth quarter of 2008. 
The
following table shows the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to each applicable segment: 
Theatre 
Lighting 
Total  Balances at December31, 2006 1,794,426 1,794,426 Increase due to acquisition 1,193,161 91,000 1,284,161 Impairment charge 639,466 639,466 Change in foreign currency exchange rates 18,128 18,128 Balances at December31, 2007 2,329,993 91,000 2,420,993 Impairment charge 2,223,282 91,000 2,314,282 Change in foreign currency exchange rates 106,711 106,711 Balances at December31, 2008 
Accordingly,
the Company took a 2008 non-cash charge amounting to $23million. The effect of the charge increased 2008 reported net loss and loss per share. A tax
benefit related to the impairment charges taken during 2008 of $02million was recognized.

Federal
and state income taxes have not been provided on accumulated but undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately $77million at
December31, 2009, as such earnings have been permanently reinvested in the business. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed
earnings is not practicable. 
The
Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC 740, Income Taxes as it pertains to uncertain tax positions. ASC 740 requires
that uncertain tax positions are evaluated in a two-step process, whereby 1the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based
on the technical merits of the position and 2for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the Company would recognize the largest amount of tax benefit
that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. The Company uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain subject to
examination by the relevant taxable authorities. The Company has examinations not yet initiated for Federal purposes for fiscal years 2005 through 2008. In most cases, the Company has examinations
open for State or local jurisdictions based on the particular jurisdiction statute of limitations. The Company does not currently have any examinations in process. As of December31, 2009,
total unrecognized tax benefits amounted to approximately $01million. 
Estimated
amounts related to estimated underpayment of income taxes, including interest and penalties, are classified as a component of tax benefit expense in the consolidated
statements of operations and were not material for the year ended December31, 2009. Amounts accrued for estimated underpayment of income taxes amounted to $01million as of
December31, 2009. The accruals largely related to state tax matters.

health care trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans. A 1% change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following
effects:

Decrease  Effect on total service and interest cost components of periodic postretirement health care benefit cost 1,987 1,781 Effect on the health care component of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 33,756 30,244 
For
measurement purposes, a 65% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2009. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 60%
through 2011 and remain at that level thereafter.

The
Company expects to contribute $17,342 to its postretirement benefit plan in 2010. 
The
benefits expected to be paid from the postretirement benefit plan in each year 2010-2014 are $17,342, $18,485, $19,553, $20,528 and $21,500, respectively. The aggregate
benefits expected to be paid in the five years from 2015-2019 are $104,110. The expected benefits are based on the same assumptions used to measure the Company benefit obligation at
December31 and include estimated future employee service. 
d.Concentrations 
The
Company top ten customers accounted for approximately 49% of 2009 consolidated net revenues. The top ten customers were primarily from the theatre segment. Trade accounts
receivable from these
customers represented approximately 52% of net consolidated receivables at December31, 2009. Sales to Regal Cinemas,Inc. and Vari International each represented approximately 10% of
consolidated sales. Additionally, receivables from NEC and the China Film Jingdian Cinema Investment Company, Ltd represented approximately 9% and 16% of net consolidated receivables at
December31, 2009, respectively. While the Company believes its relationships with such customers are stable, most arrangements are made by purchase order and are terminable at will by either
party. A significant decrease or interruption in business from the Company significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company business, financial condition and results of
operations. The Company could also be adversely affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency rates and weak economic and political conditions in each of the countries in which the Company
sells its products. 
Financial
instruments that potentially expose the Company to a concentration of credit risk principally consist of accounts receivable. The Company sells product to a large number of
customers in many different geographic regions. To minimize credit concentration risk, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition.

Through
distribution agreements with NEC, the Company distributes Starus DLP Cinema projectors to North and South America, Hong Kong, China and certain other areas of Asia. These
agreements are non-exclusive distributorship agreements and some of which can be terminated with 90day advance notice. NEC is the primary supplier of the digital products the
Company distributes to the Theatre Industry. If the Company is unable to maintain its relationship with NEC, the results would have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition and
operating results until the Company could find an alternative source of digital equipment to distribute. The principal raw materials and components used in the Company manufacturing processes
include aluminum, reflectors, electronic subassemblies and sheet metal. The Company uses a single manufacturer for each of its intermittent movement components, reflectors, aluminum castings, lenses
and xenon lamps. Although the Company has not to-date experienced a significant difficulty in obtaining these components, no assurance can be given that shortages will not arise in the
future. The loss of any one or more of such contract manufacturers could have a short-term adverse effect on the Company until alternative manufacturing arrangements are secured. 
e.Leases The
Company and its subsidiaries lease plant and office facilities, furniture, autos and equipment under operating leases expiring through 2012. These leases generally contain renewal
options and the Company expects to renew or replace the leases in the ordinary course of business. Rent expense under operating lease agreements amounted to approximately $440,000, $316,000 and
$126,000 for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As
part of the acquisition of Marcel Desrochers,Inc. on October12, 2007, the Company entered into a lease agreement for the manufacturing facilities located in Canada
which are primarily used for the manufacture of motion picture theatre screens. The term of the lease is for sixty months which expires on October12, 2012. 
Future
minimum lease payments for operating leases having initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of December31, 2009 are as follows:
2010$446,869; 2011$420,616; 2012$227,329; and 2013$22,821. f.Self-Insurance 
The
Company is self-insured up to certain stop loss limits for group health insurance. Accruals for claims incurred but not paid as of December31, 2009 and 2008 are
included in accrued group health insurance claims in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company policy is to accrue the employee health benefit accruals based on historical
information along with certain assumptions about future events. 
g.Litigation During
December 2009, the Company settled an asbestos case entitled Larry C. Stehman and Leila Stehman v. Asbestos Corporation, Limited and Ballantyne of
Omaha,Inc. individually and as successor in interest to Strong International, Strong Electric Corporation and Century Projector Corporation, et al, in the Superior
Court of the State of California, County of San Francisco. The settlement, including legal fees resulted in charges of $04million during the year ended December31, 2009. 
The
