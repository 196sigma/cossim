REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Board of Directors
Peerless Group, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Peerless
Group, Inc. the Company, as of December 31, 1995 and 1996, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and stockholders' equity
deficit for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Peerless
Group, Inc., at December 31, 1995 and 1996, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY
Peerless Group, Inc., formerly known as TPG Holdings, Inc. the Company,
is a computer software company which develops and provides banking and credit
union software systems and services. The Company markets these systems along
with the computer equipment hardware to financial institutions primarily
located in the United States and provides conversion, support and maintenance
services to customers using the systems. In conjunction with the initial
public offering of its common stock on October 3, 1996 the Offering, TPG
Holdings, Inc. formed a new wholly owned Delaware subsidiary, Peerless Group,
Inc., and TPG Holdings, Inc. was merged into this new corporation. The
financial statements included herein reflect the merger and resulting change
in capitalization as all share and per share amounts have been retroactively
restated to reflect the merger. In conjunction with this change in
capitalization, all treasury shares outstanding were cancelled.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of
the Company and all its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances are eliminated.
2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds and certificates of
deposit and Treasury Bills with original purchased maturities of three months
or less.
DEPRECIATION
Depreciation is provided on computer and other equipment using the straight-
line method over a five- to ten-year estimated useful life.
COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS
Computer software and maintenance contracts consist of fair values assigned
to acquired software and maintenance contracts. The amounts are being
amortized over the estimated economic benefit period of five years. The
amounts amortized and charged to cost of sales were approximately $1,116,000 308,000 and $403,000 in 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively.
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE
The Company expenses all software development costs as incurred until
technological feasibility has been established for the product, at which time
the costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release
to customers.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company sources of revenue and the methods of revenue recognition are
as follows:
Software license and installation fees--Revenues from software
contracts involving installation are recognized when the installation
is performed according to contractual terms, which, in the case of
long-term contracts, involves the use of the percentage-of-completion
method of accounting. Progress towards completion is measured based
upon the percentage relationship that costs incurred to date bear to
total estimated costs to complete the installation. Revenues from
license fees not involving installation are recognized upon delivery of
the software and acceptance by the customer when no significant vendor
obligations remain.

PEERLESS GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Hardware and equipment sales--Commissions and revenues from hardware
and equipment sales are recognized upon shipment by the manufacturer.
Maintenance and service fees--Revenues from maintenance and service
contracts are recognized ratably over the periods of the respective
contracts.
UNEARNED REVENUES
Deposits received and amounts billed for software licenses, installation and
hardware in advance of installation or delivery, and for annual software
maintenance prior to performance of related services, are reflected as
unearned until such amounts are recognized in accordance with the Company
revenue recognition policy.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK CONCENTRATION
Cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable,
accrued liabilities and unearned revenues are stated at expected settlement
values which approximate fair value.
Trade accounts receivable potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk as the Company markets its products and services primarily to
financial institutions throughout the United States. The Company performs
periodic credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and
generally does not require collateral; however, deposits for future services
or products are frequently required.
STOCK OPTIONS
The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and related
Interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options because, as
discussed in Note 8, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under
FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123,
requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in
valuing employee stock options.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
NET INCOME LOSS PER COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARE
Net income loss per common and common equivalent share amounts are
computed using net income loss available for common stockholders, which is
calculated as net income loss less accretion of redeemable common stock, and
the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common equivalent
shares if dilutive using the treasury stock method. Common stock equivalents
consist of stock options and warrants. Pursuant to the Securities and Exchange
Commission Staff Accounting Bulletins, common and common equivalent shares
issued by the Company at prices below the initial public offering price during
the twelve-month period prior to the offering have been included in the
calculation as if they were outstanding for all periods presented.

3.DEBT AND CREDIT AGREEMENTS
LINE OF CREDIT
In January 1997, the Company amended its line of credit agreement with a
bank that provides for borrowings up to $2,500,000, reduced by the value of
outstanding letters of credit issued by the bank on behalf of the Company.
Borrowings using this line of credit bear interest at the bank prime rate
825% at December 31, 1996 plus 1/2% and are collateralized by the assets of
the Company wholly owned subsidiaries. The facility will expire on February
1, 1999. No amounts were outstanding on the line of credit at December 31,
1996, and a letter of credit in the amount of $600,000 was issued by the bank
on behalf of the Company at December 31, 1996.
The line of credit agreement contains restrictive covenants, the most
significant of which relate to minimum defined annual net income, quarterly
cash flow and the restriction on the payment of cash dividends. At December
31, 1996, the Company was in compliance with such covenants.
Under the terms of the line of credit agreement, the bank was issued a
warrant to purchase at any time on or before October 1, 2002, 115,680 shares
of the Company common stock at a purchase price of $542 per share. Included
in the warrant agreement is a provision allowing the bank to put the warrant
back to the Company at any time after October 1, 1999, at a price equal to the
then-current market price of the Company common stock. No value was assigned
to the warrant at the date of issuance and no accretion has been recorded
through December 31, 1995, as the Company determined that there is no
significant value separately assignable to the warrant and put option. In June
1996, the line of credit agreement was amended such that the provision
allowing the bank to put the warrant back to the Company was terminated.
LONG-TERM DEBT DUE TO RELATED PARTIES
The Company repaid all of its debt upon completion of the Offering. Long-
term debt payable to principal stockholders consisted of the following at
December 31, 1995 in thousands:
1989 Subordinated  $ 433
1993 Subordinated  2,500
Acquisition   694
3,627
Less current   494
$3,133
The 1989 and 1993 Subordinated Debentures bore interest at 13% and 12 respectively, per annum, payable monthly. The Acquisition notes consisted of
two separate notes. One of the notes was for $494,000, bore interest at 8% per
annum, payable quarterly, and was repaid in March 1996. The note for the
balance of $200,000 bore interest at 6% per annum, payable quarterly.
Under the terms of the Subordinated Debentures and the Acquisition notes,
the holders of the Subordinated Debentures the Holders were originally
issued warrants to purchase up to 65% of the Company common stock. After
giving effect to several transactions, including the repurchase of warrants
for $3,776,000 in cash and notes in prior years, which were recorded as
reductions to additional paid-in-capital, the Holders had warrants to purchase
375% of the outstanding common stock of the Company at December 31, 1995. In
June 1996, the Holders exercised warrants to purchase 505,710 shares of the
Company common stock, and in October 1996, in conjunction with the Offering,
they sold warrants to the underwriters to purchase 597,360 shares of the
Company common stock. Therefore, at December 31, 1996, the Holders owned
warrants to purchase 363,308

shares of the Company common stock. The warrants are exercisable at a price
of $0025 per share and expire four years from the date of the final payment
on the Subordinated Debentures.
4.INCOME TAXES
The Company uses the liability method in accounting for income taxes as
required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 Accounting
for Income Taxes. The components of the provision for income taxes are as

At December 31, 1996, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $190,000 which expire in 2009. Given the historical trends in
generating taxable income and the expected future earnings, in the fourth
quarter of 1996 the Company determined that it was more likely than not that
its net deferred tax assets would be realized. As a result of the Company
judgment, the valuation allowance was eliminated and a deferred tax benefit of
approximately $250,000 was recorded.

Rental expense totaled approximately $235,000, $247,000 and $269,000 for the
years ended December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively.
6.EMPLOYEE 401K PLAN
The Company has a plan which provides retirement benefits under the
provisions of Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code the Plan for
substantially all employees who have completed a specified term of service.
The Company contributions equal 50% of employee contributions, up to a
maximum of 6% of eligible employee compensation, as defined. Benefits under
the Plan are limited to the assets of the Plan.
Contributions by the Company charged to expense during the years ended
December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996, were approximately $74,000, $90,000 and
$122,000, respectively.
7.COMMON STOCK
On March 7, 1994, the Company president, a significant stockholder,
resigned his position with the Company. Under the terms of his resignation
agreement, the Company modified the terms of the stockholder options to
purchase 72,000 shares of the Company common stock, resulting in
compensation expense of $111,000. In addition, the stockholder obtained a put
option which required the Company to purchase up to 96,000 shares of his
holdings of the Company common stock on April 4, 1994, and up to 50,666
shares of his holdings of the Company common stock on June 1 in each of the
nine years thereafter, at a price per share

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

equal to $260 for shares sold during 1994, with the price per share to
increase by 6% each year thereafter. The 1994 and 1995 options for 96,000 and
50,666 shares, respectively, were exercised by the stockholder. The present
value of the total amount that may be payable under the put option was
recorded as redeemable common stock and as a reduction of additional paid-in-
capital on the balance sheet. The difference between the carrying value and
redemption amount of the common stock was accreted as a charge to
stockholders' equity deficit over the term of the put option. Upon
consummation of the Offering, the options underlying the put feature were
exercised, thereby eliminating the payable under the put option and the
redeemable common stock.
In July 1996, the Company adopted an employee stock purchase plan under
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under the
employee stock purchase plan, employees may make annual purchases of the
Company common stock at a price equal to 85% of the market value of the
common stock on certain specified dates. The Company has reserved 250,000
shares of its common stock for issuance under the employee stock purchase
plan.
During 1995 and 1996, the Company issued 102,480 and 19,620 shares,
respectively, of restricted stock to employees. The Company recorded
approximately $249,000 and $102,000, respectively, of unearned compensation
for the excess of the deemed value for accounting purposes of the common stock
issued over the proceeds received upon issuance. The unearned compensation is
charged to expense ratably over the vesting period of the common stock. During
1995 and 1996, approximately $54,000 and $98,000 were charged to operations.
8.STOCK OPTIONS
The Board of Directors and the stockholders of the Company approved the
Company Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan the 1990 Plan effective
as of October 1, 1990. In February, 1997, the Board of Directors of the
Company approved the Peerless Group, Inc. 1997 Stock Option Plan the 1997
Plan, subject to stockholder approval. The 1997 Plan will amend and restate
the 1990 Plan. The Company will reserve 450,000 shares of common stock for
future issuances under the 1997 Plan. Options under the 1997 Plan will be
granted at prices not less than the fair value of the common stock as
determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company Board of Directors
the Committee on the date of grant. Each option to be granted under the
1997 Plan will vest as determined by the Committee, but in no case can the
option term exceed ten years from the date of the option grant.
Historically, options awarded under the 1990 Plan have generally vested 20% on
the date of grant and 20% each year thereafter, with an exercise period of
five years from the date of grant.

8.STOCK OPTIONS CONTINUED
The total options outstanding at December 31, 1996, included 264,000 options
with exercise prices ranging from $125 to $287 and a weighted-average
remaining contractual life of 15 years; and 169,100 options with exercise
prices ranging from $542 to $880 and a weighted-average remaining
contractual life of 47 years. Exercisable options at December 31, 1996,
included 207,600 options with exercise prices ranging from $125 to $287 and
a weighted-average exercise price of $171; and 33,820 options with exercise
prices ranging from $542 to $880 and a weighted-average exercise price of
$761. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of the Company employee
stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of
grant, no compensation expense is recognized.
Pro forma information regarding net income and net income per share is
required by SFAS 123, and has been determined as if the Company had accounted
for its employee stock options under the fair value method of SFAS 123. The
fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-
Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions
for 1995 and 1996, respectively: risk-free interest rates of 737% and 579 volatility factors of the expected market price of the Company common stock
of 447 and 347; and no dividend yields. In addition, the fair value of these
options was estimated based on an expected life of one year from the vesting
date using the multiple option method.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of
highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
Because the Company employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in
the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value
estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock
options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting periods. The
Company pro forma information follows in thousands except for net income
per share information:
1995  1996
Pro forma net  $1,789 $2,170
Pro forma net income per  $ 048 $ 053
The pro forma disclosures only include the effect of options granted
subsequent to December 31, 1994. Accordingly, the pro forma information does
not reflect the pro forma effect of all previous stock option grants of the
Company, and thus is not indicative of future amounts until SFAS 123 is
applied to all outstanding stock options.
9.NOTE RECEIVABLE FROM OFFICER
During 1993, the Company made a loan to an officer in the amount of
$300,000. Amounts outstanding under this loan accrue interest monthly at 12%

payments on this loan totaled approximately $34,000. In June 1996, all
principal and interest amounts outstanding were repaid by the officer.
