ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
MILLENNIUM PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Millennium
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
consolidated results of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2000 the
Company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition.

MILLENNIUM PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2000 1] THE COMPANY
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Millennium or the Company
incorporates large-scale genetics, genomics, high throughput screening, and
informatics in an integrated science and technology platform. Millennium applies
this technology platform primarily in discovering and developing proprietary
therapeutic and diagnostic human healthcare products and services. 2] SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Millennium and
its majority-owned subsidiaries and other subsidiaries controlled by the
Company. The ownership of the other interest holders of the consolidated
subsidiaries is reflected as minority interest. There were no such other
interest holders as of December 31, 2000. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investment in the
Company unconsolidated joint venture is accounted for using the equity method
see Note 6.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES
Cash equivalents consist principally of money market funds and corporate
bonds with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase.
Marketable securities consist of high-grade corporate bonds, asset-backed and
U.S. government agency securities.
Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable
securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each
balance sheet date. Marketable securities at December 31, 2000 and 1999 are
classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at
fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in a
separate component of stockholders' equity. The cost of debt securities in this
category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to
maturity. Such amortization and accretion is included in investment income.
Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be
other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in investment
income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification
method. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale
are included in investment income.
There have been no significant realized gains or losses on sales of any
marketable securities in 2000, 1999, and 1998.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
Cash and cash equivalents are primarily maintained with two major financial
institutions in the United States. Deposits with banks may exceed the amount of
insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed
upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk. Financial instruments that
potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist
principally of marketable securities. Marketable securities consist of
high-grade corporate bonds, asset-backed and U.S. government agency securities.
The Company investment policy, approved by the Board of
49
MILLENNIUM PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 2000 2] SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Directors, limits the amount the Company may invest in any one type of
investment, thereby reducing credit risk concentrations.
SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company has identified three operating segments which, under the
applicable provision of SFAS No. 131, have been aggregated into one reportable
segment. Substantially all of the Company revenues have been derived from its
strategic alliances. Revenues from Aventis accounted for approximately 10% of
consolidated revenues for the 2000 Period. Revenues from Bayer accounted for
approximately 27%, 45% and 25% of consolidated revenues in the years 2000, 1999
and 1998, respectively. Revenues from Monsanto accounted for approximately 22 20% and 29% of consolidated revenues in the years 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. The 1999 and 1998 revenue precentages do not reflect the impact of
SAB 101. There were no other significant customers in 2000, 1999 and 1998.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts reported in the Company balance sheets for other
current assets and long-term debt approximate their fair value. The fair values
of the Company long-term debt are estimated using discounted cash flow
analyses based on the Company current incremental borrowing rates for similar
types of borrowing arrangements.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Equipment consists principally of
assets held under capitalized leases and those assets are stated at the present
value of future minimum lease obligations. Application development costs
incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are
capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position SOP No. 98-1,
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed for Internal Use.
Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and are amortized over the remaining
life of the building lease. Depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method
over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the
lease as follows                              
3 to 4 years
Capitalized  3 to 5 years
Leasehold  4 to 15 years INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets at December 31, 2000 consist of goodwill and other
intangible assets. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over
the useful lives of the respective assets, generally four years. Amortization
expense for all intangible assets was $551 million, $38 million, and
$27 million in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Accumulated amortization was
$640 million and $89 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. On a
periodic basis, the Company estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the
businesses to which the intangible assets relate in order to ensure that the
carrying value of such intangible assets has not been impaired.

DECEMBER 31, 2000 2] SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Effective October 1, 2000, Millennium changed its method of accounting for
revenue recognition in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101
SAB 101, REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Previously, the
Company had recognized revenue relating to non-refundable, up-front, license and
milestone payments and certain research funding payments from its strategic
partners in accordance with the contract. Under the new accounting method
adopted retroactively to January 1, 2000, the Company recognizes revenue from
non-refundable, up-front, license and milestone payments, not specifically tied
to a separate earnings process, ratably over the term of the research contract.
When payments are specifically tied to a separate earnings process, revenue is
recognized when earned. In addition, when appropriate, the Company recognizes
revenue from certain research payments based upon the level of research services
performed during the period of the research contract. The cumulative effect of
the change on prior years resulted in a charge to income of $1077 million,
which is included in the loss for the year ended December 31, 2000.
INCOME TAXES
The liability method is used to account for income taxes. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial
reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as net
operating loss carryforwards, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and
laws that will be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets
are reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with
their ultimate realization.
NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE
Basic net income loss per common share is computed using the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net
income loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of
common and dilutive common equivalent shares from stock options, warrants and
convertible debt using the treasury stock method. The 2000 and 1999 net loss
attributable to common stockholders is calculated by including the deduction of
a deemed preferred stock dividend relating to the excess of the fair value of
the Company common stock over the carrying value of the MPMx and MBio minority
interests acquired, respectively. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, diluted net
loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share, as the inclusion of
outstanding Common Stock options, warrants and convertible debt would be
antidilutive. At December 31, 1998, the difference between basic and diluted
shares used in the computation of earnings per share is approximately
48 million weighted-average common stock equivalent shares resulting from
outstanding Common Stock options and warrants.
STOCK DIVIDENDS
On April 12, 2000, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of
Certificate of Incorporation increasing the authorized Common Stock, $0001 par
value per share, of the Company from 100,000,000 shares to 500,000,000 shares.
On February 28, 2000 and September 7, 2000, the Board of Directors of the
Company declared two-for-one stock splits of the Company Common Stock. These
stock splits were effected in the form of 100% stock dividends paid on
April 18, 2000 and October 4, 2000, respectively, to stockholders of record as
of March 28, 2000 and September 27, 2000, respectively. Stockholders' equity has
been restated to give retroactive application to each stock split in prior
periods by reclassifying from additional paid-in capital to Common Stock the par
value of the additional shares

arising from the stock splits. In addition, all references in the consolidated
financial statements to the number of shares and per share amounts have been
restated.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
For operations outside the U.S. that prepare financial statements in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar, results of operations and cash flows are
translated at average exchange rates during the period, and assets and
liabilities are translated at end of period exchange rates. Foreign currency
transaction gains and losses are included in the results of operations and are
not material to the Company consolidated financial statements. Translation
adjustments are excluded from the determination of net loss and are accumulated
in a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in
stockholders' equity.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS
Comprehensive income loss is comprised of net income loss, unrealized
gains and losses on marketable securities and cumulative foreign currency
translation adjustments. Accumulated other comprehensive income as of
December 31, 2000 included $108 million and $03 million of unrealized gains on
marketable securities and cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments,
respectively. Comprehensive income loss is reflected in the consolidated
statements of stockholders' equity.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, in accounting for
its stock-based compensation plans, rather than the alternative fair value
accounting method provided for under Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under APB 25, when the exercise price
of options granted under these plans equals the market price of the underlying
stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is required. In accordance
with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 96-18, the Company records compensation
expense equal to the fair value of options granted to non-employees over the
vesting period, which is generally the period of service.
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. The effective date of this statement was
deferred to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000 by SFAS No. 137
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities--Deferral of
Effective Date of SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 133 was amended by SFAS No. 138
Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities.
The Company believes the adoption of this new accounting standard will not have
a significant effect on its financial statements. 3] SUBSIDIARIES
MILLENNIUM BIOTHERAPEUTICS, INC.
In May 1997, the Company established Millennium BioTherapeutics, Inc.
MBio as a subsidiary and, pursuant to a Technology Transfer and License
Agreement, transferred and/or licensed certain technology to MBio in exchange
for 9,000,000 shares of the subsidiary Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.
At that time, MBio entered into a strategic alliance with Eli Lilly and Company
Lilly for the

discovery and development of novel therapeutic proteins. Under the terms of a
related stock purchase agreement, Lilly purchased $20 million of Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock of MBio for an approximate 18% equity interest in
MBio. The accompanying consolidated financial statements for 1999 and 1998
include the accounts of MBio since inception. The minority interest in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations includes the minority
stockholder interest in the net loss of MBio for the years ended December 31,
1999 and 1998. In 1998, MBio entire net loss was attributed completely to the
minority stockholder because the minority stockholder provided all equity
funding for MBio in 1998.
In October 1999, Lilly was issued approximately 1,500,000 shares of
Millennium Common Stock in exchange for all shares of MBio Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock owned by it. Also in October 1999, MBio amended the terms of its
strategic alliance with Lilly. Under the amendment, the research program was
refocused from the discovery of new therapeutic proteins to further development
of the therapeutic proteins which had been identified in the course of the
research program. In December 1999, MBio was merged with and into Millennium.
The Company recorded a deemed preferred stock dividend of $279 million in 1999
relating to the excess of the fair value of its Common Stock over the carrying
value of the MBio minority interest acquired from Lilly.
The Company had entered into certain agreements with this subsidiary to
provide specific services and facilities at negotiated fees. Such fees amounted
to $105 million and $125 million in 1999 and 1998, respectively. The Company
had subleased approximately $06 million of equipment to MBio under an existing
capital lease agreement. All such intercompany transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.
MILLENNIUM PREDICTIVE MEDICINE, INC.
In September 1997, the Company established a wholly-owned subsidiary,
Millennium Predictive Medicine, Inc. MPMx, to develop products and services
to optimize the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management of disease. In
February 1999, MPMx announced the formation of a strategic alliance in the
diagnostic field with Becton, Dickinson and Company Becton Dickinson. In
March 1999, Becton Dickinson made an equity investment in MPMx of
$150 million, representing approximately an 11% voting interest in MPMx, and
paid a $30 million licensing fee to MPMx. The minority interest in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets represents the equity interest of
Becton Dickinson in MPMx as of December 31, 1999 and the minority interest in
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations includes the minority
stockholder interest in the net income of MPMx for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999. All intercompany transactions with this subsidiary
have been eliminated in consolidation.
On June 2, 2000, the Company acquired the outstanding Preferred and Common
Stock of its MPMx subsidiary that it did not already own, making MPMx a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The transaction was a stock-for-stock
merger. Under the terms of the agreement, MPMx shareholders, including Becton
Dickinson, received 08 shares of Millennium Common Stock in exchange for each
MPMx share. The total value of Millennium Common Stock received by MPMx
stockholders in the merger, based upon the fair value of Millennium Common Stock
on the date of the announcement of the merger, March 2, 2000, was approximately
$1436 million. The Company recorded a deemed preferred stock dividend of
$457 million in 2000 relating to the excess of the fair value of its Common
Stock over the carrying value of the MPMx minority interest acquired from Becton
Dickinson.

MILLENNIUM PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 2000 4] LEUKOSITE ACQUISITION
On December 22, 1999, the Company acquired LeukoSite, Inc. LeukoSite for
an aggregate purchase price of $5504 million primarily consisting of 26,707,732
shares of Common Stock and 3,536,348 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise of LeukoSite options and warrants. The value of the Common Stock issued
in connection with this merger was calculated using a fair value of $1863 per
share. This per share fair value represents the average closing price of the
Company Common Stock when the merger was announced. Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of LeukoSite options and warrants was assigned a fair value using the
Black-Scholes method. The transaction was recorded as a purchase for accounting
purposes and the consolidated financial statements include LeukoSite operating
results from the date of the acquisition. The purchase price was allocated to
the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair
values, with the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market
value of net tangible assets allocated to specific intangible assets and
goodwill as follows in thousands                              
$159,080
Assembled    2,920
Core   18,712
In-process research and   350,503
Total Allocated to  $531,215
During 2000, the Company determined that certain LeukoSite contingent
liabilities related to previous acquisitions made by LeukoSite were probable. As
a result, the Company accrued $159 million of contingent liabilities through an
increase to goodwill. Amounts allocated to goodwill, assembled workforce, and
core technology are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of
four years. Amortization expense related to these items was $466 million and
$11 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company also incurred a
one-time, noncash charge to operations in 1999 of $3505 million for acquired
in-process research and development. The valuation of acquired in-process
research and development represents the estimated fair value related to
incomplete projects that, at the time of the acquisition, had no alternative
future use and for which technological feasibility had not been established.
The cost approach was used to value assembled workforce. This approach
establishes the fair value of an asset by calculating the recruiting and loss of
productivity costs avoided by obtaining a pre-existent, trained, and fully
efficient team. To calculate avoided recruiting costs, a unit cost for hiring an
employee equivalent to each of those transferred to the Company was calculated
and applied to each employee acquired. The avoided loss in productivity was
calculated by quantifying the time required for an employee to reach full
productivity and applying the amount to each employee total average cost.
The income approach was used to establish the fair values of core technology
and in-process research and development. This approach establishes the fair
value of an asset by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to the
asset over its useful life and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back
to a present value. The discounting process uses a rate of return commensurate
with the time value of money and investment risk factors. Accordingly, for the
purpose of establishing the fair value of core technology and in-process
research and development, revenues for each future period were estimated, along
with costs, expenses, taxes and other charges. Revenue estimates were based on
54
MILLENNIUM PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 2000 4] LEUKOSITE ACQUISITION CONTINUED
estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in
technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by
the Company and its competitors.
With respect to the value of purchased research and development, the Company
considered, among other factors, the research and development project stage of
completion, the complexity of the work completed to date, the costs already
incurred, the projected costs to complete, the contribution of core technologies
and other acquired assets, the projected date to market and the estimated useful
life. The respective after-tax cash flows were then discounted back to present
value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The discount rates used in the
LeukoSite analysis ranged from 19% to 23 1/4%, depending upon the risk profile
of the asset.
The most significant purchased research and developments projects that were
in-process at the date of the acquisition consisted of a chemotherapeutic agent,
a humanized monoclonal antibody for oncology and non-oncology indications, and
10 molecules in preclinical development. In aggregate these projects represented
approximately 83% of the in-process value. The chemotherapeutic agent
represented approximately 39% of the in-process research and development value.
Key assumptions used in the analysis of the chemotherapeutic agent included
gross margin of 95% and a discount rate of 22%. The chemotherapeutic agent is a
new class of small molecules that acts by inhibiting the proteasome, the complex
of a cell which regulates the breakdown of proteins that are critical for cell
proliferation. As of the date of the acquisition, the project was expected to be
completed and commercially available in the U.S. in 2006, with an estimated cost
to complete of approximately $150 to $200 million. During 2000, the Company
reprioritized and expanded its clinical development strategy for this
chemotherapeutic agent and now believes the estimated costs to complete the
original project are approximately $400 million to $450 million.
The humanized monoclonal antibody represented approximately 20% of the
in-process research and development value. Key assumptions used in the analysis
of this project included gross margins of 100%, as revenue is royalty based, and
a discount rate of 19%. The primary indication for this humanized monoclonal
antibody, CAMPATH-Registered Trademark-, relates to the treatment of refractory
chronic lymphocytic leukemia for which Millennium & ILEX Partners, L.P. M
currently is seeking FDA approval. The antibody works by binding to an antigen
found on leukemia cells, thus triggering their destruction. As of the date of
the acquisition, the Biologics License Application BLA for the
CAMPATH-Registered Trademark- product was expected to be completed by the end of
1999 and the Company anticipated that the CAMPATH-Registered Trademark- product
would be commercially available in the U.S. in 2000. In December 2000, the FDA
Advisory Committee recommended accelerated approval of the
CAMPATH-Registered Trademark- product. The clinical trials for the other
indications for the humanized monoclonal antibody are expected to be completed
and products commercially available in the U.S. between 2003 and 2004. As the
BLA for the CAMPATH-Registered Trademark- product was near completion at the
time of the acquisition and the clinical trials for the other indications build
substantially on work already performed, the estimated cost to complete these
projects was not considered to be significant at the time of acquisition, nor is
it considered to be significant now.
The portfolio of molecules in preclinical development represented
approximately 24% of the in-process research and development value. As these
products are expected to be partnered, revenue will be royalty based. Therefore,
gross margins of 100% were used in the analysis. The discount rate used in
valuing the portfolio of preclinical molecules was 23 1/4%.
55
MILLENNIUM PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 2000 4] LEUKOSITE ACQUISITION CONTINUED
Molecules in preclinical development relate primarily to treatments for
inflammatory and autoimmune conditions and diseases, as well as treatments for
asthma and allergies. Of the ten molecules in the preclinical portfolio, the
first molecules are expected to be completed and commercially available in the
U.S. in 2005 with the remaining molecules expected to be completed and
commercially available in the U.S. between 2006 and 2008. At the date of
acquisition and at December 31, 2000, the estimated cost to complete all
projects in preclinical development was approximately $40 to $45 million.
The major risk associated with the timely completion and commercialization
of these products is the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the
technology based on the data of long-term clinical trials. If these projects are
not successfully developed, future results of operations of the Company may be
adversely affected. Additionally, the value of the other intangible assets
acquired may become impaired.
The Company believes that the assumptions used to value the acquired
intangibles and in-process research and development were reasonable at the time
of the acquisition and remain reasonable at December 31, 2000. No assurance can
be given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected
project revenues, development costs or profitability, or the events associated
with such projects, will transpire as estimated. For these reasons, among
others, actual results may vary from the projected results.
The following unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations have
been prepared as if the acquisition of LeukoSite had occurred on January 1, 1998

results that will be obtained in the future. 5] CDC ACQUISITION
On July 27, 2000, the Company acquired Cambridge Discovery Chemistry Ltd.
CDC, a subsidiary of Oxford Molecular Group, plc, for an aggregate purchase
price of $500 million. The transaction was recorded as a purchase for
accounting purposes and accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the
assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair
values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market value of
tangible assets acquired and
56
MILLENNIUM PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 2000 5] CDC ACQUISITION CONTINUED
liabilities assumed was allocated to intangible assets resulting in
$55 million of specific intangible assets relating to contracts and assembled
workforce and $489 million of goodwill. The acquisition did not result in an
in-process research and development charge. Intangible assets and goodwill are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over four years. The Company has not
presented pro forma results of operations as though CDC was acquired on
January 1, 1999 because the pro forma results are not materially different than
the actual results of operations recorded. The consolidated financial statements
include CDC operating results from the date of acquisition. 6] REVENUES AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES
The Company has formed strategic alliances with major participants in
marketplaces where its discovery expertise and technology platform are
applicable. These agreements include alliances based on the transfer of
technology platforms, alliances which combine technology transfer with a focus
on a specific disease or therapeutic approach, and disease-focused programs
under which the Company conducts research funded by its partners. The Company
disease-based alliances and alliances which combine technology-transfer with a
disease focus are generally structured as research collaborations. Under these
arrangements, the Company performs research in a specific disease area aimed at
discoveries leading to novel pharmaceutical small molecule products. These
alliances generally provide research funding over an initial period, with
renewal provisions, varying by agreement. Under these agreements, the Company
partners may make up-front payments, additional payments upon the achievement of
specific research and product development milestones, ongoing research funding
and/or pay royalties or in some cases profit-sharing payments to the Company
based upon any product sales resulting from the collaboration.
Effective October 1, 2000, Millennium changed its method of accounting for
revenue recognition in accordance with SAB 101. The cumulative effect of the
change resulted in a charge to income of $1077 million and relates to revenue
previously recognized by the Company that was deferred into future periods. The
pro forma amounts presented in the consolidated statements of operations were
calculated assuming the accounting change was made retroactively to prior
periods. Included in the 2000 revenue is $200 million of revenue that was
recognized in prior years relating to the adoption of SAB 101. The amount of
revenue to be recognized in future years that was included in the cumulative
effect of change in accounting principle is $416 million, $373 million 92 million and $5 million in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively.
SIGNIFICANT ALLIANCES BEGINNING IN 2000
On June 23, 2000, the Company entered into an alliance with Aventis
Pharmaceuticals Inc. Aventis, the pharmaceutical company of Aventis S.A.,
covering the joint development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment
of inflammatory diseases; joint development of new drug discovery technologies;
transfer of key elements of the Company technology platform to Aventis to
enhance its existing capabilities; and purchase of an equity interest in the
Company by Aventis. The companies have agreed to share the responsibility for
and cost of developing, marketing and manufacturing products arising from the
alliance, as well as profits in North America. Outside of North America, Aventis
is responsible for developing and marketing products arising from the alliance,
with a royalty obligation to the Company. Under a Technology Transfer Agreement,
the Company agreed to provide Aventis with rights to its drug discovery
technologies in exchange for payments of up to
57

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 2000 6] REVENUES AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES CONTINUED
$2000 million over a five-year period. Under an Investment Agreement, Aventis
agreed to invest $2500 million in the Company Common Stock. As part of this
$2500 million equity investment, a $1500 million stock purchase was made in
the third quarter of 2000 and a $500 million stock purchase was made in
January 2001. An additional $500 million stock purchase is required to be made
in July 2001.
SIGNIFICANT ALLIANCES BEGINNING IN 1999
On February 22, 1999, MPMx and Becton Dickinson formed a strategic alliance
in the diagnostic field. The five-year, genomics-based research collaboration
focuses on several areas of oncology. Under the alliance, MPMx has agreed to
undertake a research program to identify genetic markers and related assays that
may be used to develop diagnostic products for several types of cancer. Becton
Dickinson has agreed to manufacture and market any products that result from the
research of MPMx, and MPMx will receive a royalty based upon gross profits from
any related product sales. On March 31, 1999, Becton Dickinson made a fair
market value equity investment in MPMx of $150 million, representing
approximately an 11% voting interest in MPMx, and paid a $30 million licensing
fee to MPMx. On June 2, 2000 the Company acquired the outstanding Preferred and
Common Stock of MPMx. Becton Dickinson received 08 shares of Millennium Common
Stock in exchange for each MPMx share. Becton Dickinson has agreed to pay MPMx
up to $515 million in research funding and additional annual license fees over
the term, provided the alliance continues for the full five-year term. Becton
Dickinson has agreed to pay milestones and royalties to MPMx in connection with
the commercialization and sale of any products developed through the alliance.
Through its merger with LeukoSite, the Company became a party to a joint
venture agreement with ILEX Products, Inc. ILEX to form Millennium and ILEX
Partners, L.P. M for the purpose of developing and commercializing the
CAMPATH-Registered Trademark- product, a monoclonal antibody for use in the
treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In August 1999, M and Schering AG
entered into a distribution and development agreement which grants Schering AG
exclusive marketing and distribution rights to the CAMPATH-Registered Trademark-
product in the U.S., Europe and the rest of the world except Japan and East
Asia, where M has retained rights. In the United States, Berlex
Laboratories, Inc., Schering U.S. affiliate, and M will share in the profits
from the sale of the CAMPATH-Registered Trademark- product. On sales made in the
rest of the territory, Schering AG has agreed to pay royalties equivalent to the
rate of profit sharing expected in the U.S. Under the terms of the agreement,
Schering has agreed to make payments of up to $300 million, of which
$200 million had been received at December 31, 2000, for rights to the
CAMPATH-Registered Trademark- product upon the achievement of certain regulatory
milestones. The joint venture currently intends to use these funds to pay for
ongoing development activities. The Company accounts for its investment in the
joint venture under the equity method of accounting. During the year ended
December 31, 2000, the Company recognized $56 million of revenue from research
and development activities performed on behalf of and to be reimbursed by M
At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company had an amount receivable of
$38 million and $03 million, respectively, included in Due from strategic
alliance partners, for amounts due from M, for such work.
In December 2000, the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee ODAC to the FDA
recommended accelerated approval of M CAMPATH-Registered Trademark- product.
In February 2001, M received a Class I complete response letter from the FDA.
In the letter, the FDA indicated that the timeframe for accelerated approval has
been extended for a 60-day period. M expects to complete ongoing discussions
with the FDA on final package labeling and design of a post-marketing
confirmatory study for the CAMPATH-Registered Trademark- product during this
time.

SIGNIFICANT ALLIANCES BEGINNING IN 1998 AND EARLIER
In September 1998, the Company entered into a strategic alliance with Bayer
AG Bayer. In November 1998, Bayer made an equity investment of
$966 million for approximately 198 million shares of Millennium Common Stock.
The primary goal of the alliance is for the Company to supply 225 drug targets
to Bayer over a period of five years. These targets will be identified as
relevant for cardiovascular disease, areas of oncology not covered by
Millennium alliance with Lilly, osteoporosis, pain, liver fibrosis, hematology
and viral infections. Future anticipated payments over the full alliance term
include $219 million of ongoing research program funding, as well as a potential
of up to $116 million of success fee payments for delivery of targets. Bayer has
the right to cancel the agreement after two and three years if certain minimum
target delivery objectives are not met.
In October 1997, the Company entered into a technology transfer alliance
through a collaborative agreement with Monsanto Company Monsanto. Under this
agreement, the Company granted to Monsanto exclusive rights to its technologies
in the field of plant agriculture, as well as a nonexclusive license to its
technologies outside the plant agriculture field. The Company has agreed to
collaborate exclusively with Monsanto in the application of those technologies
through the establishment of a subsidiary wholly owned by Monsanto. Monsanto
agreed to pay $118 million in up-front, licensing and technology transfer fees
over the five-year term of the agreement. Monsanto may also pay the Company up
to $100 million over five years, contingent upon the achievement of mutually
agreed-upon research objectives. Millennium may also receive royalty payments
from the sale of products, if any, originating from the research conducted by
the Monsanto subsidiary.
In July 1996, the Company entered into a strategic alliance with American
Home Products AHP to discover and develop targets and assays to identify and
develop small molecule drugs and vaccines for treatment and prevention of
disorders of the central nervous system. In addition, this agreement provides
for the license and transfer of certain technology to AHP. If certain specified
research objectives are not met, AHP may terminate the agreement in
September 2001. In August 1999, the Company extended the collaboration in the
area of central nervous system disorders for at least an additional two years.

$743 million and $592 million, with related accumulated amortization of
$394 million and $292 million.
The Company leases its laboratory and office space under operating lease
agreements with various terms and renewal options, including major facilities
with lease expirations ranging from 2002 through 2020. In addition to minimum
lease commitments, these lease agreements require the Company to pay its pro
rata share of property taxes and building operating expenses.
On August 4, 2000 the Company entered into lease agreements relating to two
buildings to be constructed for laboratory and office space. The leases commence
on the earlier of September 1, 2002 or the date on which the Company commences
occupancy. Both leases are for a term of seventeen years. The Company is
responsible for a portion of the construction costs for both buildings. The cost
to complete one of the buildings is expected to be approximately $310 million
and as the other building is in the design phase, construction costs are
currently being estimated for that building. Rent is calculated on an escalating
scale ranging from approximately $76 million, per building per year, to
approximately $97 million, per building per year. These amounts have been
excluded from the table below.
At December 31, 2000, the Company has pledged $296 million of marketable
securities, included in restricted cash, as collateral for letters of credit for
certain leased facilities.

connection with its research and development programs. Total future fixed
commitments under these agreements approximate $74 million in 2001 18 million in 2002 and $02 million in 2003. 10] CONVERTIBLE DEBT
In January 2000, the Company completed a sale, pursuant to Rule 144A of the
Securities Act of 1933, of $4000 million of 55% convertible subordinated notes
due January 15, 2007. The notes are convertible into Millennium Common Stock at
any time prior to maturity at a price equal to $4207 per share, subject to
adjustment, unless previously repurchased or redeemed by the Company under
certain circumstances. The notes are subordinated in right of payment to all
existing and future senior indebtedness of the Company. Under the terms of the
notes, the Company is required to make semi-annual interest payments on the
outstanding principal balance of the notes on January 15 and July 15 of each
year. To date, all required interest payments have been made.
During 2000, the Company paid an aggregate of $549 million in cash to
certain holders of Millennium convertible notes in order to induce the
conversion of their notes into Millennium Common Stock. These cash payments were
expensed during 2000. Interest accrued through the date of conversion was
charged to interest expense and was paid upon conversion. These conversions
resulted in the retirement of $3041 million of outstanding principal of
Millennium convertible notes, the issuance of approximately 72 million shares
of Millennium Common Stock, and the reclassification of deferred debt issuance
costs of $70 million to additional paid-in capital. 11] STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
