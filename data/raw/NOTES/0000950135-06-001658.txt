Item8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of MKS Instruments, Inc. We have completed integrated audits of MKS Instruments,
Inc.s 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and
of its internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003 consolidated
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our
opinions, based on our audits, are presented below. Consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the index appearing under a1 present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of MKS
Instruments, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2005
and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
index appearing under a2 presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read
in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in
Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A, that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005 based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion,
the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
COSO. The Companys management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on managements assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit
of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal
control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions. 34 Table of Contents A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts March14, 2006 35 Table of Contents MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC. CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS

worldwide provider of instruments, components, subsystems and
process control solutions that measure, control, power and
monitor critical parameters of semiconductor and other advanced
manufacturing processes. MKS is managed as one operating segment
which is organized around three product groups: Instruments and
Control Systems, Power and Reactive Gas Products and Vacuum
Products. MKS products are derived from its core
competencies in pressure measurement and control, materials
delivery, gas and thin-film composition analysis, electrostatic
change control, control and information management, power and
reactive gas generation and vacuum technology. 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
MKS Instruments, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries
collectively, the Company. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Net Income Per Share Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding, and diluted earnings per share is
based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding and all dilutive potential common equivalent shares
outstanding. The dilutive effect of options is determined under
the treasury stock method using the average market price for the
period. Common equivalent shares are included in the per share
calculations when the effect of their inclusion would be
dilutive. The following is a reconciliation of basic to diluted net income
per share

respectively, are excluded from the calculation of diluted net

The Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees using
the intrinsic value method as prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board 40 Table of Contents MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSCONTINUED Tables in thousands, except share and per share data APB Opinion No25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations.
Accordingly, no compensation expense is recorded for options
issued to employees in fixed amounts with fixed exercise prices
at least equal to the fair market value of the Companys
common stock at the date of grant. The Company has adopted the
provisions of SFASNo123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by
SFASNo148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure,
SFAS123 through disclosure only. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and net

There is no tax benefit included in the stock-based employee
compensation expense determined under the fair-value-based
method for the year ended December31, 2003, as the Company
had a full valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets
at December31, 2003. For the years ended December31,
2005 and 2004, stock-based employee compensation expense
included a tax benefit. The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted
during 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $827, $1124 and $1591per
option, respectively. The fair value of options at the date of
grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model

41 Table of Contents MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSCONTINUED Tables in thousands, except share and per share data In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued SFASNo123R,
Share-Based Payment SFAS123R.
SFAS123R replaces SFAS123 and supersedes
APB25. SFAS123R focuses primarily on the accounting
for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in
share-based payment transactions. SFAS123R requires
companies to recognize in the statement of operations the cost
of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity
instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards.
SFAS123R is effective for the Company as of the first
annual period that begins after June15, 2005. Accordingly,
the Company will adopt SFAS123R in its first quarter of
fiscal 2006. The Company expects to use the modified-prospective
transition method and will not restate prior periods for the
adoption of SFAS123R. Although the Company is currently
evaluating the provisions of SFAS123R and its implications
on its employee benefit plans, it believes that the adoption of
this standard, based on the terms of the options outstanding at
December31, 2005, will have a material effect on the
Companys net income for the year ending December31,
2006. On January7, 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of
outstanding stock options granted to employees and officers with
an exercise price of $2300 or greater. As a result of this
action, options to purchase approximately 16million
shares of the Companys common stock became exercisable on
January7, 2005. No compensation expense was recorded in
the Companys consolidated statement of operations for the
year ended December31, 2005 related to this action as
these options had no intrinsic value on January7, 2005.
For purposes of the SFAS123 pro forma calculation above,
the expense related to the options that were accelerated was
$16,886,000, net of tax, for the year ended December31,
2005. The reason that the Company accelerated the vesting of the
identified stock options was to reduce the Companys
compensation expense in periods subsequent to the adoption of
SFAS123R. Foreign Exchange The functional currency of the majority of the Companys
foreign subsidiaries is the applicable local currency. For those
subsidiaries, assets and liabilities are translated to
U.S.dollars at year-end exchange rates. Income and expense
accounts are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing
during the year. The resulting translation adjustments are
included in accumulated other comprehensive income in
consolidated stockholders equity. Foreign exchange
transaction gains and losses, which arise from transaction
activity and are reflected in operations, were immaterial in
2005, 2004 and 2003. Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales is recorded upon transfer of title
and risk of loss to the customer provided that there is evidence
of an arrangement, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and
collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. In
most transactions, the Company has no obligations to customers
after the date products are shipped other than pursuant to
warranty obligations. In some instances, the Company provides
installation and training to customers after the product has
been shipped. In accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF 00-21 Accounting For Revenue
Arrangements With Multiple Deliverables, the Company
defers the fair value related to any undelivered elements until
the undelivered element is delivered. Fair value is the price
charged when the element is sold separately. The Company
provides for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty
obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue.
Shipping and handling fees, if any, billed to customers are
recognized as revenue. The related shipping and handling costs
are recognized in cost of sales. Accounts receivable allowances
include sales returns and bad debt allowances. The Company
monitors and tracks the amount of product returns and reduces
revenue at the time of shipment for the estimated amount of such
future returns, based on historical experience. The Company
makes estimates evaluating its allowance for doubtful accounts.
The Company continuously monitors collections and payments from
its customers and maintains a provision for estimated 42 Table of Contents MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSCONTINUED Tables in thousands, except share and per share data credit losses based upon its historical experience and any
specific customer collection issues that it has identified. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Investments All highly liquid investments with a maturity date of three
months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash
equivalents. The fair value of short-term available-for-sale investments with

The appropriate classification of investments in securities is
determined at the time of purchase. Debt securities that the
Company does not have the intent and ability to hold to maturity
are classified as available-for-sale and are carried
at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on securities
classified as available-for-sale are included in accumulated
other comprehensive income in consolidated stockholders
equity. Gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses on
available-for-sale investments were not material at
December31, 2005 and 2004. At December31, 2005, the
fair value of available-for-sale investments with gross
unrealized losses was $16,993,000. Realized gains losses on
securities were immaterial in 2005, 2004 and 2003. The cost of
securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Inventories The Company values its inventory at the lower of cost
first-in, first-out
method or market. The Company regularly reviews inventory
quantities on hand and records a provision to write down excess
and obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable value, if
less than cost, based primarily on its estimated forecast of
product demand. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Equipment
acquired under capital leases is recorded at the present value
of the minimum lease payments required during the lease period.
Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the
useful lives of property, plant and equipment are capitalized.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense
as incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the
cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from
the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in
earnings. 43 Table of Contents MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSCONTINUED Tables in thousands, except share and per share data Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of twenty to thirty-one and one-half
years for buildings and three to seven years for machinery and
equipment and furniture and fixtures and office equipment, which
includes ERP software. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of
the leased asset. Intangible Assets Intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are
estimated by management based on the fair value of assets
acquired. These include acquired customer lists, technology,
patents, trade name and covenants not to compete. Intangible
assets are amortized from three to eight years on a
straight-line basis which represents the estimated periods of
benefit. Goodwill Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of acquired net assets
exceeded the fair value of those net assets on the date of
acquisition. The Company assesses goodwill for impairment on an
annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or
more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating
that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of
a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value
of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If
the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value,
an impairment loss is recorded equal to that excess. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived
assets which include acquired amortizable intangible assets, in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets SFAS144.
SFAS144 requires recognition of impairment of long-lived
assets in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds
the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets.
If an impairment is indicated, the assets are written down to
their estimated fair value. Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and
consist mainly of compensation related expenses and project
materials. The Companys research and development efforts
include numerous projects which generally have a duration of 12
to 30months. In-Process Research and Development The Company values tangible and intangible assets acquired
through its business acquisitions at fair value including
in-process research and development IPRD. The
Company determines IPRD through established valuation
techniques for various projects for the development of new
products and technologies and expenses IPRD when technical
feasibility is not reached. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs
were immaterial in 2005, 2004 and 2003. Income Taxes The Company records income taxes using the asset and liability
method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax
bases, and 44 Table of Contents MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSCONTINUED Tables in thousands, except share and per share data operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company
evaluates the realizability of its net deferred tax assets and
assesses the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly
basis. The future benefit to be derived from its deferred tax
assets is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient
future taxable income to realize the assets. The Company records
a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to
the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. To the
extent the Company establishes a valuation allowance, an expense
will be recorded within the provision for income taxes line on
the statement of operations. During the year ended
December31, 2002 the Company established a full valuation
allowance for its net deferred tax assets. In periods subsequent
to establishing a valuation allowance, if the Company were to
determine that it would be able to realize its net deferred tax
assets in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to
the valuation allowance would be recorded as a reduction to
income tax expense in the period such determination was made.
During the fourth quarter of 2004, after examining a number of
factors, including historical results and near term earnings
projections, the Company determined that it was more likely than
not that it would realize all of its net deferred tax assets,
except for those related to certain state tax credits and
adjusted the valuation allowance at December31, 2004. On October22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
the Act was signed into law. The Act contains a
provision allowing U.S.multinational companies a one-time
incentive to repatriate foreign earnings at an effective tax
rate of 525%. During 2005, the Company conducted an extensive
study of the new provision and concluded that no opportunities
existed from which the Company could benefit from repatriation
of its undistributed foreign earnings. Through December31,
2005, the Company has not provided deferred U.S.income
taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries
because such earnings were intended to be permanently reinvested
outside the U.S.Determination of the potential deferred
income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not
practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on
circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs. At
December31, 2005, the Company had $80,173,000 of
undistributed earnings in its foreign subsidiaries. New Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No154, Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No20,
Accounting Changes and FASB Statement No3, Reporting
Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements
SFAS154. SFAS154 provides guidance on
the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error
corrections. It establishes, unless impracticable, retrospective
application as the required method for reporting a change in
accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition
requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle.
SFAS154 also provides guidance for determining whether
retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is
impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective
application is impracticable. The provisions of this Statement
are effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors
made in fiscal periods beginning after December15, 2005.
The adoption of the provisions of SFAS154 is not expected
to have a material impact on the Companys financial
position or results of operations. In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No151, Inventory Costs
SFAS151. SFAS151 amends ARB
No43, Chapter4, Inventory Pricing. This
statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material,
and requires those items be recognized as current period charges
regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so
abnormal. In addition, this statement requires that
allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of
conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. SFAS151 is effective for inventory costs
incurred during fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005.
The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of
SFAS151. 45 Table of Contents MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSCONTINUED Tables in thousands, except share and per share data Use of Estimates The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis,
management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including
those related to revenue recognition, inventory, intangible
assets, goodwill, and other long-lived assets, in-process
research and development, merger expenses, income taxes and
investments. Management bases its estimates and judgments on
historical experience and on various other factors that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to be
consistent with the current year classifications. 3 Financial Instruments and Risk Management Foreign Exchange Risk Management The Company hedges a portion of its forecasted foreign currency
denominated intercompany sales of inventory, over a maximum
period of fifteen months, using forward exchange contracts
primarily related to Japanese and European currencies. These
derivatives are designated as cash-flow hedges, and changes in
their fair value are carried in accumulated other comprehensive
income until the hedged transaction affects earnings. When the
hedged transaction affects earnings, the appropriate gain or
loss from the derivative designated as a hedge of the
transaction is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive
income to cost of sales. As of December31, 2005, the
amount that will be reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income to cost of sales over the next twelve
months is an unrealized gain of $829,000, net of taxes. The
ineffective portion of the derivatives is recorded in cost of
sales and was immaterial in 2005, 2004 and 2003. The Company hedges certain intercompany and other payables with
forward foreign exchange contracts forward exchange
contracts. Since these derivatives hedge existing amounts
that are denominated in foreign currencies, the derivatives do
not qualify for hedge accounting under SFASNo133.
The foreign exchange gain or loss on these derivatives was
immaterial in 2005, 2004 and 2003. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on forward exchange
contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are
recognized immediately in earnings. The cash flows resulting
from forward exchange contracts that qualify for hedge
accounting are classified in the consolidated statement of cash
flows as part of cash flows from operating activities. Cash
flows resulting from forward exchange contracts that do not
qualify for hedge accounting are classified in the consolidated
statement of cash flows as investing activities. The Company
does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
trading purposes. There were forward exchange contracts with notional amounts
totaling $35,299,000 outstanding at December31, 2005. Of
such forward exchange contracts, $28,461,000 were outstanding to
exchange Japaneseyen for US dollars. There were forward
exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $26,301,000
outstanding at December31, 2004. Of such forward exchange
contracts, $21,550,000 were outstanding to exchange Japanese yen
for US dollars. There were forward exchange contracts with
notional amounts totaling $41,018,000 outstanding at
December31, 2003 of which $32,488,000 were outstanding to
exchange Japanese yen for U.S.dollars. 46 Table of Contents MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSCONTINUED Tables in thousands, except share and per share data Gains and losses on forward exchange contracts that qualify for
hedge accounting are classified in cost of goods sold and
totaled a gain of $812,000 for the year ended December31,
2005 and a loss of $1,666,000 and $1,411,000 for the years ended
December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The fair values of forward exchange contracts at
December31, 2005 and 2004, determined by applying period
end currency exchange rates to the notional contract amounts,
amounted to an unrealized gain of $1,237,000 and an unrealized
loss of $1,479,000, respectively. Concentrations of Credit Risk The Companys significant concentrations of credit risk
consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, investments,
forward exchange contracts and trade accounts receivable. The
Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with financial
institutions including some banks with which it has borrowings.
The Company maintains investments primarily in
U.S.Treasury and government agency securities and
corporate debt securities, rated AA or higher. The Company
enters into forward currency contracts with high credit-quality
financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk
exposure. The Companys customers are primarily
concentrated in the semiconductor industry, and a limited number
of customers account for a significant portion of the
Companys revenues. The Company regularly monitors the
creditworthiness of its customers and believes it has adequately
provided for potential credit loss exposures. Credit is extended
for all customers based primarily on financial condition and
collateral is not required. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair value of the term loans, including the current portion,
approximates its carrying value given its variable rate interest
provisions. The fair value of marketable securities is based on
quoted market prices. The fair value of mortgage notes is based
on borrowing rates for similar instruments and, therefore,
approximates its carrying value. For all other balance sheet
financial instruments, the carrying amount approximates fair
value because of the short period to maturity of these
instruments. 4Inventories Inventories consist of the following

short-term LIBOR based loan agreement with a bank to be utilized
primarily by its Japanese subsidiary for short-term liquidity
purposes. The credit line, which expires on July31, 2006,
provides for the Company to borrow in multiple currencies of up
to an equivalent of $35,000,000 U.S.dollars. At
December31, 2005, the Company had outstanding borrowings
of $11,028,000 U.S.dollars, payable on demand, at an
interest rate of 131%. Additionally, the Companys Japanese subsidiary has lines
of credit and short-term borrowing arrangements with one
financial institution which provide for aggregate borrowings as
of December31, 2005 of up to $12,725,000, which generally
expire and are renewed at three month intervals. At
December31, 2005 and 2004, total borrowings outstanding
under these arrangements were $5,938,000 and $7,790,000,
respectively, at interest rates ranging from 121% to 124% at

In connection with an acquisition in 2002, the Company assumed a
long-term debt agreement with the County of Monroe Industrial
Development Agency COMIDAfor a manufacturing facility
located in 48 Table of Contents MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSCONTINUED Tables in thousands, except share and per share data Rochester, New York. The terms are the same as that of the
underlying Industrial Development Revenue Bond which calls for
payments of interest only through July1, 2014, at which
time the Bond is repayable in a lump sum of $5,000,000. Interest
is reset annually based on bond remarketing, with an option by
the Company to elect a fixed rate, subject to a maximum rate of
13%per annum. At December31, 2005 the interest rate
was 3%. The bond is collateralized by the building. The
remaining principal balance outstanding at December31,
2005 was $5,000,000. The net book value of the building at
December31, 2005 was approximately $10,075,000. On March6, 2000, the Company entered into a mortgage note
payable with a bank to borrow $10,000,000 to finance the
purchase of land and a building. Principal and interest of
$119,000 is being paid in monthly installments with final
payments due in March 2007. The remaining principal as of
December31, 2005 was $1,667,000 with a variable interest
rate of 555%. The net book value of the land and building,
including improvements, at December31, 2005 was
approximately $17,474,000. In connection with the purchase of Telvac Engineering, Ltd., the
Company issued term loans of $752,000. Principal payments of
$61,000 were due on an annual basis through December1,
2004 and the remaining principal was paid in full in 2005. The Company had an outstanding term loan from a foreign bank,
with principal due on April2, 2004. This loan was paid in
full in 2004. Aggregate maturities of long-term debt over the next five years

7 Commitments and Contingencies On April3, 2003, Advanced Energy Industries, Inc.
Advanced Energy filed suit against MKS in federal
district court in Colorado Colorado Action,
seeking a declaratory judgment that Advanced Energys
Xstream product does not infringe three patents held by
MKS subsidiary, Applied Science and Technology, Inc.
ASTeX. On May14, 2003, MKS brought suit in
federal district court in Delaware against Advanced Energy for
infringement of five ASTeX patents, including the three patents
at issue in the Colorado Action. MKS sought injunctive relief
and damages for Advanced Energys infringement. On
December24, 2003, the Colorado court transferred Advanced
Energys Colorado Action to Delaware. In connection with
the jury trial, the parties agreed to present the jury with
representative claims from three of the five ASTeX patents. On
July23, 2004, the jury found that Advanced Energy
infringed all three patents. On October3, 2005, MKS and
Advanced Energy entered into a settlement agreement, pursuant to
which Advanced Energy paid MKS $3,000,000 in cash in October
2005. The settlement agreement also provided that Advanced
Energy would not make, use, sell or offer to sell its Rapid,
Rapid FE, Rapid OE and Xstream products or related products in
the United States or any other country in which MKS held a
relevant patent or had pending a patent application on the date
of the settlement agreement, during the life of any such patent 49 Table of Contents MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSCONTINUED Tables in thousands, except share and per share data or resulting patent, in the case of patent applications. On
October6, 2005, the federal district court in Delaware
issued a final judgment of infringement and an injunction
prohibiting Advanced Energy from making, using, selling,
offering to sell, or importing into the United States such
products. On November3, 1999, On-Line Technologies, Inc.
On-Line, which MKS acquired in 2001, brought suit
in federal district court in Connecticut against Perkin-Elmer,
Inc. and certain other defendants for infringement of
On-Lines patent related to its FTIR spectrometer product
and related claims. The suit sought injunctive relief and
damages for infringement. Perkin-Elmer, Inc. filed a
counterclaim seeking invalidity of the patent, costs and
attorneys fees. In June 2002, the defendants filed a
motion for summary judgment. In April 2003, the court granted
the motion and dismissed the case. MKS appealed this decision to
the federal circuit court of appeals. On October13, 2004,
the federal circuit court of appeals reversed the lower
courts dismissal of certain claims in the case.
Accordingly, the case has been remanded to the United States
District Court in Connecticut for further proceedings on the
merits of the remaining claims. On March11, 2005,
Perkin-Elmer, Inc. submitted to the court a stipulation that it
infringed a specified claim of On-Lines patent and filed a
motion for summary judgment that such patent claim is invalid.
On April6, 2005, MKS filed a reply to the summary judgment
motion. The parties are awaiting the courts response to
the motion. The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims,
which have arisen in the ordinary course of business. In the
opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters
will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys
results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The Company leases certain of its facilities and machinery and
equipment under capital and operating leases expiring in various
years through 2010 and thereafter. Generally, the facility
leases require the Company to pay maintenance, insurance and
real estate taxes. Rental expense under operating leases totaled
$7,439,000, $8,344,000 and $7,253,000, for the years ended
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Minimum lease payments under operating leases are as follows

As of December31, 2005, the Company has entered into
non-cancelable purchase commitments for certain inventory
components and other equipment and services used in its normal
operations. The majority of these purchase commitments covered
by these arrangements are for periods of less than one year and
aggregate to approximately $69,835,000. Additionally, the
Company has engaged a third party to provide certain computer
equipment, IT network services and IT support. This contract is
for a period of approximately six years beginning in September
2004 and has a significant penalty for early termination. The 50 Table of Contents MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSCONTINUED Tables in thousands, except share and per share data obligation of approximately $26,000,000, excluding capital lease
and interest payments of $1,519,000, will be paid over the term
of the arrangement. Average annual payments are expected to be
approximately $5,200,000. To the extent permitted by Massachusetts law, the Companys
Restated Articles of Organization, as amended, require the
Company to indemnify any of its current or former officers or
directors or any person who has served or is serving in any
capacity with respect to any of the Companys employee
benefit plans. Because no claim for indemnification has been
pursued by any person covered by the relevant provisions of the
Companys Restated Articles of Organization, the Company
believes that the estimated exposure for these indemnification
obligations is currently minimal. Accordingly, the Company has
no liabilities recorded for these requirements as of
December31, 2005. The Company also enters into agreements in the ordinary course
of business which include indemnification provisions. Pursuant
to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and
agrees to reimburse the indemnified party, generally its
customers, for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified
party in connection with certain patent or other intellectual
property infringement claims, and, in some instances, other
claims, by any third party with respect to the Companys
products. The term of these indemnification obligations is
generally perpetual after execution of the agreement. The
maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be
required to make under these indemnification agreements is, in
some instances, unlimited. The Company has never incurred costs
to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these
indemnification obligations. As a result, the Company believes
the estimated fair value of these obligations is minimal.
Accordingly, the Company has no liabilities recorded for these
obligations as of December31, 2005. When, as part of an acquisition, the Company acquires all of the
stock or all of the assets and liabilities of another company,
the Company assumes liability for certain events or occurrences
that took place prior to the date of acquisition. The maximum
potential amount of future payments the Company could be
required to make for such obligations is undeterminable at this
time. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time
of the acquisitions, historically the Company has not made
significant payments for these indemnifications. Accordingly, no
liabilities have been recorded for these obligations. In conjunction with certain asset sales, the Company may provide
routine indemnifications whose terms range in duration and often
are not explicitly defined. Where appropriate, an obligation for
such indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Because the
amounts of liability under these types of indemnifications are
not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of the
obligation under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably
estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the
time of the asset sale, historically the Company has not made
significant payments for these indemnifications. 8 Stockholders Equity Issuance of Common Stock On January21, 2004, the Company issued
1,142,857shares of its common stock at $2625per
share through a public offering. Proceeds of the offering, net
of underwriters discount and offering expenses, were
$28,251,000. On January23, 2004, the underwriters
exercised their over-allotment option and therefore, the Company
issued an additional 171,429shares of its common stock,
which generated net proceeds of $4,298,000. Stock Purchase Plans The Companys Third Amended and Restated 1999 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan authorizes
the issuance of up to an aggregate of 1,250,000shares of
Common Stock to participating 51 Table of Contents MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSCONTINUED Tables in thousands, except share and per share data employees. Offerings under the Purchase Plan commence on
June1 and December1 and terminate, respectively, on
November30 and May31. Under the Purchase Plan,
eligible employees may purchase shares of Common Stock through
payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation. The price
at which an employees option is exercised is the lower of
185% of the closing price of the Common Stock on the
Nasdaq National Market on the day that each offering commences
or 285% of the closing price on the day that each
offering terminates. During 2005 and 2004 the Company issued
113,525 and 100,867shares, respectively, of Common Stock
to employees who participated in the Purchase Plan at exercise
prices of $1419 and $1427 in 2005 and $1986 and $1444 in
2004. As of December31, 2005 there were
592,087shares reserved for future issuance under the
Purchase Plan. The Companys Second Amended and Restated International
Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Foreign Purchase
Plan authorizes the issuance of up to an aggregate of
250,000shares of Common Stock to participating employees.
Offerings under the Foreign Purchase Plan commence on
June1 and December1 and terminate, respectively, on
November30 and May31. Under the Foreign Purchase
Plan, eligible employees may purchase shares of Common Stock
through payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation.
The price at which an employees option is exercised is the
lower of 185% of the closing price of the Common Stock
on the Nasdaq National Market on the day that each offering
commences or 285% of the closing price on the day that
each offering terminates. During 2005 and 2004, the Company
issued 24,933 and 21,786shares of Common Stock to
employees who participated in the Foreign Purchase Plan at
exercise prices of $1419 and $1427 and $1986 and
$1444per share, respectively. As of December31,
2005 there were 138,456shares reserved for future issuance
under the Foreign Purchase Plan. Stock Option Plans The Companys 2004 Stock Incentive Plan the 2004
Plan was adopted by the board of directors on
March4, 2004 and approved by the stockholders on
May13, 2004. As of December31, 2005, there were
2,691,955shares authorized for issuance under the 2004
Plan, which amount shall increase each year by an amount equal
to 5% of the total outstanding shares of the Companys
common stock outstanding on January 1 of such year, provided
that the maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock
which may be issued under the 2004 Plan is
15,000,000shares subject to adjustment for certain
changes in MKS capitalization. The Company may grant
options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights and
other stock-based awards to employees, officers, directors,
consultants and advisors under the 2004 Plan. As of
December31, 2005 there were 2,599,955shares
available for future grant under the 2004 Plan. The Companys Second Restated 1995 Stock Incentive Plan
the 1995 Plan authorized, as of December31,
2005, 15,000,000shares of common stock for issuance
thereunder. Pursuant to the terms of the 1995 Plan, the number
of shares available for issuance under the 1995 Plan was
increased annually by an amount equal to 5% of the total
outstanding shares of the Companys common stock
outstanding on January 1 of such year, provided that the maximum
aggregate number of common stock which could be issued under the
1995 Plan was 15,000,000shares subject to adjustment for
certain changes in MKS capitalization. Pursuant to the
1995 Plan, the Company could grant options, restricted stock or
other stock-based awards to employees, officers, directors,
consultants and advisors. The 1995 Plan expired in November 2005
and no further awards may be granted under the 1995 Plan,
although there are still outstanding options available for
exercise under this plan. The Companys 1997Director Stock Plan the
1997Director Plan provides for ithe
initial grant of options to purchase20,000shares of
common stock to each person who first becomes an outside
director and iiannual grants of options to
purchase12,000shares of common stock on the date of
the annual meeting of stockholders. In December 2004, the board
of directors amended the 1997Director Plan to allow for
all options granted on or after May17, 2000 to be
exercisable within the three year period from the date of the 52 Table of Contents MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSCONTINUED Tables in thousands, except share and per share data directors termination as director. On March4, 2004,
the board of directors approved, and on May13, 2004, the
stockholders approved, an increase in the number of shares
available for issuance under the 1997Director Plan from
300,000shares to 750,000shares. As of
December31, 2005 there were 415,500shares available
for future grant under the 1997Director Plan. On January7, 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of
outstanding options with an exercise price of $2300 or greater.
As a result of this action, options to purchase approximately
16million shares became exercisable on January7,
2005. No compensation expense was recorded in 2005 related to
this action as these options had no intrinsic value on
January7, 2005. Under the recently issued SFAS123R,
the Company will be required to apply the expense recognition
provisions under SFAS123R beginning in the first quarter
of 2006. The reason that the Company accelerated the vesting of
the identified stock options was to reduce the Companys
compensation charge in periods subsequent to the adoption of
SFAS123R. The Company has granted options to employees under the 2004
Plan, 1995 Plan and the 1993 Stock Option Plan and to directors
under the 1997Director Plan and the 1996Director
Stock Option Plan collectively, the Plans. The
Plans are administered by the compensation committee of the
Companys board of directors. At December31, 2005, 3,015,455shares of the
Companys common stock were available for future grants
under the Plans. Stock options are granted at an exercise price
equal to 100% of the fair value of the Companys common
stock. Generally, stock options granted to employees under the
Plans between 2001 and 2005 vest 25% after one year and
625%per quarter thereafter and expire 10years after
the grant date. Generally, stock options granted under the Plans
prior to 2000 vest 20% after one year and 5%per quarter
thereafter, and expire 10years after the grant date.
Generally, options granted to directors vest at the earliest of
1the next annual meeting, 213months from
date of grant, or 3the effective date of an acquisition. The following table presents the activity for options under the

At December31, 2005, the Company had federal net operating
loss carryforwards of $836,000, the utilization of which are
limited by the change in ownership rules under Section382
of the Internal Revenue Code Section382. The
Company also had federal general business, foreign tax and
minimum tax credit carryforwards credit
carryforwards of $576,000, $289,000 and $1,053,000,
respectively. The federal net operating losses, foreign tax and
general business credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2021,
2013 and 2025, respectively. Under the provisions of
Section382, certain substantial changes in the
Companys ownership may result in a limitation on the
amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards that can
be used in future periods. Although the Company believes that its tax positions are
consistent with applicable U.S.federal and state and
international laws, certain tax reserves are maintained at
December31, 2005 should these positions be challenged by
the applicable tax authority and additional tax assessed on
audit. During 2005, the Internal Revenue Service
IRS completed its examination of the
Companys tax returns for the tax years 1999 through 2002.
As a result of this examination, during the year ended
December31, 2005, the Company recorded a reduction in this
reserve of $1,621,000, a benefit to income tax expense of
$1,901,000 and a $576,000 reduction of goodwill related to a
previous acquisition. The change in the valuation allowance of $627,000 for the year
ended December31, 2005 resulted from an increase in state
tax credit carryovers for which the Company determined that it
is more likely than not that they will not be realized. The Company incurred significant operating losses in fiscal
2003, 2002 and 2001. At December31, 2003 a $22,293,000
valuation allowance was maintained against the Companys
net deferred tax assets. This valuation allowance was maintained
because the Company determined that it was more likely than not
that all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized. During the year ended December31, 2004, after examining a
number of factors, including historical results and near term
earnings projections, the Company determined that it was more
likely than not that it would realize all of its net deferred
tax assets, except for those related to certain state tax
credits. 56 Table of Contents MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSCONTINUED Tables in thousands, except share and per share data As a result of this analysis the Company reduced its valuation
allowance by $20,063,000 at December31, 2004 resulting in
a net deferred tax asset of $14,313,000. Of the total tax
benefit from the reversal of the valuation allowance, $3,850,000
was recorded as a reduction of goodwill and $5,271,000 was
recorded to additional paid-in capital for the tax benefit from
the exercise of stock options during both the current and prior
years. The remaining valuation allowance of $2,870,000 at
December31, 2005 relates to state tax credits for which it
is more likely than not that they will not be realized. Beginning in 2001, we were granted a tax holiday for our
manufacturing operations in Israel. This tax holiday resulted in
income tax savings of $1,190,000, $2,547,000 and $247,000 for
the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The tax holiday period expires at the end of 2010. On October22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
the Act was signed into law. The Act contains a
provision allowing U.S.multinational companies a one-time
incentive to repatriate foreign earnings at an effective tax
rate of 525%. During 2005, the Company conducted an extensive
study of the new provision and concluded that no opportunities
existed from which the Company could benefit from repatriation
of its undistributed foreign earnings. Through December31,
2005, the Company has not provided deferred income taxes on the
undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because such
earnings were intended to be permanently reinvested outside the
U.S.Determination of the potential deferred income tax
liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable
because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances
existing if and when remittance occurs. At December31,
2005 the Company had $80,173,000 of undistributed earnings in
its foreign subsidiaries. 10 Employee Benefit Plans The Company has a 401k profit-sharing plan for
U.S.employees meeting certain requirements in which
eligible employees may contribute between 1% and 20% of their
annual compensation to this plan, and, with respect to employees
who are age50 and older, certain specified additional
amounts, limited by an annual maximum amount determined by the
Internal Revenue Service. The Company, at its discretion, may
provide a matching contribution which will generally match up to
the first 2% of each participants compensation, plus 25%
of the next 4% of compensation. At the discretion of the board
of directors, the Company may also make additional contributions
for the benefit of all eligible employees. The Companys
contributions were $1,655,000, $1,685,000 and $1,503,000 for
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company maintains a bonus plan which provides cash awards to
key employees, at the discretion of the compensation committee
of the board of directors, based upon operating results and
employee performance. The bonus expense was $2,402,000 in 2005 4,617,000 in 2004 and was immaterial in 2003. The Company provides supplemental retirement benefits for
certain of its officers and executive officers. This obligation
was not material at December31, 2005 and at
December31, 2004. 11 Segment and Geographical Information and Significant
Customer The Company operates in one segment for the development,
manufacturing, sales and servicing of products that measure,
control, power and monitor critical parameters of advanced
manufacturing processes. The Companys chief decision-maker
reviews consolidated operating results to make decisions about
allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire
Company. 57 Table of Contents MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The Company had one customer comprising 18%, 20% and 18% of net
sales for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. During the years ended December31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, the Company estimates that approximately 71%, 74%
and 69% of its net sales, respectively, were to semiconductor
capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device
manufacturers. 12 Acquisitions On September30, 2003, the Company acquired Wenzel
Instruments, a privately held developer of solid state
MicroElectroMechanical System MEMSbased vacuum sensor
technology for advanced manufacturing processes. This
acquisition expands our vacuum gauge product line offering to
help meet current demand for process control sensors with higher
accuracy and a faster response in a smaller footprint. The
purchase price was $2,150,000 and was accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting. The purchase price was primarily
allocated to the assets acquired based upon their estimated fair
values, with the full purchase price being allocated to
intangible assets as completed technology. This intangible asset
is being amortized over its 58 Table of Contents MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSCONTINUED Tables in thousands, except share and per share data estimated useful life of 5years. The results of operations
are included in the Companys consolidated statement of
income as of and since the date of the purchase. Also, see Note19 Subsequent Events
Acquisitions. 13 Sale of Assets In August 2001, the Company sold certain assets for proceeds of
approximately $9,000,000, consisting of approximately $4,700,000
in cash, $3,900,000 in a note receivable and $200,000 of
warrants. The note receivable had an annual interest rate of
90% and was scheduled to mature on August7, 2004. The
loss on the transaction was $1,246,000 before taxes. During
2002, due to the downturn in the semiconductor industry and its
result on the acquirers operations, and the
acquirers inability to raise financing, the Company
considered the value of the note and warrants to be impaired.
Accordingly, during 2002, MKS recorded a charge of $4,121,000 to
other expense for the Companys estimate of the impairment
on the note receivable and warrants. During 2004, the Company
received $5,042,000 related to the collection of the note
receivable and accrued interest and the cancellation of the
warrants. This amount was recorded as a gain and included in
other income. 14 Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges As a result of the Companys various acquisitions from 2000
through 2002 and the downturn in the semiconductor capital
equipment market which began in 2000, the Company had redundant
activities and excess manufacturing capacity and office space.
Therefore in 2002, and continuing through the first quarter of
2004, the Company implemented restructuring activities to
rationalize manufacturing operations and reduce operating
expenses. As a result of these actions, the Company recorded
restructuring and asset impairment charges of $2,726,000 in
2002. The charges consisted of $631,000 of severance costs
related to a workforce reduction, $1,228,000 related to
consolidation of leased facilities, and an asset impairment
charge of $867,000 primarily related to the impairment of an
intangible asset from the discontinuance of certain product
development activities. The fair value of the impaired
intangible asset was determined using the expected present value
of future cash flows. The workforce reduction was across all
functional groups and consisted of 225 employees. During 2003, the Company continued the consolidation it
initiated in 2002 related to various acquisitions, and recorded
restructuring, asset impairment and other charges of $1,593,000.
The charges in 2003 consisted of $356,000 of severance costs
related to workforce reductions, $1,145,000 of lease cost,
professional fees and other costs related to facility
consolidations and an asset impairment charge of $92,000. The
workforce reduction was across all functional groups. During 2004, the Company completed its enacted restructuring
activities related to the consolidation of operations from
acquired companies when it exited an additional leased facility
and recorded a restructuring charge of $437,000. During 2005, the Company initiated a restructuring plan related
to its Berlin, Germany location. This consolidation of
activities included the reduction of 16 employees. The total
restructuring charge related to this consolidation was $454,000,
which consisted of $251,000 related to the repayment of a
government grant and $203,000 in severance costs. Also during 2005, the Company terminated a lease related to a
facility previously exited. Prior to the lease being terminated,
the Company had an accrual of approximately $784,000 related to
this facility. After making the lease settlement payment and
payments for other contractual obligations, the remaining
balance of approximately $278,000 was reversed as there was no
remaining obligation. 59 Table of Contents MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The remaining facilities consolidation charges will be paid over
the remaining lease term, which ends in 2007. The accrual for
severance costs and lease payments are recorded in Other accrued
expenses and Other liabilities in the consolidated balance
sheets. 15 Goodwill and Intangible Assets The Company is required to perform an annual impairment test of
its goodwill under the provisions of SFAS142.
SFAS142 requires that companies identify and assess
goodwill at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are
defined as operating segments or one level below an operating
segment, referred to as a component. The Company has determined
that its reporting units are components of its operating
segment. The Company allocates goodwill to reporting units at
the time of acquisition and bases that allocation on which
reporting units will benefit from the acquired assets and
liabilities. The fair value of each reporting unit with goodwill
is compared to its recorded book value. An excess of book value
over fair value indicates that an impairment of goodwill exists.
Fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis of
expectations of future earnings for each of the reporting units
with goodwill. The Company completed its annual impairment test
for 2005 and 2004 and concluded that no impairment of goodwill
existed as of October31, 2005 or October31, 2004,
the annual goodwill measurement dates for 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the years
ended December31, 2005 and 2004 were as follows

16 Product Warranties The Company provides for the estimated costs to fulfill customer
warranty obligations upon the recognition of the related
revenue. While the Company engages in extensive product quality
programs and processes, including actively monitoring and
evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the
Companys warranty obligation is affected by product
failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, and supplier
warranties on parts delivered to the Company. Should actual
product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, or
supplier warranties on parts differ from the Companys
estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would
be required. Product warranty activity for the years ended December31,

Controls and Procedures Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures MKS management, with the participation of our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
December31, 2005. The term disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in
Rules13a-15e
and 15d-15e under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange
Act, means controls and other procedures of a 65 Table of Contents company that are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
companys management, including its principal executive and
principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment
in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of December31, 2005, our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as
of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective at the reasonable assurance level. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting The management of MKS is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
Internal control over financial reporting is defined in
Rules13a-15f
and 15d-15f
promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or
under the supervision of, the companys principal executive
and principal financial officers and effected by the
companys board of directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and includes those
policies and procedures that   
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company     
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company;and     
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005.
In making this assessment, MKS management used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSOin Internal
Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, management concluded that, as of
December31, 2005, our internal control over financial
reporting was effective based on those criteria. Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on
page34. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial
reporting as defined in
Rules13a-15f
and 15d-15f under the
Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended
December31, 2005 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. 66 Table of Contents
