68 Table of Contents INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
PanAmSat Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of PanAmSat Corporation and subsidiaries the
Company as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and
the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss, and
of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the index at a2.
These consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
consolidated financial statements and the financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of PanAmSat Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2003, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein. As discussed in Note2 to the consolidated
financial statements, in 2002 the Company changed its method of
accounting for goodwill to conform to Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No142. s/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP Stamford, Connecticut March5, 2004 69 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME Years Ended December31, 2003, 2002 and

73 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 1.Basis of
Presentation and Description of Business Basis of
Presentation Effective
May16, 1997, PanAmSat International Systems, Inc. then
operating under its previous name, PanAmSat Corporation and the
Galaxy Satellite Services division of Hughes Communications,
Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of General Motors Corporation
GM were merged the Merger. The
merged company was renamed PanAmSat Corporation. Hughes
Electronics Corporation Hughes Electronics
indirectly owns approximately 805% of our outstanding common
stock. Within these consolidated financial statements, in
addition to the company, the terms we,
us and our refer to PanAmSat Corporation
and its subsidiaries. On April9, 2003, GM, Hughes Electronics and
The News Corporation Limited News Corporation
announced the signing of definitive agreements that provided
for, among other things, the split-off of Hughes Electronics
from GM and the indirect acquisition by News Corporation of
approximately 34% of the outstanding capital stock of Hughes
Electronics the News Corporation Transactions.
These transactions were consummated on December22, 2003.
Upon completion of these transactions, News Corporation
transferred its interest in Hughes Electronics to its 82% owned
subsidiary, Fox Entertainment Group, Inc Fox
Entertainment. In February 2004, Hughes Electronics
announced its intent to focus on the direct-to-home satellite
businesses and that it has begun to evaluate how we fit into
that strategic vision. Hughes Electronics subsequently advised
us that it is considering strategic initiatives with regard to
its ownership interest in our company. Description of the
Business We are a
leading global facilities-based provider of video, broadcasting
and network services through satellites. We lease transponder
capacity on our satellites, which we own and operate, and
deliver entertainment and information to cable television
systems, television broadcast affiliates, direct-to-home
DTH television operators, Internet service
providers, telecommunications companies and other corporations
and governments. We also provide satellite services and related
technical support for live transmissions for news and special
events coverage. In addition, we provide satellite services to
telecommunications carriers, corporations and Internet service
providers ISPs for the provision of
satellite-based communications networks, including private
corporate networks employing very small aperture antennas and
international access to the U.S. Internet backbone. With 25 satellites in orbit we have one of the
worlds largest commercial geostationary earth orbit
satellite networks, capable of reaching over 98% of the
worlds population. We are one of only a few companies
worldwide capable of servicing a global footprint through an
owned fleet of satellites. We have one of the most sophisticated
ground infrastructure networks available to support the needs of
our customers. We have eight technical facilities in the U.S.,
which provide transmission, monitoring and control services for
operating our fleet and teleport and other services for our
customers. We lease such services outside of the United States
to support the remainder of our worldwide satellite fleet. 2.Significant
Accounting Policies Principles of
Consolidation The
consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those
of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Use of
Estimates The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect amounts reported therein. Due to the inherent
uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results
reported in future periods may be based upon amounts that differ
from those estimates. Revenue
Recognition We enter
into contracts to provide satellite capacity and related
services. Revenues are generated from outright sale, sales-type
lease and operating lease contracts with customers to 74 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued provide satellite transponders and transponder
capacity and, in certain cases, earth station and teleport
facilities, for periods typically ranging from one year to the
life of the satellite. Almost all contracts stipulate payment
terms in U.S. dollars. Pursuant to an outright sale contract, all rights
and title to a transponder are purchased. In connection with an
outright sale, we recognize the sale amount as revenue and the
cost basis of the transponder is charged to cost of outright
sales and sales-type leases. Lease contracts qualifying for capital lease
treatment typically based, among other factors, on the term of
the lease are accounted for as sales-type leases. For
sales-type lease transactions, we recognize as revenue the net
present value of the future minimum lease payments. The cost
basis of the transponder is charged to cost of outright sales
and sales-type leases. During the life of the lease, we
recognize as revenue in each respective period, that portion of
each periodic lease payment deemed to be attributable to
interest income. The balance of each periodic lease payment,
representing principal repayment, is recognized as a reduction
of the net investment in sales-type leases. Interest income from
sales-type leases of approximately $17million 20million and $22million is included in sales-type
lease revenues for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively. Lease contracts that do not qualify as sales-type
leases are accounted for as operating leases. Operating lease
revenues are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over
the lease term unless collectability is not reasonably assured
refer to Accounts Receivable below. Differences
between operating lease payments received and revenues
recognized are deferred as, or amortized from, operating lease
receivables. Revenues for occasional services are recognized as
services are performed and billed. We have certain obligations,
including providing spare or substitute capacity if available,
in the event of satellite service failure under certain
long-term agreements. If no spare or substitute capacity is
available, the agreements may be terminated. Except for certain
deposits, we are not obligated to refund operating lease
payments previously made. Sales-type lease agreements and contracts for the
sale of transponders typically include a telemetry, tracking and
control TTC service agreement with the
customer, which require the customer to pay monthly service fees
which are recognized and billable as the services are performed.
We also earn revenues for TTC services in relation to our
operating lease agreements with customers. Fees for such
services are either included in the customers monthly
lease payment or billed separately. We also record revenues related to equipment
sales to customers. These equipment sales represent equipment
purchased, constructed or developed on behalf of our customers.
We recognize revenue related to these equipment sales upon the
transfer to the customer of title to the equipment. During 2003, we entered into a long-term
construction arrangement with a customer to construct an L-Band
navigational payload on our Galaxy 1R replacement satellite
Galaxy 15. We recognize revenue utilizing the
percentage-of-completion accounting method for such long-term
construction contracts, which extend beyond one year. Revenue in
relation to these contracts is recognized based upon the
completion of pre-established milestones. The costs incurred to
meet these milestones are recognized upon the completion of each
milestone. Fair Value of Financial
Instruments The
carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values generally
due to the short maturity of these items. The carrying amount of
the net investment in sales-type leases approximates fair value
based on the interest rates implicit in the leases. At December31, 1997, in connection with our
debt refinancing activities, we entered into certain U.S.
Treasury rate lock contracts to reduce our exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates. The aggregate nominal value of
these contracts was $375million and these contracts were
accounted for as hedges because they 75 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued were applied to a specific refinancing plan that
was consummated shortly after December31, 1997. The cost
to unwind these instruments in 1998 was $91million and
this amount has been deferred and is being amortized to interest
expense over the terms of the related debt securities. Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities We account
for our derivative instrument and interest rate hedge under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities SFAS 133. SFAS 133 requires all
derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
SFAS 133 also establishes rules for hedging instruments which,
depending on the nature of the hedge, require that change in the
fair value of the derivatives either be offset against the
change in fair value of assets or liabilities through earnings,
or be recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged
item is recognized in earnings. We use derivative financial
instruments, including interest rate hedges to manage market
risks. We entered into a three-year interest rate hedge
agreement in relation to $100million of the outstanding
borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility during the
third quarter of 2002 See Note6, Long-Term
Debt. Concentration of Credit
Risk We provide
satellite transponders and related services and extends credit
to a large number of customers in the commercial satellite
communications market. Management monitors the exposure to
credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses
that are charged to selling, general and administrative
expenses. Revenues derived from affiliates of Hughes Electronics
and News Corporation comprised approximately 16% and 11 respectively, of total revenues in 2003. No other customers
provide us with revenues in excess of 10% of total revenues. Cash and Cash
Equivalents Cash and
cash equivalents consists of cash on hand and highly liquid
investments with maturities at date of acquisition of three
months or less. Supplemental cash flow information for 2003, 2002

Short-Term
Investments At
December31, 2003, we had short-term investments of
$389million versus $998million at
December31, 2002. The short-term investments primarily
consist of commercial paper with original maturities of up to
twelve months. All of the short-term investments held as of
December31, 2003 have remaining maturities of three months
or less. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No115, Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities, we have classified these
short-term investments as available-for-sale. These securities
are carried at estimated fair market value. The aggregate
unrealized gains and losses related to these investments, net of
taxes, are reflected as a part of other comprehensive income
within stockholders equity. Accounts
Receivable Accounts
receivable include amounts earned under service agreements and
occasional services which are billable as performed. An
allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained in the amount of
approximately $64million and $87million at
December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. If collectability
of the receivable is not reasonably assured at the time services
are performed, we do not initially record the revenue, but
rather records an allowance for customer credits to offset the
receivable. If there is a change in the customers
financial status or the receivable is collected, revenue is
recorded at that time. During the years ended December31,
2003 and 2002, we recorded $51million and
$115million, respectively, of net customer credits. The
total allowance for customer credits was $181million and
$130million as of December31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. 76 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Satellites and Other Property and
Equipment Satellites
and other property and equipment are stated at historical cost,
or in the case of certain satellites acquired in connection with
the Merger, the fair value at the date of acquisition. The
capitalized cost of satellites includes all construction costs,
incentive obligations, launch costs, launch insurance, and
capitalized interest. Substantially all other property and
equipment consists of our teleport facilities. Depreciation and amortization are provided using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
respective assets as follows   
Estimated Lives

Satellite systems under construction
Satellites in service
12-15
Communications equipment
3-7
General support equipment
5-10
Buildings
25
Leasehold improvements
3-18
The estimated useful lives of our satellites are
based upon the lower of the satellites design life or the
estimated life of the satellite as determined by an engineering
analysis performed during initial in-orbit testing. As the
telecommunications industry is subject to rapid technological
change and our satellites have been subject to certain health
related anomalies, we may be required to revise the estimated
useful lives of our satellites and communications equipment or
to adjust their carrying amounts. Accordingly, the estimated
useful lives of our satellites are periodically reviewed using
current engineering data. If a significant change in the
estimated useful lives of our satellites is identified, we
account for the effects of such changes on depreciation expense
on a prospective basis. Reductions in the estimated useful lives
of our satellites would result in additional depreciation
expense in future periods. If the reduction in the estimated
useful life of a satellite results in undiscounted future cash
flows for the satellite, which are less than the carrying value
of the satellite, an impairment charge would be recorded. Deferred Charges and Other

Long-Term Receivables -
net Our long-term
receivables primarily represent receivables with payment terms
extending beyond one year and receivables from operating leases
with escalating payment terms that are recognized on a
straight-line basis into revenue over the lease term.
Differences between operating lease payments received and
revenues recognized are deferred as, or amortized from,
operating lease receivables. These long-term receivables are net
of an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately
$49million and $36million as of December31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. Customer Incentive Programs -
net Deferred charges
related to customer incentive programs are amortized against
revenue over the terms of the respective customer contracts.
Deferred charges related to 77 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued customer contracts were $330million and
$320million at December31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. These costs primarily represent the cost of
antennas provided to cable operators without charge pursuant to
certain customer contractual arrangements as well as certain
other contractual costs incurred by us in order to secure
customer leases. These costs are being amortized against the
related revenue recorded pursuant to the terms of the contracts
and the accumulated amortization at December31, 2003 and
2002 amounted to $70million and $46million,
respectively. Debt Issuance Costs -
net Debt issuance costs of
$539 and $631million as of December31, 2003 and
2002, respectively, represent costs incurred by us to secure
debt financing. These costs are being amortized to interest
expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the related
indebtedness and the accumulated amortization at
December31, 2003 and 2002 amounted to $286million
and $229million, respectively. Debt issuance costs
capitalized in 2003 and 2002 were $15million and
$414million, respectively. Included in interest expense
during 2003 and 2002 were approximately $107million and
$33million, respectively, associated with the write-offs
of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the prepayments of
portions of the Senior Secured Credit Facility in 2003 and the
2002 Refinancing See Note 6 Long-term Debt. Other Assets -
net Our Other Assets
consists of prepayments of installation costs associated with
TTC satellite services to third parties that are amortized
over the respective contract periods as well as other
miscellaneous deferred charges and other assets. Included in
other assets net as of December31, 2003 are
$32million of customer lists. As of December31,
2003 and 2002 customer lists are net of accumulated amortization
of $06million and $0, respectively See
Identifiable Intangible Assets below. Prepaid
Insurance We amortize
prepaid insurance costs to expense over the terms of the
respective insurance policies. Investments
We have investments in certain equity securities, which
represent less than a 10% ownership interest. These investments
are accounted for by us under the cost method and are carried at
the lower of cost or market. Our investments were
$37million and $55million at December31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. Goodwill
We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No142 SFAS142 effective
January1, 2002. Pursuant to SFAS142, we discontinued
the amortization of goodwill beginning January1, 2002.
SFAS142 also requires at least an annual assessment of
recorded goodwill for impairment. The initial annual impairment
test had to be completed by December31, 2002. Any
impairment charges resulting from an annual impairment test
would be recorded in operating results. We have established the
fourth quarter of each year as the timeframe for annual
impairment assessment. No impairment charges were required to be
recorded in 2003 or 2002 as a result of these assessments See
Note5 Goodwill. Identifiable Intangible
Assets We amortize
identifiable intangible assets such as customer lists using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging
from 6 to 36months. Amortization expense for identifiable
intangible assets was $06million for 2003 and $0 for both
2002 and 2001 See Deferred Charges and Other Assets -
Net, above. These customer lists were acquired in
conjunction with our 2003 purchases of Esatel Communications,
Inc., and Sonic Telecommunications International Ltd. See
Note8 Acquisitions. Evaluation of Long-Lived
Assets We periodically
evaluate potential impairment loss relating to long-lived assets
including satellites, when a change in circumstances occurs, by
assessing whether the unamortized carrying amount can be
recovered over the remaining life through undiscounted future
expected cash flows generated by the underlying assets
excluding interest payments. If the undiscounted future cash
flows were less than the carrying value of the asset, an
impairment charge would be recorded. 78 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued The impairment charge would be measured as the
excess of the carrying value of the asset over the present value
of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate
commensurate with the risks involved. In the event a portion of a satellite was
rendered inoperative and/or incapable of performing its intended
function, we would apply the concepts of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No144 Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets
SFAS144, in the determination of whether an
impairment loss had occurred. If an impairment loss was
indicated, such amount would be recognized in the period of
occurrence, net of any insurance proceeds to be received so long
as such amounts are determinable and receipt is probable. If no
impairment loss was indicated in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement
No144 and we received insurance proceeds, the proceeds
would offset the carrying value of the satellite. In the event
that the insurance proceeds received exceeded the carrying value
of the satellite, the excess of the proceeds over the carrying
value of the satellite would be recognized in the income
statement. In the event a portion of a satellite was
rendered inoperative and/or incapable of performing its intended
function and the satellite was not insured, we would apply the
concepts of SFAS144 in the determination of whether an
impairment loss had occurred. In the event an impairment loss
had occurred, such amount would be recognized in the period of
occurrence. Deferred
Revenues We enter into
agreements with our customers under which they make prepayments
for services to be rendered over a specific period. Payments
received are deferred and amortized over the periods of
performance. Transponder
Insurance We accrue an
obligation for the present value of estimated in-orbit
performance insurance costs on transponder sales, sales-type
leases and other agreements with performance warranty
provisions, concurrently with the recognition of the related
revenue. We also purchase insurance for certain of our owned
satellites for all or some portion of the satellites book
value See Note12 Commitments and
Contingencies. Premiums paid relative to such insurance
are amortized to expense over the insurance policy terms, which
are typically one to five years. Other Comprehensive Income
Loss Other
comprehensive income loss refers to revenues, expenses, gains
and losses that under accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America are included in other
comprehensive income loss but are excluded from net income
loss as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment
to stockholders equity, net of tax. Our other
comprehensive income loss is composed of unrealized gains and
losses on available-for-sale securities, unrealized losses on
our cash flow hedge, and foreign currency translation
adjustments. Foreign Currency
Translation Assets and
liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries, where the functional
currency is the local currency, are translated into
U.S.dollars using year-end exchange rates. Revenues and
expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average
exchange rates in effect during the year. Adjustments resulting
from financial statement translations are included as a
component of stockholders equity. Gains and losses
resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded within
the income statement when recognized. Income
Taxes The provision
for income taxes is based upon reported income before income
taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the
impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets
and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and
such amounts recognized for tax purposes, as measured by
applying currently enacted tax rates. Beginning in 1998 through December22, 2003,
we and our subsidiaries joined with Hughes Electronics and GM in
filing a consolidated U.S.Federal income tax return. On
December22, 2003, Hughes Electronics split-off from GM and
as a result Hughes Electronics no longer files a
U.S.federal 79 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued income tax return with GM. We will continue to
file a consolidated U.S.federal income tax return with
Hughes Electronics which will file a U.S.federal income
tax return as a separate consolidated group. Under the tax
sharing agreements with Hughes Electronics, the portion of the
Hughes Electronics consolidated tax amounts recorded by us
is generally equivalent to the amounts we would have incurred on
a separate return basis. In accordance with such agreements, we
provide for current and deferred income taxes as if we were the
common parent of an affiliated group that is not included in the
consolidated federal income tax return that includes Hughes
Electronics. At December31, 2003, our balance sheet
reflected a deferred tax asset in the amount of
$1520million, net of a valuation allowance, attributable
to the future benefit from the utilization of certain net
operating tax loss carryforwards, alternative minimum tax
credits and foreign tax credits. Our tax sharing agreements with Hughes
Electronics do not provide for the payment by either Hughes
Electronics or us, upon our separation from Hughes
Electronics consolidated return group, for any benefit
relating to any of our tax attributes at such time. Absent
amending the existing agreements to the contrary, the
parties obligations under the tax sharing agreements
through the date of separation will be based on the pro forma
tax returns required by such agreements. Upon separation from
Hughes Electronics, our net operating loss carryforwards and
other tax attributes will be those shown on the tax returns that
were actually filed and our deferred tax assets will be
recomputed to reflect those attributes. The existing tax sharing
agreements do not address tax matters upon separation of the
companies. Since we make separate elections to treat items
differently under the tax sharing agreement than reported on the
actual tax returns, the tax bases in our satellites may increase
and our net operating losses and other tax attributes may
decrease in the event of separation. From the Merger date in 1997 and up to the date
upon which Hughes Electronics became our 805% shareholder, we
and our domestic subsidiaries filed a separate consolidated U.S.
Federal income tax return. Our income tax provision prior to 2003 included
estimates of potential tax expense for the possible reduction
upon the Internal Revenue Service IRS audit of the
tax benefits we derived from a deduction for the
Extraterritorial Income Exclusion ETIand its predecessor
regime the Foreign Sales Corporation as well as for the
potential tax expense that may arise from an adverse outcome
from our foreign tax withholding issues. For all years prior to
2003, we have assessed our minimum and maximum exposure for
Federal tax issues, including Foreign Sales Corporation and ETI
issues, as well as foreign tax withholding issues, and have
provided taxes in the amount of our estimated exposure. Various foreign governments have asserted that we
are subject to income withholding taxes on the revenue derived
from broadcasters who are outside their territory, broadcast
into their territory and remit payments directly to us in the
United States. We have vigorously contested these assertions
under all applicable U.S. and foreign tax laws. We provided
additional taxes in 2003 that substantially affected our
effective tax rate. We consider our reserves adequate for any
exposure we may have for potential income withholding taxes on
this broadcaster revenue. If we are unsuccessful in our defense
of any such claims, we could be exposed to a substantial cash
payment liability. Business Segment and Geographic
Information We operate
our business as a single operating segment, which provides video
and data network services to major broadcasting, DTH television
providers, telecommunications companies worldwide, ISPs and
governments. Substantially all of our operating 80 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Earnings Per
Share We report our
earnings per share in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No128, Earnings Per
Share. Our only dilutive securities are common stock
options and these options have no dilutive effect on the
earnings per share presented. The weighted average amount of
outstanding antidilutive common stock options excluded from the
computation of diluted earnings per share was 6,237,832,
6,588,333 and 3,658,407 for the years ended December31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Stock-Based
Compensation Effective
January1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition
provision of FASBStatement No123, Accounting
for Stock Based Compensation, prospectively, to all
employee awards granted on or after January1, 2003,
pursuant to FASBStatement No148, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and
Disclosure. Therefore, we recorded compensation expense
for employee stock options granted after December31, 2002,
but not in relation to previous awards granted. Awards granted
prior to January1, 2003 were accounted for in accordance
with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees See
Recent Accounting Pronouncements below. Recent Accounting
Pronouncements In
April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No145, Rescission of FASBStatements
No4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASBStatement
No13, and Technical Corrections
SFAS145. SFAS145 requires that a loss
on extinguishment of debt meet the requirements of APB30
to be treated as an extraordinary item in the statement of
operations. SFAS145 also amends FASBStatement
No13 to eliminate an inconsistency between the required
accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and the required
accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic
effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. In connection with the refinancing of the Hughes
Electronics term loan in the first quarter of 2002, we recorded
an extraordinary loss on the early extinguishment of debt as a
result of the write-off of the remaining related unamortized
debt issuance costs. Upon adoption of the provisions of
SFAS145 related to the rescission of FASBStatement
No4 on January1, 2003, we were required to
reclassify this loss on 81 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued extinguishment of debt, as it does not meet the
new requirements for classification as an extraordinary item in
accordance with SFAS145. As such, we reclassified
$33million to interest expense and recorded the related
income tax effect of $08million within income tax expense
for 2002. This reclassification had no effect on net income but
resulted in lower income before income taxes for these periods. In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No146, Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
SFAS146. This Statement addresses financial
accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or
disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force
EITFIssue No94-3, Liability Recognition for
Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring EITF94-3. This
Statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with
an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is
incurred. Whereas, under EITF94-3, a liability for an exit
cost was recognized at the date of an entitys commitment
to an exit plan. SFAS146 is to be applied prospectively to
exit or disposal activities initiated after December31,
2002. As such, we adopted the provisions of SFAS146
effective January1, 2003. These provisions did not have a
significant impact on our financial statements upon adoption.
However, the adoption of these provisions has affected the
timing of expense recognition on a prospective basis as compared
to when these expenses would have been recognized under
EITF94-3. Our restructuring reserves as of
December31, 2002 were all recorded pursuant to
EITF94-3 at the date of our commitment to the exit plans.
Beginning in 2003, we accounted for restructuring costs in
accordance with SFAS146, which requires that these
restructuring charges be recorded as the related liabilities are
incurred See Note11 Facilities Restructuring and
Severance Costs. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No148 Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation Transition and
Disclosure an amendment of SFAS123,
SFAS148 which is effective for financial
statements for fiscal years ending after December15, 2002,
with early adoption permitted. SFAS148 was issued to
provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change
to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation. We elected to adopt the expensing
provisions of SFAS123 utilizing the prospective method
beginning on January1, 2003. The following table
illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share as
if the fair value based method had been applied to all
outstanding and unvested awards in each period in thousands

STATEMENTS Continued In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation FIN No46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. In
December 2003, the FASB issued FINNo46 Revised to
address certain FIN46 implementation issues. This
interpretation clarifies the application of Accounting Research
Bulletin No51, Consolidated Financial Statements,
for companies that have interests in entities that are Variable
Interest Entities VIEas defined under FIN46.
According to this interpretation, if a company has an interest
in a VIE and is at risk for a majority of the VIEs
expected losses or receives a majority of the VIEs
expected gains it shall consolidate the VIE. FIN46-R also
requires additional disclosures by primary beneficiaries and
other significant variable interest holders. For entities
acquired or created before February1, 2003, this
interpretation is effective no later than the end of the first
interim or reporting period ending after March15, 2004,
except for those VIEs that are considered to be special
purpose entities, for which the effective date is no later than
the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending
after December15, 2003. For all entities that were
acquired subsequent to January31, 2003, this
interpretation is effective as of the first interim or annual
period ending after December31, 2003. The adoption of the
provisions of this interpretation had no effect on our
Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on
Issue No00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements
with Multiple Deliverables. EITFIssue No00-21
addresses determination of whether an arrangement involving more
than one deliverable contains more than one unit of accounting
and how the related revenues should be measured and allocated to
the separate units of accounting. EITFIssue No00-21
applies to revenue arrangements entered into after June30,
2003. The adoption of EITFIssue No00-21 on
July1, 2003 had no impact on our consolidated financial
statements. In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No149, Amendment of
Statement133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities SFAS149. SFAS149
amends and clarifies the accounting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. SFAS149 is generally effective for
contracts entered into or modified after June30, 2003 and
for hedging relationships designated after June30, 2003.
We have limited involvement with derivative financial
instruments and does not use them for trading or speculative
purposes. As of December31, 2003, our only derivative
financial instrument is an interest rate hedge that was entered
into in accordance with the agreement governing the Senior
Secured Credit Facility See Note6 Long-Term
Debt. The adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No149 on July1, 2003, as required, had no
impact on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No150, Accounting
for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both
Liabilities and Equity SFAS150.
SFAS150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies
and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics
of both liabilities and equity. SFAS150 requires that
certain financial instruments be classified as liabilities that
were previously considered equity. The adoption of this standard
on July1, 2003, as required, had no impact on our
consolidated financial statements. Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform
with the current years presentation. 83 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

On March29, 2002, we entered into an
agreement with one of our customers regarding the revision of
the customers sales-type lease agreements as well as
certain other trade receivables. This agreement 84 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued resulted in the termination of the
customers sales-type leases and the establishment of new
operating leases in their place. As a result, we recorded a
non-cash charge in our consolidated income statement during 2002
of $187million. Future cash payments expected from customers
under all long-term contractual agreements backlog described
above, including operating leases, sales-type leases and related
service agreements, aggregated approximately $456billion
as of December31, 2003. Future minimum lease payments due
from customers related to satellites in service and satellites
to be launched totaled approximately $346billion and
$110billion, respectively. Included in the amounts above
are 67contracts representing total backlog of
$5251million, of which $2506million of backlog may
be terminated by the customers pursuant to certain contractual
termination rights.

the orbital life of the satellite. The incentive obligations may
be subject to reduction or refund if the satellite fails to meet
specific technical operating standards. As of December31,

During 2003, we launched our Galaxy12 and

up to three more satellites by the end of 2006. We are currently
scheduled to launch Galaxy14 in the third quarter of 2004
to replace Galaxy5 at 125degrees west longitude. We
currently plan to launch Galaxy15 in the first quarter of
2005 to replace Galaxy1R at 133degrees west
longitude. This satellite will include an additional L-band
payload. Additionally, we currently plan to launch
Galaxy16 in 2006 to replace Galaxy4R at
99degrees west longitude. We are currently negotiating
definitive terms for the procurement of this satellite See
Note12 Commitments and Contingencies below. 85 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued In addition, in the second half of 2004, we
expect to commence construction of Galaxy17, an on-ground
spare for Galaxy11, which will also serve as a spare to
protect against launch failure of Galaxy16. Finally, we
are working with the customers on PAS-6B to address their future
needs. To address those needs we may construct and launch a new
satellite prior to the end of the life of PAS-6B. No commitments
have been made for the procurement of these satellites at this
time. The satellite construction contracts contain
provisions that allow us to terminate the contracts with or
without cause. If terminated without cause, we would forfeit our
progress payments and be subject to termination payments that
escalate with the passage of time. If terminated for cause, we
would be entitled to recover any payments it made under the
contracts and certain liquidated damages as specified in the
contracts. We have entered into launch contracts for the
launch of both specified and unspecified future satellites. Each
of our launch contracts provides that we may terminate such
contract at our option, subject to payment of a termination fee
that increases in magnitude as the applicable launch date
approaches. In addition, in the event of a failure of any
launch, we may exercise the right to obtain a replacement launch
within a specified period following our request for re-launch. We have experienced various technical incidents
on a number of our in-orbit satellites. These incidents
generally have resulted in one or more of the following:
ia limitation or total loss of the satellites
ability to provide the full complement of services that it was
designed to provide, iia material reduction to the
satellites expected orbital life, or iiia
reduction in certain of the satellites on-board redundant
systems exposing it to potential damage in the event of an
additional incident. Whenever we experience a satellite anomaly
or failure, we conduct an investigation of the cause of the
event and determine the effects, if any, that the anomaly may
have on the carrying value of our satellites and other assets
and liabilities.   
BSS 601 HP XIPS The Boeing model 601 HP spacecraft BSS 601
HP uses a Xenon-Ion Propulsion System XIPS
as its primary propulsion system. There are two separate XIPS on
each BSS 601 HP, each one of which is capable of maintaining the
satellite in its orbital position. The spacecraft also has a
completely independent bi-propellant propulsion system as a
backup to the XIPS. As a result, a single failure of a XIPS on a
BSS601 HP typically would have no effect on the
satellites performance or its operating life. A failure of
a second XIPS on a satellite would also have no impact on the
performance of that satellite. However, such a failure would
require the use of the backup bi-propellant propulsion system,
which could result in a shorter operating life for the satellite
depending on the amount of bi-propellant fuel remaining. XIPS
failures do not typically result in a catastrophic failure of
the satellite or affect the communications capability of the
satellite. Certain of our BSS 601 HP spacecraft have
experienced various problems associated with XIPS. We currently
operate seven BSS 601 HP spacecraft, excluding Galaxy8-i.
Galaxy8-i experienced failures of both XIPS in 2000 and
continued to operate using bi-propellant until deorbited in
February 2004. Two of our currently operated BSS 601 HP
satellites have experienced failures of both XIPS. The first of the currently operated satellites
with failure of both primary and secondary XIPS is Galaxy 4R.
This satellite is operating as designed on its backup
bi-propellant propulsion system. We and the manufacturer of this
satellite have determined that the XIPS on this satellite are no
longer available. As a result, this satellites estimated
remaining useful life, based on the bi-propellant fuel on board,
was reduced to approximately 35years from the date of the
secondary XIPS failure. The C-band capacity of this and other
satellites is backed up by in-orbit satellites with immediately
available capacity. We believe that this problem will not affect
revenues from the customers on this satellite or our total
backlog, as the 86 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued satellites backup bi-propellant propulsion
system has sufficient fuel to provide ample time to seamlessly
transition customers to a new or replacement satellite. We have
determined that the satellites net book value and our
investments in sales-type leases on this satellite are fully
recoverable. We began accelerating depreciation on Galaxy 4R
beginning in the third quarter of 2003 to coincide with the
satellites revised estimated useful life. As a result, we
recorded additional depreciation expense of $77million
during 2003. Once a settlement is reached with the final
insurance provider for this satellite, we anticipate that future
depreciation on Galaxy4R will be approximately equal to
the monthly depreciation on this satellite before the anomaly
occurred. We expect to begin building a replacement for this
satellite in the first half of 2004 See Note12
Commitments and Contingencies. The second satellite with failure of both primary
and secondary XIPS is PAS-6B. We and the manufacturer of this
satellite have determined that the XIPS on this satellite are no
longer available. As a result, this satellites estimated
remaining useful life, based on the bi-propellant fuel on board,
was reduced to approximately 49years from the date of the
secondary XIPS failure. Our PAS-6 satellite serves as a partial
backup for certain capacity on PAS-6B. We do not expect this
problem to affect service to our customers or to affect revenues
from the customers on this satellite over the remaining life of
the satellite. We are working with the customers on this
satellite to provide a long-term solution for their needs. As a
result of this XIPS failure, we reduced our total backlog by
approximately $360million. The insurance policy on this
satellite has an exclusion for XIPS-related anomalies and,
accordingly, this was not an insured loss. We began accelerating depreciation on PAS-6B
beginning in the third quarter of 2003 to coincide with the
satellites revised estimated useful life. As a result, we
recorded additional depreciation expense of $66million
during 2003. We have determined that PAS-6Bs net book
value is fully recoverable. Of our five remaining BSS 601 HP satellites,
PAS-5 has no book value and is no longer in primary customer
service. The other four continue to have XIPS as their primary
propulsion system. However, no assurance can be given that we
will not have further XIPS failures that result in shortened
satellite lives or that such failures will be insured if they
occur. For three of these four satellites, the available
bi-propellant life ranges from at least 34years to as
much as 70years, while the fourth satellite, Galaxy 13/
Horizons1, which was placed into service in January 2004,
has available bi-propellant of approximately 119years.   
BSS 702 Solar Arrays All of our satellites have solar arrays that
power their operating systems and transponders and recharge the
batteries used when solar power is not available. Solar array
performance typically degrades over time in a predictable
manner. Additional power margins and other operational
flexibility is designed into satellites to allow for such
degradation without loss of performance or operating life.
Certain Boeing model702 spacecraft BSS 702
have experienced greater than anticipated degradation of their
solar arrays resulting from the design of the solar arrays. Such
degradation could, if continued, result in a shortened operating
life of a satellite or the need to reduce the use of the
communications payload. We currently operate three BSS702
spacecraft, two of which are affected by accelerated solar array
degradation. On February19, 2003, we filed proofs of loss
under the insurance policies for two of our BSS702
spacecraft, Galaxy11 and PAS-1R, for constructive total
losses based on degradation of the solar panels. Service to
existing customers has not been affected, and we expect that
both of these satellites will continue to serve these existing
customers until we replace or supplement them with new
satellites. We are working with the satellite manufacturer to
determine the long-term implications of this degradation to the
satellites and will continue to assess the operational impact.
At this time, based upon all information currently available, as
well as planned modifications to the operation of the satellites
in order to maximize 87 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued revenue generation, we expect to operate these
satellites for the duration of their estimated useful lives,
although a portion of the transponder capacity on these
satellites will not be useable during such time and there may be
a need to provide supplemental capacity in later years. We also
believe that the net book values of these satellites are fully
recoverable and we do not expect a material impact on 2004
revenues as a result of the difficulties with these two
satellites See Note12 Commitments and
Contingencies. The third BSS702 satellite we operate,
Galaxy3C, was launched after the solar array anomaly was
identified, and it has a substantially different solar array
design intended to eliminate the problem. This satellite has
been in service since September 2002 and has not experienced
similar degradation problems. To reduce the effect of anomalies, our satellites
and our network are designed with operational redundancies to
minimize or eliminate service disruptions in the event of
failure of a critical system. These redundancies may include
backup and separate on-board propulsion systems, backup
transponders and conservative system margins for example, fuel
and power. In October 2001, we filed a proof of loss under
the insurance policy on PAS-7 related to circuit failures, which
occurred in September 2001 and resulted in a reduction of 289%
of the satellites total power available for
communications. Service to existing customers was not affected,
and we expect that PAS-7 will continue to serve these customers.
The insurance policy was in the amount of $2534million
and included a provision for us to share 25% of future revenues
on PAS-7 with the insurers. In the first quarter of 2002, our
insurers confirmed to us their agreement to settle the PAS-7
insurance claim by payment to us of $215million. Pursuant
to this agreement, no future revenue share payments will be
required to be made in relation to PAS-7. During the first
quarter of 2002, we recorded a gain of approximately
$401million related to the PAS-7 insurance claim, which
reflected the net proceeds agreed to by the insurers less the
net book value of the PAS-7 satellite, including incentive
obligations. We received the $215million of insurance
proceeds in 2002. At the end of the third quarter of 2000, the
Galaxy8-i satellite experienced difficulties with its
XIPS, an electronic propulsion system that is used to maintain
the spacecrafts proper orbit and altitude. We began
accelerating depreciation of the spacecraft in the fourth
quarter of 2000 to reflect its revised operational life,
resulting in an increase in depreciation expense of
approximately $150million per quarter. Galaxy8-i
was fully depreciated in July 2002 and was deorbited in February
2004. As a result of the termination of the
Galaxy8-iR satellite construction contract, we received
$695million from the satellite manufacturer in December
2003, which represents amounts previously paid to the
manufacturer of approximately $588million, liquidated
damages and interest owed to us under the construction
agreement. In addition, we have agreed with the Galaxy8-iR
launch vehicle provider to defer our use of the launch to a
future satellite. We expect to use this launch in early 2006 to
replace the Galaxy4R satellite. 5.Goodwill On January1, 2002, we adopted
SFAS142. Among other things, SFAS142 provides that
intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives not be
amortized, but rather be tested for impairment annually or when
a change in circumstances occurs. We have determined that, for
such impairment testing, we have only one reporting unit, which
is at the enterprise level. SFAS142 requires the use of fair value in
determining the amount of impairment, if any, for recorded
goodwill. In conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment
assessment in the fourth quarter of 2003, we utilized an
independent valuation expert to assist us in our assessment of
the fair value of our reporting unit using a combined discounted
cash flow and market approach. Our valuation resulted in a fair
value for the reporting unit which exceeded the carrying value
of our goodwill and, as such, no 88 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued impairment charge was required in 2002 or 2003.
The amount of any loss resulting from future impairment tests
could be material to our results of operations. The adoption of SFAS142 resulted in the
elimination of goodwill amortization beginning January1,
2002. As of December31, 2003 and 2002, we had goodwill of
approximately $2244billion and $2239, respectively. The
increase in goodwill during 2003 of $50million is
attributable to certain acquisitions made during 2003 See
Note8 Acquisitions. Prior to the adoption of
SFAS142, our annual goodwill amortization was
approximately $65million. Net income and earnings per
share for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001
adjusted to exclude amortization expense related to goodwill
which is no longer amortized, are as follows

Fair value amounts were determined based on

to us for debt with similar maturities and similar terms. Our
$200million 60% notes issued in 1998 matured on
January15, 2003 and were repaid in full from available
cash. On July14, 2003 and December29, 2003, we made
optional pre-payments of $350million and
$300million, respectively, under our $125billion
Senior Secured Credit Facility from available cash on hand. 89 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued   
Refinancing In February 2002, we entered into our Senior
Secured Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up
to $125billion and completed an $800million private
placement debt offering of our Senior Notes pursuant to
Rule144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We
refer to these transactions as the Refinancing. We
used $1725billion of the proceeds from the Refinancing to
repay in full the indebtedness owed under the term loan to
Hughes Electronics. The Senior Notes were exchanged for
registered notes with substantially identical terms in November
2002. Prior to the pre-payments noted above and the
October29, 2003 amendment described below, the Senior
Secured Credit Facility was comprised of a $2500million
revolving credit facility, which was undrawn and had an original
termination date of December31, 2007 the Revolving
Facility, a $3000million Term A Facility, which
had an original maturity date of December31, 2007, and a
$7000million Term B Facility, which had an original
maturity date of December31, 2008. At October28,
2003, the interest rates on the Term A Facility and TermB
Facility were LIBOR plus 275% and LIBOR plus 35%, respectively. On June18, 2003, we and the lenders under
our Senior Secured Credit Facility amended the loan agreement to
allow for the completion of the News Corporation Transactions
without causing an event of default under such facility. On October29, 2003, we amended our Senior
Secured Credit Facility to provide for the refinancing of our
TermA Facility and TermB Facility under a new Term
LoanB-1 facility the TermB-1 Facility
the TermB-1 Facility Amendment with an
interest rate of LIBOR plus 25% and scheduled annual maturities

As a result of this amendment, the amount of the
revolving credit facility, its termination date and the
provisions relating to the commitment fee remain unchanged. The
$2500million revolving credit facility, which is
presently undrawn, will terminate on December31, 2007 the
Revolving Facility. Currently, the Revolving
Facility also bears interest at LIBOR plus 25%, although these
interest rates are subject to adjustment based on our total
leverage ratio. In addition, we are required to pay to the
lenders under the Revolving Facility a commitment fee in respect
of the unused commitments at a rate that is subject to
adjustment based on our total leverage ratio. As of
December31, 2003, this commitment fee rate was 0375% per
year and the applicable interest rate on the TermB-1
Facility was 364%. We had outstanding letters of credit
totaling $11million, which reduced our ability to borrow
against the Revolving Facility by such amount. Fees charged by
the lenders for this amendment will be capitalized as debt
issuance costs and amortized over the revised term of the
TermB-1 Facility, along with previously capitalized debt
issuance costs related to the Term A Facility and the
TermB Facility. The indenture governing the Senior Notes due in
2012 and the agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit
Facility contain various covenants that impose significant
restrictions on our business. These covenants limit our ability
to, among other things: incur or guarantee additional
indebtedness; make 90 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued certain payments such as dividends; create or
permit to exist certain liens; enter into business combinations;
make investments; enter into transactions with affiliates and
enter into new businesses. The Senior Secured Credit Facility
also limits our ability to sell certain assets. The
TermB-1 Facility Amendment adjusted certain operating
covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facility to provide
greater operational flexibility to us. As of December31,
2003, we were in compliance with all such covenants. In accordance with the agreement governing the
Senior Secured Credit Facility, we entered into an interest rate
hedge agreement for 10% of the outstanding borrowings under the
Senior Secured Credit Facility during the third quarter of 2002.
We exchanged our floating-rate obligation on $1000million
of our TermB Facility for a fixed-rate payment obligation
of 664% on $1000million through August30, 2005.
This interest rate hedge was designated as a cash flow hedge of
our variable rate TermB Facility until the
October29, 2003 TermB-1 Facility Amendment,
described above. In conjunction with this amendment, the terms
of this interest rate hedge were unchanged and the hedge
continued on the TermB-1 Facility at the rate of 564%
based upon the interest rate applicable to the new TermB-1
Facility. The notional amount of the interest rate hedge
agreement matches the repayment schedule of the TermB-1
Facility though the maturity date of the interest rate hedge.
During the year ended December31, 2003, no ineffectiveness
was recognized in the statement of operations on this hedge. In
the unlikely event that the counterparty fails to meet the terms
of the interest rate hedge agreement, our exposure is limited to
the interest rate differential on the notional amount at each
quarterly settlement period over the life of the agreements. We
do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparty. The amount
accumulated in other comprehensive income will fluctuate based
on the change in the fair value of the derivative at each
reporting period, net of applicable deferred income taxes. The
fair value of the interest rate hedge agreement is the estimated
amount that we would pay or receive to terminate the agreement
at the reporting date, taking into account current interest
rates, the market expectation for future interest rates and our
current creditworthiness. The fair value of the outstanding
interest rate hedge agreement as of December31, 2003,
based upon quoted market prices from the counterparty, reflected
a liability of approximately $21million which is included
in deferred credits and other liabilities on our consolidated
balance sheet. Pursuant to the TermB-1 Facility Amendment,
we will no longer be required to enter into an interest rate
hedge agreement under the Senior Secured Credit Facility upon
expiration of the current agreement on August30, 2005. Obligations under the Senior Notes are, or will
be, as the case may be, unconditionally guaranteed by each of
our existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic
and, to the extent no adverse tax consequences would result
therefrom, foreign restricted subsidiaries. All subsidiary
guarantors, individually and in the aggregate, represent less
than 1% of our consolidated total assets, total liabilities,
revenues, stockholders equity, income from continuing
operations before income taxes and cash flows from operating
activities, and such subsidiaries have no independent assets or
operations determined in accordance with the criteria
established for parent companies in the SECs
RegulationS-X, Rule3-10h. All subsidiary
guarantors and all of our subsidiaries, other than the
subsidiary guarantors, are minor as defined in the SECs
RegulationS-X, Rule3-10h. Accordingly, condensed
consolidating financial information for us and our subsidiaries,
within the notes to our consolidating financial statements, is
not presented. The Senior Notes bear interest at an annual rate
of 85%, subject to increases pursuant to a registration rights
agreement entered into in connection with the issuance of the
Senior Notes. The Senior Notes require interest payments to be
made semi-annually, mature in 2012, are unsecured, and are
guaranteed, on a full and unconditional and joint and several
basis, by all of our domestic 100% owned subsidiaries. In addition to the Senior Secured Credit Facility
and the Senior Notes, we have outstanding seven, ten and
thirty-year fixed rate notes totaling $550million issued
in January 1998. The outstanding principal 91 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued balances, interest rates and maturity dates for
these notes as of December31, 2003 were $275million
at 6125% due 2005, $150million at 6375% due 2008 and
$125million at 6875% due 2028, respectively. Principal on
these notes is payable at maturity, while interest is payable
semi-annually. In connection with the Refinancing, these notes
have been ratably secured by substantially all of our assets on
a pari-passu basis with the security interests covering our
obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. We had $465million principal amount
outstanding under notes assumed in connection with our exercise
in July 1999 of an early buy-out opportunity for certain
transponders under a sale-leaseback transaction relating to our
Galaxy 3R satellite. The Galaxy3R Notes matured on
January2, 2002 and were repaid in full plus accrued

also had $1357million of deferred tax assets relating to
federal and state net operating losses that expire in varying
amounts over the period of 2004-2023 if not utilized and a
$74million deferred tax asset relating to foreign tax
credit carryforwards that expire between the years 2004-2008 if
not utilized. During 2003, we recorded a valuation allowance for
foreign tax credits of $74million that are likely to
expire prior to being utilized. Issues regarding our taxability in foreign
jurisdictions have been raised by various tax authorities. Such
authorities have proposed tax adjustments and we have vigorously
contested them. In 2003, we increased our income tax provision
for these adjustments and, in managements opinion,
adequate provision has been made for all open years. During 2002, the Internal Revenue Service
commenced an examination of the GM consolidated tax group for
the years 1998-2000 of which we are a member. As a result, our
federal income tax returns for those years are currently under
examination. Management believes that adequate provision has
been made for any adjustment which might be assessed as a result
of these examinations. 93 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued 8.Acquisitions On March7, 2003, we acquired substantially
all of the assets of Hughes Global Services, Inc.
HGS from our affiliate, Hughes Electronics, for
approximately $84million in cash and the assumption of
certain related liabilities. In connection with this
transaction, the HGS-3, HGS-5 and Leasat satellites are now
operated as part of our fleet. HGS provides end-to-end satellite
communications services to government entities, both
domestically and internationally, as well as to certain private
sector customers and is also a value-added reseller of satellite
bandwidth and related services and equipment. The acquisition
supports our strategic initiative to expand government service
offerings through our wholly owned subsidiary, formerly a
division of ours, G2Satellite Solutions Corporation. The
historical cost of the net assets acquired were as follows in

Since we and HGS are under the common control of
Hughes Electronics, the excess purchase price over the
historical cost of the net assets acquired of approximately
$53million was recorded as a reduction to our
stockholders equity on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet as of December31, 2003 net of deferred
income taxes of approximately $19million. On August27, 2003, as part of our strategic
initiative to expand our government service offerings, we
acquired a telecommunications firm based outside of Washington,
D.C. that specializes in providing end-to-end services and
solutions to the U.S.Government, Esatel Communications,
Inc. Esatel and its related entity, Silver Springs
Teleport, LC. To complement our ground infrastructure, in
November 2003, we purchased Sonic Telecommunications
International Ltd. Sonic, a provider of
international high-definition multimedia transmission services
and business applications. Sonics existing fiber optic
network will allow us to extend the capabilities of our
teleports to any location that is connectable to our teleports
through that network and will provide customers with a seamless
satellite/ fiber network that will deliver video content to
multiple locations in a highly secure manner with robust
redundancy. The aggregate purchase price for the Esatel and
Sonic acquisitions was $118million. The net assets
acquired included receivables, property, plant and equipment,
customer lists, and goodwill as well as certain assumed
liabilities. The results of these acquisitions are included
within our consolidated income statement for 2003 from the date
of acquisition through December31. 9.Related Party
Transactions and Borrowings   
Transactions with News Corporation and Its
Affiliates other than Hughes Electronics On December22, 2003, News Corporation, GM
and Hughes Electronics announced that they successfully
completed the split-off of Hughes Electronics from GM and the
acquisition by News Corporation of 34percent of the
outstanding common stock of Hughes Electronics. After completion
of the transaction, News Corporation transferred its entire
34percent interest in Hughes Electronics to Fox
Entertainment, in which News Corporation has an equity interest
of approximately 820percent and voting power of
approximately 97percent. We are a party to agreements with News
Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates
pursuant to which we provide satellite capacity, TTC and
other related services. Revenues derived from the News
Corporation and its affiliates were $918million in 2003,
or 11% of our revenues in 2003. As of 94 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued December31, 2003, we had receivables due
from News Corporation and its affiliates of approximately
$324million. This receivable balance is primarily
comprised of a long-term receivable related to an operating
lease with escalating payment terms that is being recognized on
a straight-line basis into revenue over the lease term. In January 2004, we and Fox Entertainment signed
a multi-year, multi-satellite agreement, the terms of which
provide that Fox Entertainment will consolidate its entire suite
of U.S. cable and broadcast programming onto our global fleet
for 15years and move a significant portion of its
international traffic onto the fleet for the next decade. Fox
Entertainment will now be one of our largest media customers and
one of its top five global customers.   
Transactions with Hughes Electronics and
Its Affiliates We provide satellite capacity, TTC and other
related services and facilities to several subsidiaries of
Hughes Electronics and purchases certain services and equipment
from a Hughes Electronics subsidiary. Additionally, we reimburse
Hughes Electronics for the allocated costs of certain expense
items it jointly incurs with Hughes Electronics, principally
relating to administrative and other expenses. The aggregate

Tax Sharing Agreements We currently operate under federal and state
income tax sharing agreements with Hughes Electronics, our
parent corporation See Note2 Significant Accounting
Policies Income Taxes and Note7
Income Taxes above.   
Satellite Procurement
Agreements We are a party to agreements with The Boeing
Company Boeing, formerly Hughes Space and
Communications Company HSC, for the construction
of satellites. Prior to the sale of HSC to Boeing on
October6, 2000, HSC was an affiliate of ours. We believe
the agreements, which became obligations of Boeing following the
consummation of the sale by Hughes Electronics of HSC to Boeing,
are on commercially reasonable terms, as each was procured
through a competitive bidding process. We entered 95 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued into an agreement in October 1998 for the
construction of up to six satellites Galaxy10R,
Galaxy4R, PAS-9, PAS-10, Galaxy8-iR and
Galaxy13/ Horizons 1, all of which were ordered.
Galaxy10R, Galaxy4R, PAS-9 and PAS-10 were placed in
service prior to 2002. During 2003, the construction contract
for Galaxy8-iR was mutually terminated by us and Boeing.
Galaxy13/ Horizons 1 was launched on October1, 2003
and was placed in service in January 2004. Pursuant to such
agreements and prior agreements with HSC for the construction of
PAS-2, PAS-3, PAS-4, PAS-5, PAS-6B, PAS-1R, Galaxy11,
Galaxy3C, and Galaxy13/ Horizons 1 a portion of the
contract price between 15% and 20% for each satellite is paid
in the form of incentive payments to be paid to HSC over a 12 to
15year period after the construction and launch of the
applicable satellite. As HSC was sold to Boeing on
October6, 2000, we did not record any satellite purchases
from HSC during 2003, 2002 or 2001. In October 2003, Hughes Electronics committed to
acquire a new satellite from Space Systems/ Loral, which would
replace our Galaxy4R satellite and would be known as
Galaxy16. We are currently negotiating definitive terms
for our acquisition of this satellite. While we have made no
commitment to any launch provider for the launch of this
satellite, we do have launch services already under contract
which could be used for this satellite.   
Acquisition of Hughes Global
Services On March7, 2003, we acquired substantially
all of the assets of HGS from Hughes Electronics See
Note8 Acquisitions above.   
Hughes Electronics Term Loan Prior to the refinancing of our indebtedness in
February 2002, we owed Hughes Electronics $1725billion.
We repaid Hughes Electronics with the proceeds of the
refinancing on February25, 2002. We did not make, and we
were not required to make, any principal payments on the term
loan prior to its repayment. During the years ended
December31, 2002 and 2001, we made approximately
$77million and $824million, respectively, of
interest payments to Hughes Electronics. The interest rate on
the loan was tied to the interest rate on our then existing
revolving credit facility. The interest rate on the term loan as
of the repayment date was 230%. As a result of certain arrangements between
Hughes Electronics and us, Hughes Electronics reimbursed us for
certain fees and expenses incurred in the Refinancing. Such
reimbursement was approximately $26million and was
received in 2002 See Note6 Long-Term Debt.   
Other Hughes Electronics
Transactions In addition, Hughes Electronics and other Hughes
entities lease office space in Long Beach, California and land
for our teleport in Castle Rock, Colorado, to us and provide
general liability insurance and certain administrative services
to us, including the provision of certain advisory and audit
services, and permit the participation by us and our employees
in certain discount programs. During the years ended
December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we incurred expenses
related to such arrangements with Hughes Electronics entities of
approximately $19million, $14million and
$19million, respectively. During 2003, we transferred an authorization for
a Ka-band orbital slot to Hughes Network Systems, Inc.
HNS, an affiliate, in exchange for a contingent
payment of approximately $21million. The payment is
payable upon the launch of a satellite by HNS to such orbital
slot. The Federal Communications Commission has approved the
transfer of this authorization. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we agreed to
amend our transponder lease agreements with DIRECTV Latin
America DTVLA. This amendment became effective in
February 2004 upon DTVLAs emergence from the
Chapter11 bankruptcy process. In conjunction with these
amendments we agreed to accept reduced cash payments in the
early years, most of which we expect to recapture in later 96 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued years, and Hughes Electronics has agreed to
guarantee all of the transponder lease agreements with DTVLA for
a period of five years. Included in our total backlog of
$456billion as of December31, 2003 is
$130billion of backlog from News Corporation, Hughes
Electronics and their affiliates, of which $767million
may be terminated pursuant to certain contractual termination
rights. Backlog represents future cash payments expected from
customers under all long-term contractual agreements. 10.Retirement
and Incentive Plans   
Employee Benefit Plans Defined Contribution Plans 401k
Plan We have a 401k
plan for qualifying employees. We match a portion of the
employee contributions with shares of our common stock. The
number of shares contributed to the plan and the respective
market values were 135,561, 96,216, and 68,423 shares and $21
million, $18million, and $22million for 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively. Deferred Compensation
Plan We have a
Supplemental Savings Plan and a Deferred Compensation Plan for
eligible employees. Under both plans, executives and other
highly compensated employees are entitled to defer a portion of
their compensation to future years. The annual amount that can
be deferred is subject to certain limitations, and a portion of
the employees contribution may be matched if the employee
elected to defer the maximum amount permissible under the 401k
plan and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The
maximum annual match under the 401k plan is limited to an
aggregate level of 4% of annual compensation. The matched
portion of the Supplemental Savings Plan consists of
credits which vest when awarded. Contributions that
receive employer matching are required to be deferred until
termination of employment, and any non-matched contributions may
be deferred over a period selected by the employee. In addition,
we, at our discretion, may make contributions to the Deferred
Compensation Plan and the Supplemental Savings Plan for the
benefit of any participant as supplemental compensation. The
Deferred Compensation Plan and the Supplemental Savings Plan are
unfunded plans, and the deferrals and matching credits will
receive earnings based upon rates set by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors the Compensation
Committee, but in no event will these amounts earn less
than 100% of the Moodys Corporate Bond Index Rate. 1997 Stock Incentive
Plan On May5,
1997, our Board of Directors adopted the PanAmSat Corporation
Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan the Stock Plan,
which provides for the granting of nonqualified stock options,
incentive stock options, alternate appreciation rights,
restricted stock, performance units and performance shares to
executive officers, other employees, directors and our
independent contractors. Restricted stock, performance units and
performance shares may be granted at the discretion of the
Compensation Committee on such terms as the committee may
decide. Effective December7, 2000, we amended the Stock
Plan to provide that, upon a Change in Control as
defined of us, all unvested stock options and other awards
granted under the Stock Plan would immediately vest and become
exercisable, and restrictions on any awards such as restricted
stock would immediately lapse. The recently completed News
Corporation Transactions did not meet the definition for a
Change in Control as defined by the Stock Plan. We currently
estimate that upon a change-in control, we will be required to
record a charge of up to approximately $03million within
our consolidated statement of income as a result of this
amendment. Also effective December7, 2000, the Stock Plan
was amended to eliminate the portability of unvested options for
employees transferring to non-controlled affiliates, such as
Hughes Electronics. As approved by our Board of Directors in December
2000 and as subsequently ratified by our stockholders in June
2001, the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be
issued under the Stock Plan was increased to 17,456,140. The
maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued to
any grantee pursuant to the plan is 2,000,000. The Stock Plan is
administered by the 97 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Compensation Committee. As of December31,
2003, nonqualified options for 6,819,565 shares of common stock
net of options expired or terminated have been granted under
the Stock Plan. Such options are exercisable at a price equal to
100% of the fair market value at the date of grant and vest
ratably over three to four years. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, we
issued 0, 0 and 2,336,250 options, respectively, under a
two-year grant program with ratable vesting over a four-year
period, and 49,200, 1,915,100 and 641,505 and options,
respectively, under the existing annual grant program with
ratable vesting over three years. Activity in our Stock Plan
during the past three years is summarized below

Effective January1, 2003, we adopted the
fair value recognition provision of FASB Statement No123,
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation,
prospectively, to all employee awards granted on or after
January1, 2003, pursuant to FASB Statement No148,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Transition and Disclosure. Therefore, we recorded
compensation expense for employee stock options granted after
December31, 2002, but not in relation to previous awards
granted. 98 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued During the year ended December31, 2003, we
issued 49,200 options to purchase shares under the Stock Plan.
Compensation expense for these options is based on the fair
value of the options at the respective grant dates utilizing the
Black-Scholes model for estimating fair value. We recorded
compensation expense related to these options of approximately
$34 thousand during 2003. Under the intrinsic value method
reported previously, no compensation expense had been recognized
on options granted through December31, 2002, as the
exercise price of the options granted equaled the market price
of our common stock on the date of grant for all prior grants. On April30, 2003, the Compensation
Committee approved the issuance of up to 500,000 restricted
stock units under the Stock Plan. On April30, 2003 and
November3, 2003 we issued 398,500 and 2,000, respectively,
of these restricted stock units under the Stock Plan to certain
employees. The restricted stock units vest 50% on the second
anniversary of the grant date and the remaining 50% on the third
anniversary. Stock compensation expense is being recognized over
the vesting period based on our stock price on the April and
November grant dates of $1730 and $2145, respectively. We
recorded compensation expense related to the restricted stock
units of approximately $18million during 2003 See
Note2 Significant Accounting Policies
Recent Accounting Pronouncements. The weighted average fair value of options
granted in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $566 per share, $870 per
share and $1557 per share, respectively. These estimates were

From 1998 to 2001, directors who were not
full-time employees received their annual retainers in shares of
our restricted common stock. The shares were issued each year
after our annual meeting, vested quarterly over the course of
the year served, and could not be sold for a period of six
months after vesting, subject to our trading policies. Directors
also received meeting fees in shares of our restricted common
stock. The shares were issued after each in-person or telephonic
board or committee meeting attended, and could not be sold for a
period of six months following the date of grant, subject to our
trading policies. As a group, each member of the Board of
Directors who is not our employee or our affiliates
Non-Employee Director received 4,335 shares with a
weighted average fair value of $4527 per share in 2000 and
7,468 shares with a weighted average fair value of $3766 per
share in 1999. Directors also were granted non-qualified stock
options for 1,216 shares at an average price of $3588 in 1999,
and 4,284 shares at an average price of $5309 in 1998 under the
Stock Plan as described above upon their initial year of
election to the Board of Directors. Director stock option grants
vest over a six-month period from the date of grant and all
5,500 shares became exercisable in 1999. On December7, 2000, our Board of Directors
approved a compensation program for Non-Employee Directors, the
PanAmSat Corporation Non-Employee Directors Fee Plan. Effective
January1, 2001, each Non-Employee Director was eligible to
receive an annual fee of $50,000 for services rendered as a
member of the Board of Directors and an additional annual $5,000
fee for each member who serves as a chairperson of a committee
of the Board of Directors. Each Non-Employee Director may elect
to receive up to 50% of the aggregate amount of the fee in cash.
Any amount not paid to a Non-Employee Director in cash will be
paid in restricted shares of our common stock. The number of
shares to be issued in payment of the fees will be calculated
based on the average daily closing price of our common stock on
Nasdaq during the month prior to the date of grant. The shares
vest 100% on the first anniversary of the 99 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued date the shares are granted; prior to being fully
vested, such shares will be subject to forfeiture upon the
termination of a board members services. Directors may
also elect to defer the fees, payable in stock, in the form of
units of our common stock, to the PanAmSat Corporation 1999
Non-Employee Directors Compensation Deferral Plan. During 2002,
Non-Employee Directors were granted 3,585 restricted shares and
3,701 restricted units that were deferred at a price of $2162
per share and cash of $57,500. In 2001, Non-Employee Directors
were granted 2,093 restricted shares and 4,303 restricted units
were deferred at a price of $3834 per share and cash of $25,000. On February28, 2003, our Board of Directors
approved a revised compensation program for Non-Employee
Directors under the PanAmSat Corporation Non-Employee Directors
Fee Plan the Revised Compensation Program.
Pursuant to the Revised Compensation Program, effective
January1, 2003, each Non-Employee Director was eligible to
receive an annual fee of $75,000 for services rendered as a
member of the Board of Directors, which is payable at each
directors election either aall in restricted stock
granted under the Stock Plan or bup to 40% $30,000 in
cash and the balance in restricted stock. Additionally, under
the Revised Compensation Program, the Non-Employee Director
chairing the audit committee was eligible to receive an
additional annual fee of $15,000 and each Non-Employee Director
who serves as a chairperson of a committee of the Board of
Directors other than the audit committee was eligible to receive
an additional annual fee of $10,000. Each of these additional
fees are payable at such directors election either
aall in restricted stock granted under our Stock Plan or
bup to 50% in cash. The number of shares to be issued in
payment of the fees will be calculated based on the average
daily closing price of our common stock on Nasdaq during the
month prior to the date of grant. The shares vest 100% on the
first anniversary of the date the shares are granted; prior to
being fully vested, such shares will be subject to forfeiture
upon the termination of a board members services.
Directors may also elect to defer the fees payable in stock, in
the form of units of our common stock, to the PanAmSat
Corporation 1999 Non-Employee Directors Compensation Deferral
Plan. During 2003, Non-Employee Directors were granted 7,813
restricted shares and 6,406 restricted units were deferred at a
price of $1600 per share and cash of $107,500. In January 1999, we terminated the stock options
previously granted to a senior executive of ours and issued new
options to this individual whose status changed from employee to
consultant. Under the terms of the new option agreement, the
options have strike prices equal to the strike prices of the
former options and vest over a six-month period. The new options
have a term of five years and contain a twelve-month non-compete
restriction with respect to options exercised on or before
December31, 2000. These nonqualified stock options were
not issued from shares reserved for the Stock Plan and consist
of options for 40,000 shares at a strike price of $3900 per
share, and 31,250 shares with a strike price of $2900 per
share. In 1999, compensation expense of $12million was
recognized relative to these options based on the Black-Scholes
valuation of the options as they vested. Compensation Plans
On May16, 1997, we
assumed the certain obligations of PanAmSat International with
respect to its General Severance Policy, Employee Separation
Plan and an Executive Severance Pay Program. These plans allow
for benefits to be paid to the former employees of PanAmSat
International who became our employees as a result of the Merger
under certain circumstances relating to a termination of
employment. The benefits provided under these programs expired
at various dates through May 1999. Agreements with two of our
officers were replaced with new retention agreements that
provide for cash payments and the issuance of restricted stock
units that entitle the holder to receive shares of our common
stock. These latter agreements contain a vesting term of three
years, and the related compensation expense is being amortized
over the vesting period. Two of our other officers exercised
their severance agreements and were entitled to separation
payments that are subject to a non-compete agreement. A portion

Facilities Restructuring and Severance
Costs Facilities restructuring and severance costs were
$42million and $137million for the years ended
December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As part of our continuing effort to improve
operational efficiencies, in October 2003 our management
approved a plan to reduce our workforce by approximately
45employees. As a result, we recorded a severance charge
of approximately $14million in the fourth quarter of
2003. These severance costs were primarily be related to
employee compensation, benefits and outplacement services. In January 2003, our management approved a plan
to consolidate certain of our teleports in order to improve
customer service and reduce operating costs. Under this plan,
our Homestead teleport was closed in 2003 and we expect to close
our Spring Creek teleport during 2004. In addition, our Fillmore
and Castle Rock teleports will provide reduced services. This
teleport consolidation plan will include the disposal of land,
buildings and equipment located at these teleports and severance
related costs for approximately 40 employees which will be
required to perform future services. During 2003, we recorded
charges of $42million related to this teleport
consolidation plan, primarily representing severance costs. On March29, 2002, our management approved a
plan to restructure several of our United States locations and
close certain facilities, some of which are currently being
leased through 2011. We recorded a non-cash charge in our
consolidated income statement of $139million. This charge
reflected future lease costs, net of estimated future sublease
revenue, of $98million related to approximately 113,000
square feet of unused facilities and the write-off of
approximately $41million of leasehold improvements
related to these facilities. In 2003, we recorded restructuring
credits of $14million related to the signing of sub-lease
agreements for amounts higher than originally estimated. We recorded severance costs of $82million
for the year ended December31, 2001. An additional
$13million of severance costs was recorded during the
first quarter of 2002. These costs were related to our expense
reduction and NET-36 now webcast services restructuring plan
that began in the third quarter of 2001 and were primarily
comprised of employee compensation and benefits, outplacement
services and legal and consulting expenses associated with the
workforce reduction. During 2002, we recorded a restructuring
credit of $15million for the reversal of prior period
severance charges due to actual legal costs being lower than
originally estimated and a lower than anticipated use of certain
outplacement service and other benefits. The following table summarizes the recorded
accruals and activity related to these teleport consolidation,
facilities restructuring and severance charges in millions

Commitments and Contingencies We have commitments for operating leases
primarily relating to equipment and our executive office
facilities in Wilton, Connecticut and various other locations.
These leases contain escalation provisions for increases as a
result of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses.

Rental expenses under the operating leases were

Satellite Commitments We have invested approximately $42billion
in our existing satellite fleet and ground infrastructure
through December31, 2003, and had commitments for
approximately $342million of expenditures remaining under
existing satellite construction contracts and $505million
remaining under existing satellite launch contracts as of
December31, 2003. These commitments related to satellite
construction and launch contracts are net of approximately
$61million of costs to be paid by JSAT International Inc.
in conjunction with our Horizons joint venture. Satellite launch
and in-orbit insurance contracts related to future satellites to
be launched are cancelable, up to thirty days prior to the
satellites launch. As of December31, 2003, we did
not have any commitments related to existing launch insurance or
in-orbit insurance contracts for satellites to be launched. In October 2003, we amended our launch and
construction contracts related to the Galaxy1R replacement
satellite to allow for the construction of a navigation payload
on this satellite. This navigation payload will utilize L-band
frequencies and will function independently from the C-band
payload. We currently have remaining commitments in relation to
these contracts of approximately $128million. We have
entered into an agreement with a customer for the sale and use
of this L-band payload. In October 2003, Hughes Electronics committed to
acquire a new satellite from Space Systems/ Loral, which would
replace our Galaxy4R satellite and would be known as
Galaxy16. We are currently negotiating definitive terms
for the procurement of this satellite. While we have made no
commitment to any launch provider for the launch of this
satellite, we do have prepaid launch services already under
contract, which could be used for this satellite.   
Satellite Insurance On February19, 2003, we filed proofs of
loss under the insurance policies for two of our BSS702
spacecraft, Galaxy11 and PAS-1R, for constructive total
losses based on degradation of the solar panels. The insurance
policies for Galaxy11 and PAS-1R were in the amounts of
approximately $289million and $345million,
respectively, for total losses, and both included a salvage
provision requiring that we share 10% of future revenues from
these satellites with the insurers. On December29, 2003 we
reached a partial loss settlement of these insurance claims for
payment of $260million with no future revenue share. This
negotiated resolution balances the expected loss of capacity and
the remaining use expected to be achieved 102 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued with respect to the satellites. The availability
and use of any proceeds from the Galaxy11 and PAS-1R
insurance claims are restricted by the agreements governing our
debt obligations. As of the date hereof, we have received
substantially all of the settlement amount and plan on using
these proceeds to replace existing satellites over the next
several years. At the end of June 2003, the secondary XIPS on
our Galaxy 4R satellite ceased working. On July31, 2003,
we filed a proof of loss under the insurance policy for our
Galaxy 4R spacecraft, in the amount of $169million,
subject to salvage. During the third quarter of 2003, we reached
an agreement with all but one of the insurers representing, in
the aggregate, approximately 83percent of the insurance
coverage on the satellite. As a result, in the third quarter of
2003, we recorded an insurance claim receivable of
$1026million reflecting the insurance policy amount for
these insurers less a negotiated settlement for salvage. We
received these proceeds during the fourth quarter of 2003. We
proportionately offset the proceeds from this settlement against
the insured carrying value of the satellite and the net
investment in sales-type lease. In October 2003, we commenced
arbitration proceedings against the last insurance provider over
a disputed portion of the remaining claim. We cannot assure you that we will be successful
in these proceedings or, if successful, how much we will
receive. We are developing plans to replace this satellite prior
to the end of its useful life using anticipated insurance
proceeds and a spare launch service contract that we had
purchased previously. As of December31, 2003 we had in effect
launch and in-orbit insurance policies covering 11 satellites in
the aggregate amount of approximately $11billion. As of
such date, these insured satellites had an aggregate net book
value and other insurable costs of $14billion. We have
15uninsured satellites in orbit. The uninsured satellites
are: PAS-4 and PAS-6, which are used as backup satellites; PAS-5
and PAS-7 for which we received insurance proceeds for
constructive total losses; Galaxy1R, Galaxy3R,
Galaxy5 and SBS-6, which are approaching the ends of their
useful lives; Galaxy8-i, which is fully depreciated and
was deorbited in February 2004; Galaxy11 and PAS-1R which
we recently reached a settlement of these insurance claims for
payment to us of $260million; Galaxy9 for which we
determined that insurance was not available on commercially
reasonable terms; and HGS-3, HGS-5 and Leasat, which have an
aggregate book value of less than $1million. Our
Galaxy12 and Galaxy 9satellites serve as an in-orbit
backup for all or portions of Galaxy1R, Galaxy4R,
Galaxy5, Galaxy10R, Galaxy11 and
Galaxy13/ Horizons1. Of the insured satellites, as of
December31, 2003, seven were covered by policies with
substantial exclusions or exceptions to coverage for failures of
specific components identified by the underwriters as at risk
for possible failure Significant Exclusion
Policies. The exclusions reduce the probability of an
insurance recovery in the event of a loss on these satellites.
Four of these satellites, PAS-2, PAS-3R, PAS-8 and PAS-9 have
operational redundancies available for the systems on which
exclusions have been imposed. We believe that these redundancies
allow for uninterrupted operation of the satellite in the event
of a failure of the component subject to the insurance
exclusion. The fifth such satellite, PAS-6B is currently
operating on its backup bi-propellant propulsion system See
Note4 Satellite and Other Property and
Equipment Net. The sixth such satellite,
Galaxy4R, for which a proof of loss has been filed as
described above, has a remaining policy covering
$206million of investments in sales-type leases that is
subject to a component exclusion. Galaxy4R is currently
operating on its backup bi-propellant propulsion system. The
seventh satellite, Galaxy 13/ Horizons1, which was
launched on October1, 2003, continues to have a fully
redundant XIPS as its primary propulsion system. Certain
enhancements have been made to XIPS on this satellite to make
the systems more robust. In addition, this satellite has
available backup bi-propellant of approximately 119years. At December31, 2003, the uninsured
satellites and the satellites insured by Significant Exclusion
Policies had a total net book value and other insurable costs of
approximately $13billion. Of this amount 103 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued 584million related to uninsured satellites
and $752million related to satellites insured by
Significant Exclusion Policies. Upon the expiration of the insurance policies,
there can be no assurance that we will be able to procure new
policies on commercially reasonable terms. New policies may only
be available with higher premiums or with substantial exclusions
or exceptions to coverage for failures of specific components. An uninsured failure of one or more of our
satellites could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations. In addition, higher
premiums on insurance policies will increase our costs, thereby
reducing our operating income by the amount of such increased
premiums.   
Customer and Vendor
Obligations We have certain contracts with our customers
which require that we provide equipment, services and other
support to these customers during the course of the related
contracts. As of December31, 2003, we had commitments
under these customer contracts which aggregated approximately
$350million related to the provision of equipment,
services and other support. We have certain long-term contractual obligations
with service providers primarily for the operation of certain of
our satellites. As of December31, 2003, we had commitments
under these vendor contracts which aggregated approximately
$872million related to the provision of equipment,
services and other support.   
Executive Agreements One of our executives is party to an employment
agreement which provides for, among other things, the payment of
severance and other benefits upon the termination of the
executive without cause or for good reason as defined in such
agreement. Certain other executives are party to
change-in-control severance agreements, which provide for
payment of severance and other benefits in the event of an
involuntary termination of the executives employment as
defined in such agreements within three years after a change in
control of Hughes Electronics. As a change in control of Hughes
Electronics occurred on December22, 2003, these agreements
will apply if an involuntary termination of the executive occurs
on or before December22, 2006. If all of these executives
receive the termination related benefits as specified by their
respective agreements, the aggregate cost to us would be in the
range of $90 million to $110 million. Certain of our other executives have
change-in-control severance agreements, which provide for, among
other things, the payment of severance and other benefits upon
an involuntary termination of the executives employment
within three years after a change in control of PanAmSat, as
defined in their respective agreements. These agreements expire
if no change in control of PanAmSat has occurred on or before
December31, 2004.   
Other Boeing Satellite Systems, Inc., formerly Hughes
Space and Communications Company, has security interests in
certain transponders on our PAS-2, PAS-3, PAS-4 and PAS-5
satellites to secure incentive payments owed by us pursuant to
satellite construction contracts. We are involved in litigation in the normal
course of our operations. Management does not believe the
outcome of such matters will have a material effect on the
consolidated financial statements. 104 Table of Contents PANAMSAT CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
