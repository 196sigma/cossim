Management of CSG Systems International, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f or 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: i
Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; ii
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and iii
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. 
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework 2013. 
Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
CSG Systems International, Inc.: 
We have audited CSG Systems International, Inc.s the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. CSG Systems International Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In our opinion, CSG Systems International, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

47 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
General

We are a business support solutions provider primarily serving the communications industry. Our broad suite of solutions helps our clients improve their business operations by creating more compelling product offerings and an enhanced customer experience through more relevant and targeted interactions, while at the same time, more efficiently managing the service providers cost structure.

Our suite of solutions includes revenue management, content management and monetization, and customer interaction management. We are a SP SmallCap 600 company. 
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted GAAP in the United States U.S. 2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Principles of Consolidation. Our Financial Statements include all of our accounts and our subsidiaries accounts. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
Translation of Foreign Currency. Our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency of the countries in which they operate as their functional currency. Their assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues, expenses, and cash flows are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. Foreign currency translation adjustments are included in comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the determination of net income. 
Use of Estimates in Preparation of Our Financial Statements. The preparation of our Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The more critical estimates and related assumptions that affect our financial position and results of operations are in the areas of: irevenue recognition; iiallowance for doubtful accounts receivable; iiiimpairment assessments of goodwill and other long-lived assets; ivincome taxes; vbusiness combinations and asset purchases; and viloss contingencies. 
Revenue Recognition. We use various judgments and estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. Our primary revenue recognition criteria include: ipersuasive evidence of an arrangement; iidelivery; iiifixed or determinable fees; and ivcollectibility of fees. 
Processing and Related Services. 
Our processing and related services revenue relates to: i our cloud-based, revenue management and content monetization solutions, and various related services; and ii our managed services offering in which we operate software solutions primarily our software solutions on behalf of our clients.
We contract for our cloud-based processing and related services using long-term agreements whose terms have typically ranged from three to ten years. The long-term processing agreements include multiple services delivered each month, to include such things as: i revenuebilling and data processing services; iibusiness support services e.g., workforce management tools, consumer credit verifications, etc.; iii content monetization and delivery functions; and ivcustomer statement invoice printing and mailing services. The fees for these deliverables typically are billed to our clients monthly based upon actual monthly volumes and/or usage of services e.g., the number of client customers processed on our systems, the number of transactions processed on our systems, and/or the quantity and content of the monthly statements and mailings processed through our systems or on a fixed monthly fee. We recognize processing and related services revenue on a monthly basis as we provide the services. 
We contract for our managed services using long-term arrangements whose terms have ranged from three to eight years.Under managed services agreements, we may operate software products primarily our software solutions on behalf of our clients: i out of a clients data center; ii out of a data center we own and operate; or iii out of a third-party data center we contract with for such services. Managed services can also include us providing other services, such as transitional services, fulfillment, remittance processing, operational consulting, back office, and end user billing services.
48 Software and Services. 
Our software and services revenue relates primarily to: isoftware license sales; and iiprofessional services to implement the software. 
The accounting for software license arrangements, especially when software is sold in a multiple-element arrangement, can be complex and requires considerable judgment. Key factors considered in accounting for software license and related services include the following criteria: ithe identification of the separate elements of the arrangement; iithe determination of whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements; iiithe assessment of whether the software, if hosted, should be accounted for as a services arrangement and thus outside the scope of the software revenue recognition literature; ivthe determination of vendor specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value for the undelivered elements of the arrangement; vthe assessment of whether the software license fees are fixed or determinable; vithe determination as to whether the fees are considered collectible; and viithe assessment of whether services included in the arrangement represent significant production, customization or modification of the software. The evaluation of these factors, and the ultimate revenue recognition decision, requires significant judgments to be made by us. The judgments made in this area could have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by changing the amount and/or the timing of the revenue recognized. In addition, because software licenses typically have little or no direct, incremental costs related to the recognition of the revenue, these judgments could also have a significant effect on our results of operations. 
The initial sale of software products generally requires significant production, modification or customization and thus falls under the guidelines of contract accounting. In these software license arrangements, the elements of the arrangements are typically a software license, professional services, and maintenance. When we have VSOE of fair value for the maintenance, which we generally do, we allocate a portion of the total arrangement fee to the maintenance element based on its VSOE of fair value, and the balance of the arrangement fee is subject to contract accounting using the percentage-of-completion POC method of accounting. Under the POC method of accounting, software license and professional services revenues are typically recognized as the professional services related to the software implementation project are performed. We are using hours performed on the project as the measure to determine the percentage of the work completed. 
In certain instances, we sell software license volume upgrades, which provide our clients the right to use our software to process higher transaction volume levels. In these instances, if: i maintenance is the only undelivered element of the software arrangement; iiwe have VSOE of fair value for the maintenance related to the volume upgrade; and iiiwe meet the other revenue recognition criteria, we recognize the software license revenue on the effective date of the volume upgrade. 
A portion of our professional services revenues does not include an element of software delivery e.g., business consulting services, etc., and thus, do not fall within the scope of specific authoritative accounting literature for software arrangements. In these cases, revenues from fixed-price, professional service contracts are recognized using a method consistent with the proportional performance method, which is relatively consistent with our POC methodology. Under a proportional performance model, revenue is recognized by allocating revenue between reporting periods based on relative service provided in each reporting period, and costs are generally recognized as incurred. We utilize an input-based approach i.e., hours worked for purposes of measuring performance on these types of contracts. Our input measure is considered a reasonable surrogate for an output measure. In instances when the work performed on fixed price agreements is of relatively short duration, or if we are unable to make reasonably dependable estimates at the outset of the arrangement, we use the completed contract method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized when the work is completed. 
Our use of the POC and proportional performance methods of accounting on professional services engagements requires estimates of the total project revenues, total project costs and the expected hours necessary to complete a project. Changes in estimates as a result of additional information or experience on a project as work progresses are inherent characteristics of the POC and proportional performance methods of accounting as we are exposed to various business risks in completing these engagements. The estimation process to support these methods of accounting is more difficult for projects of greater length and/or complexity. The judgments and estimates made in this area could: ihave a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by changing the amount and/or the timing of the revenue recognized; and/or iiimpact the expected profitability of a project, including whether an overall loss on an arrangement has occurred. To mitigate the inherent risks in using the POC and proportional performance methods of accounting, we track our performance on projects and reevaluate the appropriateness of our estimates as part of our monthly accounting cycle. 
Revenues from professional services contracts billed on a time-and-materials basis are recognized as the services are performed and as amounts due from clients are deemed collectible and contractually non-refundable. 
Maintenance. 
Our maintenance revenue relates primarily to support of our software once it has been implemented.Maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the software maintenance period. Our maintenance consists primarily of client and product support, technical updates e.g., bug fixes, etc., and unspecified upgrades or enhancements to our software products. If specified upgrades or enhancements are offered in an arrangement, which is rare, they are accounted for as a separate element of the software arrangement. 
49 Deferred Revenue and Unbilled Accounts Receivable. Client payments and billed amounts due from clients in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. Deferred revenue amounts expected to be recognized within the next twelve months are classified as current liabilities. Revenue recognized prior to the scheduled billing date is recorded as unbilled accounts receivable. 
Postage. We pass through to our clients the cost of postage that is incurred on behalf of those clients, and typically require an advance payment on expected postage costs. These advance payments are included in client deposits in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets Balance Sheets or Balance Sheet and are classified as current liabilities regardless of the contract period. We net the cost of postage against the postage reimbursements for those clients where we require advance deposits, and include the net amount which is not material in processing and related services revenues.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of December31, 2015 and 2014, our cash equivalents consist primarily of institutional money market funds, commercial paper, and time deposits held at major banks. 
As of December31, 2015 and 2014, we had $50 million and $47 million, respectively, of restricted cash that serves to collateralize outstanding letters of credit. This restricted cash is included in cash and cash equivalents in our Balance Sheet. 
Short-term Investments and Other Financial Instruments. Our financial instruments as of December31, 2015 and 2014 include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and debt. Because of their short maturities, the carrying amounts of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate their fair value. 
Our short-term investments and certain of our cash equivalents are considered available-for-sale and are reported at fair value in our Balance Sheets, with unrealized gains and losses, net of the related income tax effect, excluded from earnings and reported in a separate component of stockholders equity. Realized and unrealized gains and losses were not material in any period presented. 
Primarily all short-term investments held by us as of December31, 2015 and 2014 have contractual maturities of less than two years from the time of acquisition. Our short-term investments at December31, 2015 and 2014 consisted almost entirely of fixed income securities. Proceeds from the sale/maturity of short-term investments in 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $1930 million, $1975 million, and $897 million, respectively. 
The following table represents the fair value hierarchy based upon three levels of inputs, of which Levels 1 and 2 are considered observable and Level 3 is unobservable, for our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in thousands: December31, 2015 December31, 2014 Level1 Level2 Total Level 1 Level 2 Total Assets Cash equivalents Money market funds 35,730 35,730 9,785 9,785 Commercial paper 63,890 63,890 12,248 12,248 Short-term investments Corporate debt securities 31,253 31,253 88,494 88,494 Municipal bonds 2,763 2,763 9,945 9,945 U.S. government agency bonds 16,201 16,201 11,313 11,313 Asset-backed securities 11,443 11,443 10,336 10,336 Total 35,730 125,550 161,280 9,785 132,336 142,121 Valuation inputs used to measure the fair values of our money market funds were derived from quoted market prices. The fair values of all other financial instruments are based upon pricing provided by third-party pricing services. These prices were derived from observable market inputs. 50 We have chosen not to measure our debt at fair value, with changes recognized in earnings each reporting period. The following table indicates the carrying value and estimated fair value of our debt as of the indicated periods in thousands: December31, 2015 December31, 2014 CarryingValue FairValue CarryingValue FairValue Credit Agreement carrying value including current maturities 142,500 142,500 120,000 120,000 Convertible debt par value 150,000 237,900 150,000 178,920 The fair value for our Credit Agreement was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology, while the fair value for our convertible debt was estimated based upon quoted market prices or recent sales activity, both of which are considered Level 2 inputs.See Note 5 for discussion regarding an amendment to our Credit Agreement. 
Concentrations of Credit Risk. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to credit risk. The principal concentrations of credit risk relate to cash deposits, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable. We regularly monitor credit risk exposures and take steps to mitigate the likelihood of these exposures resulting in a loss. We hold our cash deposits, cash equivalents, and short-term investments with financial institutions we believe to be of sound financial condition. 
We generally do not require collateral or other security to support accounts receivable. We evaluate the credit worthiness of our clients in conjunction with our revenue recognition processes, as well as through our ongoing collectibility assessment processes for accounts receivable. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific clients, historical trends, and other information. We use various judgments and estimates in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable. See Note 3 for additional details of our concentration of accounts receivable. 
The activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is as follows in thousands: 2015 2014 2013 Balance, beginning of year 3,323 2,359 3,147 Additions reductions to expense 533 1,406 354 Write-offs 318 465 280 Recoveries 89 Other 27 23 154 Balance, end of year 3,600 3,323 2,359 Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost or at estimated fair value if acquired in a business combination and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their economic life or the lease term. Depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. Depreciation expense for all property and equipment is reflected in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income Income Statements separately in the aggregate and is not included in the cost of revenues or the other components of operating expenses. Depreciation for income tax purposes is computed using accelerated methods. 
Software. We expend substantial amounts on RD, particularly for new products and services, or for enhancements of existing products and services. For development of software products that are to be licensed by us, we expense all costs related to the development of the software until technological feasibility is established. For development of software to be used internally e.g., processing systems software, we expense all costs prior to the application development stage. 
During 2015, 2014, and 2013, we expended $1020 million, $1047 million, and $1100 million, respectively, on RD projects. We did not capitalize any RD costs in 2015, 2014, or 2013, as the costs subject to capitalization during these periods were not material. We did not have any capitalized RD costs included in our December31, 2015 or 2014 Balance Sheets. 
Realizability of Long-Lived Assets. We evaluate our long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset is impaired if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with that asset are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. If deemed impaired, the long-lived asset is written down to its fair value. 51 Goodwill. We evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis. In addition, we evaluate our goodwill on a more periodic basis e.g., quarterly if events occur or circumstances change that could indicate a potential impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit which includes the goodwill is greater than the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. 
Contingencies. We accrue for a loss contingency when: iit is probable that an asset has been impaired, or a liability has been incurred; and iithe amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The determination of accounting for loss contingencies is subject to various judgments and estimates. We do not record the benefit from a gain contingency until the benefit is realized. 
Earnings Per Common Share EPS. Basic and diluted EPS amounts are presented on the face of our Income Statements. 
No reconciliation of the basic and diluted EPS numerators is necessary as net income is used as the numerators for all periods presented. The reconciliation of the basic and diluted EPS denominators related to the common shares is included in the following table in thousands: 2015 2014 2013 Basic weighted-average common shares 31,051 32,449 32,117 Dilutive effect of common stock options 1 Dilutive effect of restricted common stock 624 569 550 Dilutive effect of 2010 Convertible Notes 1,633 717 205 Dilutive effect of Stock Warrants 130 1 Diluted weighted-average common shares 33,438 33,736 32,873 In 2015, we repurchased 18 million shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program.
The 2010 Convertible Notes have a dilutive effect in those quarterly periods in which our average stock price exceeds the current effective conversion price see Note 5. 
The Stock Warrants have a dilutive effect in those quarterly periods in which our average stock price exceeds the exercise price of $2668 per warrant under the treasury stock method, and are not subject to performance vesting conditions see Note 10.
Potentially dilutive common shares related to stock options, unvested restricted stock, and Stock Warrants excluded from the computation of diluted EPS, as the effect was antidilutive, were not material in any period presented.
Stock-Based Compensation. Stock-based compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted to employees and non-employee directors. We measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date of the award, based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognize the cost net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period. Benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense, if any, are reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as an operating cash inflow. 
Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Accounting Pronouncement Issued But Not Yet Effective. The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606.This ASU is a single comprehensive model which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.Under the new guidance, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services.The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606:Deferral of the Effective Date which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year.The updated accounting guidance is now effective for annual and interim reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.Early adoption is permitted.An entity may choose to adopt this ASU either retrospectively or through a cumulative effect adjustment as of the start of the first period for which it applies the standard. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on our Financial Statements and our method of adoption.
52 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest Subtopic 835-30.This ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a reduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This ASU is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and must be applied retrospectively.We expect to reclassify these balance sheet amounts upon adoption in 2016.
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes Topic 740.This ASU requires deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent.Existing guidance requires us to record deferred tax balances as either current or non-current in accordance with the classification of the underlying attributes. This ASU is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.The ASU may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented.We expect to adopt this ASU retrospectively in 2016.While this new standard will not change the manner in which we calculate our deferred tax assets or liabilities, it will result in reclassifications on our Balance Sheet. 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases Topic 842.This ASU requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-to-use asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than twelve months on its balance sheet.This ASU is effective in annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and requires a modified retrospective transition method.We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on our Financial Statements. 3.
Segment Reporting and Significant Concentration
Segment Information. We have evaluated how our chief operating decision maker has organized our company for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance, and have concluded that as of December31, 2015, we have one reportable segment. 
Products and Services. Our products and services help companies with complex transaction-centric business models manage the opportunities and challenges associated with accurately capturing, managing, generating, and optimizing the revenue associated with the immense volumes of customer interactions and then manage the intricate nature of those customer relationships. Our core billing and customer care platform, Advanced Convergent Platform ACP, is a pre-integrated cloud-based platform. We generate a substantial percentage of our revenues by providing our ACP processing and customer interaction management solutions, and related software products e.g., Advanced Customer Service Representative, Workforce Express, etc. to the North American cable and satellite markets. Additionally, we license certain software products e.g., WBMS, TSM, and Singleview and provide our professional services to implement, configure and maintain these software products, and allow clients to effectively roll out new products as well as attract and retain customers. 
Geographic Regions. For 2015 and 2014, 84% and 85%, respectively, of our revenues were attributable to our operations in the Americas. We use the location of the client as the basis of attributing revenues to individual regions. 
Financial information relating to our operations by geographic region is as follows in thousands: 
Total Revenues 2015 2014 2013 Americas principally the U.S. 634,389 636,482 633,163 Europe, Middle East and Africa principally Europe 78,711 79,535 80,527 Asia Pacific 39,420 35,269 33,778 Total revenues 752,520 751,286 747,468 Property and Equipment AsofDecember31 2015 2014 Americas principally the U.S. 29,052 31,912 Europe, Middle East and Africa 3,879 3,618 Asia Pacific 3,061 2,796 Total property and equipment 35,992 38,326 53 Significant Clients and Industry Concentration. A large percentage of our historical revenues have been generated from our largest clients, which are Comcast Corporation Comcast, DISH Network Corporation DISH, and Time Warner Cable Inc. Time Warner. 
Revenues from these clients represented the following percentages of our total revenues for the following years: 2015 2014 2013 Comcast 24 22 19 DISH 14 15 15 Time Warner 12 11 11 As of December31, 2015 and 2014, the percentage of net billed accounts receivable balances attributable to these clients were as follows: AsofDecember31 2015 2014 Comcast 30 21 DISH 13 13 Time Warner 8 12 We expect to continue to generate a significant percentage of our future revenues from a limited number of clients, including Comcast, DISH, and Time Warner. There are inherent risks whenever a large percentage of total revenues are concentrated with a limited number of clients. Should a significant client: iterminate or fail to renew their contracts with us, in whole or in part for any reason; iisignificantly reduce the number of customer accounts processed on our solutions, the price paid for our services, or the scope of services that we provide; or iiiexperience significant financial or operating difficulties, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. 4.
Long-Lived Assets 
Property and Equipment. Property and equipment at December31 consisted of the following in thousands, except years: UsefulLivesyears 2015 2014 Computer equipment 3-5 70,408 96,749 Leasehold improvements 5-10 15,226 16,566 Operating equipment 3-8 53,494 55,501 Furniture and fixtures 8 9,146 7,531 Capital projects in process 44 148,274 176,391 Lessaccumulated depreciation 112,282 138,065 Property and equipment, net 35,992 38,326 Goodwill. We do not have any intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill. A rollforward of goodwill in 2015 and 2014 is as follows in thousands: January1, 2014 balance 233,599 Revisions related to prior acquisitions 59 Effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 8,271 December31, 2014 balance 225,269 Revisions related to prior acquisitions 60 Effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 5,485 December31, 2015 balance 219,724 54 Other Intangible Assets. Our intangible assets subject to ongoing amortization consist of client contracts and software. 
Client Contracts 
Client contracts consist of the following: iinvestments in client contracts; iidirect and incremental costs that we have capitalized related to contractual arrangements where we have deferred revenues to convert or set-up client customers onto our outsourced solutions; and iiiclient contracts acquired in business combinations. 
As of December31, 2015 and 2014, the carrying values of these assets were as follows in thousands: 2015 2014 GrossCarryingAmount AccumulatedAmortization NetAmount GrossCarryingAmount AccumulatedAmortization NetAmount Investments in client contracts 1 25,176 17,060 8,116 34,657 23,907 10,750 Capitalized costs 2 10,868 2,489 8,379 6,667 3,463 3,204 Acquired client contracts 3 91,584 68,341 23,243 94,164 61,215 32,949 Total client contracts 127,628 87,890 39,738 135,488 88,585 46,903 The aggregate amortization related to client contracts included in our operations for 2015, 2014, and 2013, was as follows in thousands: 2015 2014 2013 Investments in client contracts 1 5,165 6,409 6,181 Capitalized costs 2 1,334 1,007 2,365 Acquired client contracts 3 8,902 11,951 14,999 Total client contracts 15,401 19,367 23,545 1
Investments in client contracts consist principally of incentives provided to new or existing clients to convert their customer accounts to, or retain their customers accounts on, our customer care and billing systems. Investments in client contracts related to client incentives are amortized ratably over the lives of the respective client contracts, which as of December31, 2015, have termination dates that range from 2016 through 2020. Amortization of the investments in client contracts related to client incentives is reflected as a reduction in processing and related services revenues in our Income Statements. 2
Capitalized costs related to client conversion/set-up services related to long-term processing or managed services arrangements are generally amortized proportionately over the contract period that the processing or managed services are expected to be provided, and are primarily reflected in cost of processing and related services in our Income Statements. 3
Acquired client contracts represent assets acquired in our prior business acquisitions. Acquired client contracts are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from five to ten years based on the approximate pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are expected to be realized. Classification of the amortization of acquired client contracts generally follows where the acquired business cost of revenues are categorized in our Income Statements. 
The weighted-average remaining amortization period of client contracts as of December31, 2015 was approximately 50 months. Based on the December31, 2015 net carrying value of these intangible assets, the estimated amortization for each of the five succeeding fiscal years ending December31 will be: 2016 $133 million; 2017 $97 million; 2018 $79 million; 2019 $56 million; and 2020 $27 million. 55 Software 
Software consists of: isoftware and similar intellectual property rights from various business combinations; and iiinternal use software. 
As of December31, 2015 and 2014, the carrying values of these assets were as follows in thousands: 2015 2014 GrossCarryingAmount AccumulatedAmortization NetAmount GrossCarryingAmount AccumulatedAmortization NetAmount Acquired software 4 66,798 61,475 5,323 67,012 56,806 10,206 Internal use software 5 63,391 33,619 29,772 64,517 29,991 34,526 Total software 130,189 95,094 35,095 131,529 86,797 44,732 The aggregate amortization related to software included in our operations for 2015, 2014, and 2013, was as follows in thousands: 2015 2014 2013 Acquired software 4 3,081 3,457 4,221 Internal use software 5 8,048 8,404 7,633 Total software 11,129 11,861 11,854 4
Acquired software represents the software intangible assets acquired in our prior business acquisitions, which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from five to ten years. 5
Internal use software represents: ithird-party software licenses; and iithe internal and external costs related to the implementation of the third-party software licenses. Internal use software is amortized over its estimated useful life ranging from twelve months to ten years. 
The weighted-average remaining amortization period of the software intangible assets as of December31, 2015 was approximately 70 months. Based on the December31, 2015 net carrying value of these intangible assets, the estimated amortization for each of the five succeeding fiscal years ending December31 will be: 2016 $86 million; 2017 $70 million; 2018 $55 million; 2019 $40 million; and 2020 $29 million. 5.
Debt 
As of December31, 2015 and 2014, our long-term debt was as follows in thousands: 2015 2014 2015 Credit Agreement Term loan, due February 2020, interest at adjusted LIBOR plus 175% combined rate of 236% at December 31, 2015 142,500 200 million revolving loan facility, due February 2020, interest at adjusted LIBOR plus applicable margin 2012 Credit Agreement Term loan, due November 2017 or December 2016 if certain conditions exist, interest at adjusted LIBOR plus 200% combined rate of 225% at December31, 2014 120,000 100 million revolving loan facility, due November 2017 or December 2016 if certain conditions exist, interest at adjusted LIBOR plus applicable margin Convertible Debt Securities 2010 Convertible Notes senior subordinated convertible notes; due March1, 2017; cash interest at 30%; net of unamortized OID of $7,923 and $14,169, respectively 142,077 135,831 284,577 255,831 Current portion of long-term debt 149,577 22,500 Total long-term debt, net 135,000 233,331 56 2015 Credit Agreement. In February 2015, we entered into an amended and restated $350 million credit agreement with several financial institutions the 2015 Credit Agreement to replace the 2012 Credit Agreement.The key benefits of this refinancing include:i an increase in the tenor of the loan from November 2017 to February 2020; ii an increase in the amount of the revolving loan facility from $100 million to $200 million; iii a reduction in the interest rate and other fees; and iv financial and other restrictive covenants that are better or equal to that of the 2012 Credit Agreement.
The 2015 Credit Agreement provides borrowings in the form of:i a $150 million aggregate principal five-year term loan the 2015 Term Loan; and ii a $200 million aggregate principal five-year revolving loan facility the 2015 Revolver.With the $150 million proceeds from the 2015 Term Loan, we repaid the outstanding $120 million balance from term loan under the 2012 Credit Agreement, resulting in a net increase of available cash by $30 million, a portion of which was used to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the refinancing. 
The interest rates under the 2015 Credit Agreement are based upon our choice of an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 175% - 275%, or an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of 075% -175%, with the applicable margin, depending on our then-net secured total leverage ratio.We will pay a commitment fee of 0250% - 0375% of the average daily unused amount of the 2015 Revolver, with the commitment fee rate also dependent upon our then-net secured total leverage ratio.As of December 31, 2015, our interest rate on the 2015 Term Loan is 236% adjusted LIBOR plus 175% per annum, effective through March 31, 2016, and our commitment fee on the unused 2015 Revolver is 025%.As of December 31, 2015, we had no borrowing outstanding on our 2015 Revolver and had the entire $200 million available to us.
The 2015 Credit Agreement includes mandatory repayments of the aggregate principal amount of the 2015 Term Loan payable quarterly for the first 5% of total, second 5% of total, third 10% of total, fourth 15% of total, and fifth years 15% of total, with the remaining principal balance due at maturity 50% of total.The 2015 Credit Agreement has no prepayment penalties and requires mandatory repayments under certain circumstances, including:i asset sales or casualty proceeds; and ii proceeds of debt or preferred stock issuances.
The 2015 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants.In addition, the 2015 Credit Agreement has customary negative covenants that places limits on our ability to:i incur additional indebtedness; ii create liens on its property; iii make investments; iv enter into mergers and consolidations; v sell assets; vi declare dividends or repurchase shares; vii engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and viii prepay certain indebtedness; and ix issue capital stock of subsidiaries.We must also meet certain financial covenants to include:i a maximum total leverage ratio; ii a maximum secured leverage ratio; iii a minimum interest coverage ratio; and iv a limitation on capital expenditures.As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the financial ratios and other covenants related to the 2015 Credit Agreement.
In conjunction with the 2015 Credit Agreement, we have pledged assets under a security agreement in favor of a financial institution as collateral agent the Security Agreement.Under the Security Agreement and 2015 Credit Agreement, all of CSGs domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed its obligations, and CSG and such subsidiaries have pledged substantially all of its assets to secure the obligations under the 2015 Credit Agreement and such guarantees. 
In conjunction with the closing of the 2015 Credit Agreement, we incurred financing costs of $27 million. When combined with the remaining deferred financing costs for the 2012 Credit Agreement, financing costs of $59 million have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the related term of the 2015 Credit Agreement, and financing costs of $09 million were recorded in interest expense.
2012 Credit Agreement. In 2012, we entered into an amended and restated $250 million credit agreement with several financial institutions the 2012 Credit Agreement. The 2012 Credit Agreement provided borrowings by us in the form of: ia $150 million aggregate principal five-year term loan the 2012 Term Loan; and iia $100 million aggregate principal five-year revolving loan facility the 2012 Revolver.  
The interest rates under the 2012 Credit Agreement were based upon our choice of an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 200% - 275%, or an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of 100% - 175%, depending on our then-current leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2014, our combined interest rate LIBOR plus applicable margin for the 2012 Term Loan was 225% per annum.
2010 Convertible Notes. In 2010, we completed an offering of $150 million of 30% senior subordinated convertible notes due March1, 2017 the 2010 Convertible Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2010 Convertible Notes are unsecured obligations, subordinated to any future senior indebtedness and senior to any future junior subordinated debt. The 2010 Convertible Notes were issued at a price of 100% of their par value and bear interest at a rate of 30%per annum, which is payable semiannually in arrears on March1 and September1 of each year. The 2010 Convertible Notes contain customary affirmative covenants, including compliance with terms of certain other indebtedness of the Company over a defined threshold amount. 
57 The 2010 Convertible Notes are convertible into our common stock, under the specified conditions and settlement terms outlined below.As a result of us declaring a quarterly cash dividend beginning in June 2013, the conversion rate has also been adjusted quarterly.As of December 31, 2015, the conversion rate was 435933 shares of our common stock per $1,000 par value of the 2010 Convertible Notes equivalent to a conversion price of $2294 per share of our common stock. The Indenture related to the 2010 Convertible Notes Notes Indenture includes anti-dilution provisions for the holders such that the conversion rate and thus the initial conversion price can be adjusted in the future for certain events, to include stock dividends, the issuance of rights, options or warrants to purchase our common stock at a price below the then-current market price, and certain distributions of common stock, property or rights, options or warrants to acquire our common stock to all or substantially all holders of our common stock. Additionally, the conversion rate may be adjusted prior to the maturity date in connection with the occurrence of specified corporate transactions for a make-whole premium as set forth in the Notes Indenture. 
Prior to September1, 2016, holders of the 2010 Convertible Notes can convert their securities: iat any time the price of our common stock trades over $2982 per share 130% of the $2294 conversion price for a specified period of time; iiat any time the trading price of the 2010 Convertible Notes falls below 98% of the average conversion value for the 2010 Convertible Notes for a specified period of time; and iiiat any time upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions, to include a change of control as defined in the Notes Indenture. On or after September1, 2016, the holders of the 2010 Convertible Notes can elect to convert their securities at any time, with the settlement occurring on March1, 2017. As of December 16, 2015, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the conversion price for the required period, thus allowing the 2010 Convertible Notes to be converted at the holders option during the quarter beginning January 1, 2016 and ending March 31, 2016. 
Upon any conversion of the 2010 Convertible Notes, we will settle our conversion obligation as follows: iwe will pay cash for 100% of the par value of the 2010 Convertible Notes that are converted; and iito the extent the value of our conversion obligation exceeds the par value, we will satisfy the remaining conversion obligation in our common stock, cash or any combination of our common stock and cash.Based on our December 31, 2015 closing stock price of $3598 per share, the 2010 Convertible Notes would have had a total settlement value of approximately $235 million.
As the 2010 Convertible Notes can be converted at the holders option during the quarter beginning January 1, 2016 and ending March 31, 2016, the net carrying value of the 2010 Convertible Notes of $1421 million has been classified as a current liability in our Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015. 
The OID related to the 2010 Convertible Notes of $384 million, as a result of an effective interest rate of the liability component of 775% compared to the cash interest rate of 30%, is being amortized to interest expense through March1, 2017, the maturity date of the 2010 Convertible Notes. 
Estimated Maturities on Long-Term Debt. 
As of December 31, 2015, the maturities of our long-term debt, based upon: 1the mandatory repayment schedule for the 2015 Term Loan; and 2the convertibility of the 2010 Convertible Notes beginning January 1, 2016 and ending March 31, 2016, was as follows in thousands: 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2015 Term Loan 7,500 15,000 22,500 22,500 75,000 2010 Convertible Notes 150,000 Total long-term debt repayments 157,500 15,000 22,500 22,500 75,000 Deferred Financing Costs. As of December31, 2015, net deferred financing costs related to the 2015 Credit Agreement were $47 million, and are being amortized to interest expense over the related term of the 2015 Credit Agreement through February 2020. As of December31, 2015, net deferred financing costs related to the 2010 Convertible Notes were $07 million, and are being amortized to interest expense through maturity March 2017. The net deferred financing costs are reflected in Other Assets in our Balance Sheets. Interest expense for 2015, 2014, and 2013 includes amortization of deferred financing costs of $19 million, $25 million, and $26 million, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate on our debt borrowings, including amortization of OID, amortization of deferred financing costs, and commitment fees on a revolving loan facility, for 2015, 2014, and 2013, was approximately 6%, 6%, and 5%, respectively. 58 6.
Restructuring and Reorganization Charges 
Restructuring and reorganization charges are expenses that generally result from cost reduction initiatives and/or significant changes to our business, to include such things as involuntary employee terminations, changes in management structure, divestitures of businesses, facility consolidations and abandonments, impairment of acquired intangible assets, and fundamental reorganizations impacting operational focus and direction.The following are the key restructuring and reorganizational activities we incurred over the last three years that have impacted our results from operations: 
During 2013 we implemented the following restructuring activities We reduced our workforce by approximately 160 employees worldwide.These actions were taken to further align our workforce around our near- and long-term business opportunities. As a result, we incurred restructuring charges related to these involuntary terminations of $56 million. We disposed of a small print operation and our marketing analytics business, resulting in $36 million of restructuring charges, including a $3 million loss from the sale. We terminated our previously frozen defined benefit pension plan resulting in $32 million of restructuring expense.
During 2014 we implemented the following restructuring and reorganization activities In conjunction with the reorganization of our Content Direct solution to facilitate its integration with our other offerings, we terminated an incentive arrangement with certain employees to develop and then grow our Content Direct solution the Arrangement in exchange for a one-time cash payment of $80 million, which was reflected as a reorganization charge in 2014. The Arrangement included certain liquidation options for the employees in the event of a change of control of the Content Direct solution. We reduced our workforce by approximately 60 employees worldwide, to further align our workforce around our near- and long-term business opportunities.As a result, we recorded restructuring expense of $56 million. We abandoned space at two of our locations to improve our space utilization, resulting in a restructuring charge of $11 million. 
During 2015 we implemented the following restructuring activities We reduced our workforce by approximately 160 employees worldwide.These actions were primarily taken to consolidate delivery centers and better align our spending levels with our revenue opportunities.We incurred restructuring charges related to these involuntary terminations of $45 million. These actions also led to the discontinuance of certain non-essential products, resulting in an asset impairment charge of $17 million. We abandoned space at five of our locations as a result of workforce reductions and improvements in our space utilization, resulting in restructuring charges of $12 million. We entered into an agreement the Agreement with certain former management personnel for the sale of our cyber-security business marketed under the Invotas brand, resulting in a reduction in restructuring charges of $37 million related to the gain on the sale.
In February 2016, this business was acquired by a third-party.Based on the terms of the Agreement, we have received additional proceeds which were contingent upon a liquidation event, as defined in the Agreement, resulting in an additional gain on the sale of approximately $66 million. The additional contingent gain on sale will reduce restructuring charges, if any, in the first quarter of 2016. 
The activities discussed above resulted in total charges for 2015, 2014, and 2013 of $31 million, $140 million, and $124 million, respectively, which have been reflected as a separate line item in our Income Statements. 59 The activity in the business restructuring and reorganization reserves during 2015, 2014, and 2013 is as follows in thousands: TerminationBenefits FacilitiesAbandonment Disposition of Business Operations Other Total January 1, 2013, balance 1,917 453 2,370 Charged to expense during year 5,577 3,588 3,240 12,405 Cash payments 3,741 571 19 4,331 Adjustment for the loss on the disposition of business operations 3,017 3,017 Adjustment for the loss on termination of pension plan 3,221 3,221 Other 36 453 489 December31, 2013, balance 3,717 3,717 Charged to expense during year 5,589 1,146 222 7,456 13,969 Cash payments 6,421 8,000 14,421 Adjustment for the gain on the disposition of business operations 222 222 Other 66 33 560 461 December31, 2014, balance 2,819 1,113 16 3,948 Charged to expense during year 4,544 1,175 3,733 1,088 3,074 Cash payments 5,694 405 30 6,129 Adjustment for the gain on the disposition of business operations 3,733 3,733 Adjustment for asset impairment 1,685 1,685 Other 32 526 611 53 December31, 2015, balance 1,637 1,357 2,994 As of December31, 2015, $21 million of the business restructuring and reorganization reserves were included in current liabilities. 7.
Income Taxes 
Income Tax Provision/Benefit. The components of net income from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows in thousands: 2015 2014 2013 Domestic 93,390 70,737 63,278 Foreign 2,951 9,215 1,759 Total 96,341 61,522 61,519 The income tax provision related to continuing operations consists of the following in thousands: 2015 2014 2013 Current Federal 41,002 20,374 12,880 State 5,227 2,443 916 Foreign 3,651 2,953 4,273 49,880 25,770 18,069 Deferred Federal 14,611 1,139 1,130 State 1,147 837 2,329 Foreign 348 1,935 5,277 16,106 41 1,818 Total income tax provision 33,774 25,811 16,251 60 The difference between our income tax provision computed at the statutory Federal income tax rate and our financial statement income tax related to continuing operations is summarized as follows in thousands: 2015 2014 2013 Provision at Federal rate of 35 33,719 21,533 21,532 State income taxes, net of Federal impact 2,652 2,132 2,109 Research and experimentation credits 2,135 450 5,754 Tax uncertainties 166 187 269 Section199 manufacturing deduction 2,884 1,936 2,263 Foreign rate differential 688 2,847 1,133 Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 919 3,602 3,312 Other impact of foreign operations 283 3,555 2,088 Other 698 1,451 987 Total income tax provision 33,774 25,811 16,251 We have undistributed earnings of approximately $40 million from certain foreign subsidiaries. We intend to indefinitely reinvest these foreign earnings, therefore, a provision has not been made for income taxes that might be payable upon remittance of such earnings. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings is not practicable because of the complexities of the hypothetical calculation.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, we corrected our Financial Statements for an error in the calculation of our research and experimentation income tax credit RD credit amount recorded within our 2014, 2013, and 2012 income tax provisions.The error, which relates to the 2009 2014 tax years, resulted in the understatement of income tax expense and the overstatement of the net income tax receivable of $12 million, $61 million, and $18 million for each of years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 2013 beginning accumulated earnings, respectively.Due to the timing of claims for certain of the RD credit amounts, the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 included the income tax benefits related to not only 2013, but the change in estimate of certain incremental RD credits claimed for development activities generated in 2009, 2010, and 2012.In none of the individual 2009 2014 tax years did the amount of the RD credit error exceed $19 million.We assessed the materiality of the error in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, Materiality, and determined that the error was immaterial to previously reported amounts contained in our annual report.
Deferred Income Taxes. Net deferred income tax liabilities as of December31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows in thousands: 2015 2014 Deferred income tax assets 77,270 77,201 Deferred income tax liabilities 42,576 55,045 Valuation allowance 17,414 20,507 Net deferred income tax assets 17,280 1,649 61 The components of our net deferred income tax assets liabilities as of December31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows in thousands: 2015 2014 Net current deferred income tax assets Accrued expenses and reserves 14,001 10,221 Stock-based compensation 5,528 4,425 Total current deferred income tax assets 19,529 14,646 Less: valuation allowance 1,394 1,442 Net current deferred income tax assets 18,135 13,204 Net non-current deferred income tax assets Software 412 809 Client contracts and related intangibles 2,914 5,252 Net operating loss carryforwards 15,688 18,527 Property and equipment 7,975 11,470 Deferred revenue 914 550 Facility abandonment 143 262 Other 877 305 Total non-current deferred income tax assets 23,095 26,671 Less: valuation allowance 14,713 17,781 Net non-current deferred income tax assets 8,382 8,890 Net non-current deferred income tax liabilities Software 190 211 Client contracts and related intangibles 835 3,127 Goodwill 7,590 6,747 Net operating loss carryforwards 23,038 23,298 Property and equipment 15,219 15,048 Convertible debt securities 16,853 27,708 Deferred revenue 3,354 961 Contingent payments 849 840 Facility abandonment 2,231 2,194 Other 1,235 290 Total non-current deferred income tax liabilities 7,930 19,162 Less: valuation allowance 1,307 1,284 Net non-current deferred income tax liabilities 9,237 20,446 We regularly assess the likelihood of the future realization of our deferred income tax assets. To the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that a deferred income tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established. As of December31, 2015, we believe that between: icarryback opportunities to past periods with taxable income; and iisufficient taxable income to be generated in the future, we will realize 100% of the benefit of our U.S. Federal deferred income tax assets, thus no valuation allowance has been established. As of December31, 2015, we have deferred income tax assets related to state and foreign income tax jurisdictions of $27 million and $297 million, respectively, and have established valuation allowances against those deferred income tax assets of $25 million and $149 million, respectively. 
As of December31, 2015 and 2014, we have an acquired U.S. Federal net operating loss NOL carryforward of approximately $50 million and $51 million, respectively, which will begin to expire in 2019 and can be utilized through 2030. The acquired U.S. Federal NOL carryforward is attributable to the pre-acquisition periods of acquired subsidiaries. The annual utilization of this U.S. Federal NOL carryforward is limited pursuant to Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, as of December31, 2015 and 2014, we have: istate NOL carryforwards of approximately $63 million and $63 million, respectively, which will expire beginning in 2016 and end in 2036; and iiforeign subsidiary NOL carryforwards of approximately $91 million and $96 million, respectively, which will expire beginning in 2017, with a portion of the losses available over an indefinite period of time. 
Our 2004 Convertible Debt Securities, which we fully extinguished in 2011, were subject to special U.S. Treasury regulations governing contingent payment debt instruments. These regulations allowed us to take a tax deduction for interest expense on our U.S. Federal income tax return at a constant rate of 909% subject to certain adjustments, compounded semi-annually, which represented the estimated yield on comparable non-contingent, non-convertible, fixed-rate debt instruments with terms and conditions otherwise similar to the 2004 Convertible Debt Securities. This interest expense tax deduction was greater than the interest expense reflected in the accompanying Income Statements, thus creating a deferred income tax liability. The extinguishment of the 2004 Convertible Debt 
62 Securities resulted in: ithe holders of the 2004 Convertible Debt Securities not having the ability to achieve the 909% target yield, and iia requirement for us to pay an amount equal to the cumulative deferred income tax liability to the U.S. tax authorities without interest or penalties. During the third and fourth quarters of 2011, we paid cash of approximately $6 million related to the deferred income tax liabilities associated with the 2004 Convertible Debt Securities repurchased in June and July of 2011. In 2015, we paid cash of $56 million related to the deferred income tax liabilities associated with the 2004 Convertible Debt Securities repurchased in 2009 and 2010. The remaining balance owed of approximately $18 million will be paid ratably over the next three years.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. We are required to estimate our income tax liability in each jurisdiction in which we operate, including U.S. Federal, state and foreign income tax jurisdictions. Various judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provisions for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are certain transactions and calculations for which the ultimate income tax determination may be uncertain. In addition, we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities, which could result in adverse outcomes. For these reasons, we establish a liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest may be due. This liability is adjusted based upon changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the expiration of a statute of limitations or the refinement of an estimate. 
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in thousands: 2015 2014 2013 Balance, beginning of year 3,417 3,713 3,372 Additions based on tax positions related to current year 150 351 173 Additions for tax positions of prior years 925 30 569 Reductions for tax positions of prior years 413 677 401 Balance, end of year 4,079 3,417 3,713 As discussed earlier, in connection with our immaterial correction of our 2014 and 2013 Financial Statements, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits was reduced by $04 million and $58 million, respectively.
We recognize interest and penalty expense associated with our liability for unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense in our Income Statements. In addition to the $41 million, $34 million, and $37 million of liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of December31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we had $03 million, $02 million, and $02 million, respectively, of income tax-related accrued interest, net of any federal benefit of deduction. If recognized, the $41 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December31, 2015, would favorably impact our effective tax rate in future periods. 
We file income tax returns in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state and local jurisdictions, and many foreign jurisdictions. The U.S., U.K., and Australia are the main taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. The years open for audit vary depending on the taxing jurisdiction. As of December31, 2014, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service had commenced an audit of our 2010 through 2012 tax years. In addition, the U.S. Federal statute of limitations has expired for periods prior to 2010, and the statute of limitations has expired in our major state jurisdictions of Nebraska, Colorado and Florida for years prior to 2002, 2011, and 2012, respectively. In 2012, we completed our audit in the U.K. for the accounting periods beginning October1, 2005 and ended September30, 2010. We have been audited in Australia for years prior to 2007. In addition, the statute of limitations has expired in Australia for years prior to 2011.We estimate that it is reasonably possible that the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by up to $24 million over the next twelve months due to completion of audits and the expiration of statute of limitations. 8.
Employee Retirement Benefit Plans 
Defined Contribution-Type Plans. We sponsor defined contribution plans covering substantially all our U.S.-based employees. Participants may contribute up to 100% of their annual wages, subject to certain limitations, as pretax, salary deferral contributions. We make certain matching, and at our discretion, service-based contributions to the plan. The expense related to matching and service-related contributions for 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $97 million, $90 million, and $97 million, respectively. We also have defined contribution-type plans for certain of our non-U.S.-based employees. The total contributions made to these plans in 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $37 million, $50 million, and $48 million, respectively. 63 9.
Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies 
Operating Leases. We lease certain office and production facilities under noncancellable operating leases, with the longest lease that runs through July 2025. The leases generally are renewable and provide for the payment of real estate taxes and certain other occupancy expenses. Future aggregate minimum lease payments under these facilities are as follows: 2016 - $131 million; 2017 - $124 million; 2018 - $120 million; 2019 - $101 million; 2020 - $73 million; and thereafter - $286 million. Total rent expense for 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $171 million, $199 million, and $200 million, respectively. 
Service Agreements. We have an agreement with Infocrossing LLC Infocrossing, a Wipro Limited company, to provide us outsourced data center services. We amended our previous agreement with Infocrossing in 2015, which extended the term of the agreement through June30, 2022. We outsource the data processing and related computer services required for the operation of our outsourced ACP processing services. Our ACP proprietary software and other software applications are run in an outsourced data center environment in order to obtain the necessary computer processing capacity and other computer support services without us having to make the substantial capital and infrastructure investments that would be necessary for us to provide these services internally. Our clients are connected to the outsourced data center environment through a combination of private and commercially-provided networks. Our ACP processing services are generally considered to be mission critical customer management systems by our clients. As a result, we are highly dependent upon Infocrossing for system availability, security, and response time. 
Warranties. We generally warrant that our solutions and related offerings will conform to published specifications, or to specifications provided in an individual client arrangement, as applicable. The typical warranty period is 90 days from delivery of the solution or offering. For certain service offerings we provide a limited warranty for the duration of the services provided. We generally warrant that services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner. The typical remedy for breach of warranty is to correct or replace any defective deliverable, and if not possible or practical, we will accept the return of the defective deliverable and refund the amount paid under the client arrangement that is allocable to the defective deliverable. Our contracts also generally contain limitation of damages provisions in an effort to reduce our exposure to monetary damages arising from breach of warranty claims. Historically, we have incurred minimal warranty costs, and as a result, do not maintain a warranty reserve. 
Product and Services Indemnifications. Our arrangements with our clients generally include an indemnification provision that will indemnify and defend a client in actions brought against the client that claim our products and/or services infringe upon a copyright, trade secret, or valid patent. Historically, we have not incurred any significant costs related to such indemnification claims, and as a result, do not maintain a reserve for such exposure. 
Claims for Company Non-performance. Our arrangements with our clients typically cap our liability for breach to a specified amount of the direct damages incurred by the client resulting from the breach. From time-to-time, these arrangements may also include provisions for possible liquidated damages or other financial remedies for our non-performance, or in the case of certain of our outsourced customer care and billing solutions, provisions for damages related to service level performance requirements. The service level performance requirements typically relate to system availability and timeliness of service delivery. As of December31, 2015, we believe we have adequate reserves, based on our historical experience, to cover any reasonably anticipated exposure as a result of our nonperformance for any past or current arrangements with our clients. 
Indemnifications Related to Officers and the Board of Directors. We have agreed to indemnify members of our Board of Directors the Board and certain of our officers if they are named or threatened to be named as a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that they acted in such capacity. We maintain directors and officers DO insurance coverage to protect against such losses. We have not historically incurred any losses related to these types of indemnifications, and are not aware of any pending or threatened actions or claims against any officer or member of our Board. As a result, we have not recorded any liabilities related to such indemnifications as of December31, 2015. In addition, as a result of the insurance policy coverage, we believe these indemnification agreements are not significant to our results of operations. 
Favorable Settlement of Claims.In 2014, we executed a settlement agreement ending litigation we asserted against a third party for patent infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets.In exchange for the release from the lawsuit initiated, we will receive a total of $6 million, with a portion paid in 2014, and the remainder in annual installments through 2017.We recorded a total of $39 million net of a time value discount and legal costs incurred as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses in 2014.
Legal Proceedings. From time-to-time, we are involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. 64 10.Stockholders Equity 
Stock Repurchase Program. We currently have a stock repurchase program, approved by our Board, authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock from time-to-time as market and business conditions warrant the Stock Repurchase Program. In February 2015, our Board approved a 75 million share increase in the number of shares authorized for repurchase under the Stock Repurchase Program, bringing the total number of shares authorized to 425 million.During 2015, 2014, and 2013, we repurchased 03 million shares of our common stock for $69 million weightedaverage price of $2706 per share, 07 million shares of our common stock for $191 million weighted-average price of $2605 per share, and 05 million shares of our common stock for $101 million weighted-average price of $2023 per share, respectively, under a Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Rule 10b5-1 Plan.
In March 2015, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase transaction agreement the ASR Agreement with a counterparty to repurchase $50 million of our common stock.We paid $50 million to the counterparty and received an initial delivery of 13 million shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate value of approximately $40 million.The $10 million forward equity contract was settled in December 2015.Total shares purchased under the ASR Agreement in 2015 were 16 million shares at an average purchase price of $3164 per share.The shares were reflected as treasury stock in the periods the shares were delivered.The ASR Agreement met all the applicable criteria for equity classification, and, therefore, was not accounted for as a derivative instrument.
As of December 31, 2015, the total remaining number of shares available for repurchase under the Stock Repurchase Program totaled approximately 71 million shares.
In addition to the above mentioned stock repurchases, during 2015, 2014, and 2013, we repurchased and then cancelled approximately 265,000 shares, 252,000 shares, and 264,000 shares for $81 million, $69 million, and $54 million, respectively, of common stock from our employees in connection with minimum tax withholding requirements resulting from the vesting of restricted stock under our stock incentive plans. 
Cash Dividend.In 2013, our Board approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend to be paid to our stockholders.During 2015 and 2014, the Board approved total cash dividends of $070 per share and $06225 per share of common stock, totaling $229 million and $213 million, respectively. 
Warrants.In 2014, we entered into an amendment to our current agreement with Comcast the Amended Agreement.The Amended Agreement provides the framework for Comcast to consolidate its residential customer accounts onto our ACP customer care and billing solution.As an additional incentive for Comcast to migrate new customer accounts to ACP, the Amended Agreement includes the issuance of stock warrants the Warrant Agreement for the right to purchase up to approximately 29 million shares of our common stock the Stock Warrants, 19 million warrants relate to Comcasts existing residential business and the remaining 10 million warrants relate to additional residential customer accounts that Comcast may acquire and migrate onto ACP in the future.The Stock Warrants have a 10-year term and an exercise price of $2668 per warrant.
The 19 million of the Stock Warrants relate to Comcasts existing residential business and vested as follows The first 25% of these Stock Warrants approximately 05 million vested upon the successful migration of the first 05 million customer accounts, which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2014 upon the successful migration of two million new Comcast customer accounts. The next 25% of these Stock Warrants had a time-based vesting provision, and vested in January 2015. The next 25% of these Stock Warrants vest only after a cumulative total of 55 million customer accounts are migrated onto ACP. The last 25% of these Stock Warrants vest proportionately based on the number of customer accounts migrated above 55 million accounts, with full vesting based on a target of 57 million customer accounts above the 55 million account level i.e., a total target of 112 million customer account migrations.
The remaining 10 million Stock Warrants that relate to additional residential accounts that Comcast may acquire and migrate onto ACP in the future only vest proportionately with acquired customer accounts migrated onto ACP from other providers billing platforms, with full vesting based on a target of 5 million newly migrated customer accounts. 
Fifty percent of the unvested Stock Warrants become fully vested upon a fundamental change including a change in control of the Company, as defined, proportionally reducing the number of Stock Warrants eligible for vesting based on future performance conditions.
65 Once vested, Comcast may exercise the Stock Warrants and elect either physical delivery of common shares or net share settlement cashless exercise.Alternatively, the exercise of the Stock Warrants may be settled with cash based solely on our approval, or if Comcast were to beneficially own or control in excess of 1999% of the common stock or voting of the Company.
The fair value of the 05 million Stock Warrants that vested in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $36 million, as determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.Upon vesting, this amount was recorded as a client incentive asset with the corresponding offset to stockholders equity.
The fair value of the 05 million Stock Warrants that vested in January 2015 was $37 million at the grant date, as determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.This amount is being recorded ratably over the vesting period as a client incentive asset with the corresponding offset to stockholders equity.
The client incentive asset related to the Stock Warrants is being amortized as a reduction in processing and related services revenues over the remaining term of the Comcast amended agreement.As of December 31, 2015, we recorded a client incentive asset related to these Stock Warrants of $73 million and have amortized $20 million as a reduction in processing and related services revenues.
The remaining unvested Stock Warrants will be accounted for as client incentive assets in the period the performance conditions necessary for vesting have been met.As of December 31, 2015, none of the Stock Warrants had been exercised.
Convertible Debt Securities. Under GAAP, convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement must be separated into their liability and equity components at initial recognition by: irecording the liability component at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component; and iiattributing the remaining proceeds from the issuance to the equity component. The carrying amount of the equity component related to our convertible debt securities outstanding, included within additional paid-in capital, net of tax, as of December31, 2015 and 2014 was $229 million. 11.
Equity Compensation Plans 
Stock Incentive Plans 
Stock Incentive Plan. In 2014, our stockholders approved an increase of 29 million shares authorized for issuance under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan the 2005 Plan, from 158 million shares to 187 million shares.Shares reserved under the 2005 Plan can be granted to officers and other key employees of our company and its subsidiaries and to non-employee directors of our company in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance unit awards, restricted stock awards, or stock bonus awards.Shares granted under the 2005 Plan in the form of a performance unit award, restricted stock award or stock bonus award are counted toward the aggregate number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2005 Plan as two shares for every one share granted or issued in payment of such award.As of December 31, 2015, 42 million shares were available for issuance, with 36 million shares available for grant. 
Restricted Stock. We generally issue new shares versus treasury shares to fulfill restricted stock award grants. Restricted stock awards are granted at no cost to the recipient. Historically, our restricted stock awards have vested annually primarily over three or four years with no restrictions other than the passage of time i.e., the shares are released upon calendar vesting with no further restrictions Time-Based Awards. Unvested Time-Based Awards are typically forfeited and cancelled upon termination of employment with our company. Certain Time-Based Awards become fully vested vesting accelerates upon a change in control, as defined, and the subsequent involuntary termination of employment. The fair value of the Time-Based Awards determined by using the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date is charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. 
We also issue restricted stock shares to key members of management that vest in equal installments over three years upon meeting either pre-established financial performance objectives or pre-established stock price objectives Performance-Based Awards. The structure of the performance goals for the Performance-Based Awards has been approved by our stockholders. The Performance-Based Awards become fully vested vesting accelerates upon a change in control, as defined, and the subsequent involuntary termination of employment. The fair value of the Performance-Based Awards determined by using the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date is charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, taking into consideration the probability of vesting, for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award is, in-substance, multiple awards. 66 A summary of our unvested restricted stock activity during 2015 is as follows shares in thousands: 2015 Shares  Unvested awards, January1, 2015 2,311 2281 Awards granted 736 3071 Awards forfeited/cancelled 109 2395 Awards vested 814 2188 Unvested awards, December31, 2015 2,124 2603 The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of restricted stock shares granted during 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $3071, $2645, and $1975, respectively. The total market value of restricted stock shares vesting during 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $248 million, $207 million, and $162 million, respectively. 
1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
As of December31, 2015, we have an employee stock purchase plan whereby 17million shares of our common stock have been reserved for sale to our U.S. employees through payroll deductions. The price for shares purchased under the plan is 85% of market value on the last day of the purchase period. Purchases are made at the end of each month. During 2015, 2014, and 2013, 58,927 shares, 61,592 shares, and 68,845 shares, respectively, were purchased under the plan for $16 million $2084 to $3058 per share, $14 million $2131 to $2547 per share, and $14 million $1601 to $2499 per share, respectively.

As of December31, 2015 there was $355 million of total compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet recognized. That cost, excluding the impact of forfeitures, is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 22 years.

Fluctuations in our effective income tax rate between quarters generally relates to the accounting for discrete income tax items in any given quarter, and revisions of estimates for certain income tax components during the year. For 2015:Our effective income tax rates for the first, second, third, and fourth quarters were 44%, 43%, 40%, and 19%, respectively.The low fourth quarter rate can be mainly attributed to full year impact of the 2015 RD tax credits, as the legislation was not passed until December 2015. For 2014:Our effective income tax rates for the first, second, third, and fourth quarters were 43%, 47%, 48%, and 32%, respectively.The low fourth quarter rate can be mainly attributed to full year impact of the 2014 RD tax credits, as the legislation was not passed until December 2014. 3
During the first, third, and fourth quarters of 2014 we incurred restructuring expenses of $12 million, $78 million, and $49 million, respectively, or $002, $012, and $010 per diluted share see Note 6. 4
