To the Stockholders of Brio Technology, Inc.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Brio
Technology, Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2001
and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders'
equity deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
March 31, 2001. These financial statements and the schedule referred to below
are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Brio Technology, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of March 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31,
2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.
Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed under 14 a is
presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commissions rules and is not part of the basic financial statements. This
schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all
material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

Brio is subject to a number of risks associated with companies in a similar
stage of development, including rapid technological change, dependence on key
personnel and the sales force, potential competition from larger, more
established companies, dependence on product development and the ability to
penetrate the market with its products.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Brio and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of Brio subsidiaries is the local currency.
Accordingly, Brio applies the current rate method to translate the
subsidiaries' financial statements into U.S. dollars. Translation adjustments
are included in accumulated components of comprehensive income loss in
stockholders' equity deficit in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. Transaction gains and losses of approximately $870,000 in fiscal
2001, approximately $429,000 in fiscal 2000 and approximately $126,000 in
fiscal 1999, are included in interest and other income expense, net, in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Brio considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. At March 31, 2001 and 2000, Brio
held its cash in checking and money market accounts.
Short-Term Investments
Management determines the appropriate classifications of investments in debt
and equity securities at the time of purchase. All of Brio investments are
classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are
41               BRIO TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported in
accumulated components of comprehensive income loss in stockholders' equity
deficit in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The fair
value of Brio available-for-sale securities is based on quoted market prices
at the balance sheet dates. Realized gains and losses and declines in value
judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are
included in interest and other income expense, net, in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations. The cost of securities sold is based on
the specific identification method. Interest on securities classified as
available-for-sale is included in interest and other income expense, net, in
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
A summary of the fair value of Brio available-for-sale investment
portfolio is as follows in thousands                                  March 31,

9,036 25,431
Less: Cash  6,756 13,600
Total short-term  $2,280 $11,831
Significant Concentrations
Financial instruments that potentially subject Brio to concentrations of
credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. Brio performs periodic
credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and generally does
not require collateral. As of March 31, 2001, one customer accounted for more
than 10% of total accounts receivable. As of March 31, 2000, no customer
accounted for more than 10% of total accounts receivable. For the years ended
March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, no customer accounted for more than 10% of
total revenues.
Inventories
Brio inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market on a first-
in, first-out basis. Inventory consists principally of completed software
packages including media and documentation.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives three to seven years of
the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term
of the related lease or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Property and equipment consists of the following in thousands                                 March 31,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Long-lived Assets
Brio periodically reviews long-lived assets, certain identifiable
intangibles and goodwill related to these assets for impairment in accordance
with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and For
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of.
For assets to be held and used, including acquired intangibles, Brio
initiates its review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to
the expected future undiscounted cash flows without interest charges that the
asset is expected to generate. Any impairment to be recognized is measured by
the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market
value.
Assets to be disposed of and for which management has committed to a plan to
dispose of the assets, whether through sale or abandonment, are reported at the
lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
Revenue Recognition
Effective April 1, 1998, Brio adopted Statement of Position SOP 97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition. SOP 97-2 provides guidance on applying
generally accepted accounting principles in recognizing revenue on software
transactions. The adoption of SOP 97-2 did not have a material impact on Brio
consolidated financial position or the timing of Brio revenue recognition, or
cause changes to its revenue recognition policy.
The Company revenues are derived from two sources, license fees and
services. Services include software maintenance and support, training and
system implementation consulting.
Revenue from license fees is recognized upon shipment of the software if
collection of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or
determinable and vendor-specific objective evidence exists to allocate the
total fee to all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement. If
vendor-specific objective evidence does not exist to allocate the total fee to
all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue is deferred
until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements, or until all
elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. Such undelivered elements in
these arrangements typically consist of services.
Allowances are established for potential product returns and credit losses.
In instances where payments are subject to extended payment terms, revenue is
deferred until the earlier of the date when payments become due or the date
payment is received. If an acceptance period is required, revenue is recognized
upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance
period.
Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance
contract. If maintenance is included in an arrangement which includes a license
agreement, amounts related to maintenance are unbundled from the license fee
based on vendor specific objective evidence. Consulting and training revenue is
recognized when the services are performed.
Cost of revenues consists primarily of third-party fees, related personnel
and overhead allocations, the cost of media, documentation, packaging and
shipping related to products sold.
Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue represents amounts received from customers under certain
license, maintenance and service agreements for which the revenue earnings
process has not been completed. In situations where the
43               BRIO TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
services are not expected to be provided and revenue recognized within twelve
months of the balance sheet date, such amounts are classified as noncurrent
deferred revenue.
Software Development Costs
Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 86 Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed,
costs incurred in the research and development of software products are
expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established. Once
established, these costs are capitalized. Amounts that could have been
capitalized under this Statement were insignificant and, therefore, no costs
have been capitalized to date.
Comprehensive Income
In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No.
130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which was adopted by Brio in the quarter
ended June 30, 1998. SFAS No. 130 requires companies to report a new,
additional measure of income on the statement of operations or to create a new
financial statement that has the new measure of income on it. Comprehensive
income loss includes foreign currency translation gains and losses and other
unrealized gains and losses that have been previously excluded from net income
loss and reflected in equity instead. Brio has reported the components of
comprehensive income loss on its consolidated statements of stockholders'
equity deficit.
Computation of Basic Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding. No diluted net loss per share information
is presented as Brio has incurred net losses in all periods presented.
Potential common shares from conversion of preferred stock, stock options and
warrants and contingently issuable shares have been excluded from the
calculation of diluted net loss per share as they are antidilutive. Potential
common shares of 2,399,000 and 5,023,873 using the treasury stock method were
not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share for the years
ended March 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, because Brio incurred a loss in
these periods and, therefore, their effect would be antidilutive.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The
statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every
derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or
liability measured at its fair value. SFAS No. 133 is effective for Brio
fiscal year beginning April 1, 2001. Management believes the adoption of SFAS
No. 133 will not have a material effect on Brio financial statements.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year financial statement balances have been reclassified to
conform to the fiscal 2001 presentation.
3. ACQUISITIONS SQRIBE
On February 23, 1999, Brio entered into a definitive merger agreement with
SQRIBE Technologies Corp. SQRIBE. Under the terms of the agreement, upon
closing of the transaction, Brio stockholders would hold approximately 55% of
Brio, with former SQRIBE stockholders holding approximately 45%.
44               BRIO TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  In August 1999, Brio completed its merger with SQRIBE. Brio acquired all of
the outstanding shares of SQRIBE preferred and common stock in a tax-free,
stock-for-stock transaction for approximately 132 million shares of Brio
common stock. In addition, Brio assumed all outstanding stock options and
warrants of SQRIBE. The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling-of-
interests. All prior period consolidated financial statements were restated, in
accordance with required pooling-of-interests accounting and disclosures.
SQRIBE had a fiscal year that ended on December 31 of each year. The
consolidated financial statements combine the SQRIBE results for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 1998, with Brio results for the year ended March 31,
1999. In order to conform SQRIBE fiscal year to Brio fiscal year, the
results of operations of SQRIBE for the three months ended March 31, 1999 have
been reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings as of that date. Revenue,
net loss and net loss applicable to common stock for SQRIBE was $108 million 18 million and $36 million, respectively, for the three months ended March
31, 1999. Reconciliation of the consolidated financial statements with
previously reported separate company performance for the year ended March 31,
1999 is presented below in thousands                                    Year Ended

MerlinSoft
In October 1998, Brio acquired all of the outstanding stock of MerlinSoft,
Inc. MerlinSoft, a California corporation, for cash. The total purchase price
was $22 million, and the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. In
connection with the acquisition, net intangibles of $23 million were acquired.
The results of operations of MerlinSoft and the estimated fair value of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in Brio financial
statements from the date of acquisition. Intangibles arising from the
acquisition are being amortized on a straight-line basis over three years.
While Brio relied upon a third party appraisal of the acquired intangible
assets, management was primarily responsible for estimating their fair values.
Management estimates that $17 million of the purchased intangibles represented
purchased in-process research and development that had not yet reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The excess of the
purchase price over identified assets was approximately $600,000.
The purchased in-process research and development consisted of two projects.
Both of these projects are aimed at the delivery of timely, in-depth,
sophisticated analytical applications. The first product provides data models
for analyses in specific industries and functional areas, metric libraries, a
web-based client, and the ability for business users to manage application
components Analysis Product. The second product
45               BRIO TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
includes in-depth modeling features for margin analysis and what-if scenarios
to determine the impact of various decisions and parameters Modeling
Product. The research and development costs incurred by MerlinSoft in the
development of the Analysis Product were approximately $298,000 in fiscal 1998
and approximately $4,000 in fiscal 1997. The research and development costs
incurred by MerlinSoft in the development of the Modeling Product were
approximately $34,000 in fiscal 1998. At the date of acquisition, the research
and development costs to complete the Analysis Product were estimated by
MerlinSoft to be approximately $855,000 in fiscal 2000 and 1999. At the date of
acquisition, the research and development costs to complete the Modeling
Product project were estimated by MerlinSoft to be approximately $933,000 in
fiscal 2000 and 1999.
As of March 31, 2001, Brio has successfully completed the Analysis and
Modeling Products. MerlinSoft results have not differed significantly from
the forecast assumptions. The risks associated with the products are still
considered high and no assurance can be made that the products will meet market
expectations. If these projects do not meet market expectations, the operating
results and financial condition of Brio may be adversely affected.
Additionally, the value of other intangible assets acquired may become
impaired. Comparative pro forma information has not been presented as the
operations of MerlinSoft were not material to Brio consolidated financial
statements.
4. INDUSTRY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION  Brio adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information, in fiscal 1998. SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for
reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements
and requires selected information about operating segments in interim financial
reports issued to stockholders. It also establishes standards for related
disclosures about products and services, and geographic areas. Operating
segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate
financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief
operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate
resources and in assessing performance.
Brio is organized based upon the nature of the products and services it
offers. Under this organizational structure, Brio operates in two business
segments: license fees and services. Brio evaluates its segment performance
based on several factors including revenue and gross profit. Brio does not
allocate or report financial operations by segment beyond revenue and cost of
revenue, nor do we allocate long-term assets by business segment. No additional
segment information is reported in this footnote as required segment
disclosures are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Brio markets its products in the United States and Canada and in other
foreign countries through its domestic sales personnel and its foreign
subsidiaries. Revenues by geographic area were as follows                                  2001 2000 1999
United States and  80% 82% 82%

2001, 2000, and 1999. None of Brio international operations have material
items of long-lived assets.
5. COMMITMENTS  Brio leases various facilities under operating leases which expire on
various dates through May 2010. Brio also leases office equipment under various
non-cancelable operating leases with terms which expire through

December 2004. For leases with escalating rent payments, rent expense is
amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. Future minimum
lease payments relating to these agreements are as follows  Years Ended March 31,

$7,950,000, $4,620,000 and $3,533,000, respectively.
6. LINE OF CREDIT  As of March 31, 2001, Brio maintains a bank line of credit. The line
provides for up to $150 million in borrowings, with interest at the bank
prime rate 80% at March 31, 2001. Borrowings under the accounts receivable
line of credit are limited to 80% of eligible accounts receivable. The line of
credit is collateralized by substantially all of Brio assets, including
Brio intellectual property, accounts receivable and property and equipment to
the extent required to secure the line. As of March 31, 2001, the line of
credit requires Brio to comply with various covenants, including quarterly
requirements to maintain a minimum quick ratio as well as achieve minimum
profitability or not exceed a maximum quarterly loss. Brio was not in
compliance with the profitability covenant as of March 31, 2001, however, a
waiver was obtained from the bank. The line of credit expires on March 31,
2002. No amounts are outstanding under the line as of March 31, 2001.
As part of the merger with SQRIBE, Brio assumed a $25 million bank line of
credit. During fiscal 2000, all amounts outstanding under the line were paid
and the line was cancelled. Brio also assumed a $10 million equipment purchase
line of credit under which a $500,000 letter of credit was outstanding to
support a facilities lease. In December 2000, the letter of credit was
cancelled. A new letter of credit in the amount of $300,000 was issued under
the new Brio bank line of credit in May 2001.
7. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Common Stock
In February 1998, the Board of Directors authorized the filing of a
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register
shares of its common stock in connection with a proposed Initial Public
Offering IPO. On May 1, 1998, the offering was consummated and all of the
then currently outstanding convertible preferred stock converted to 5,466,172
shares of common stock upon the closing of the IPO.
In April 1998, Brio board of directors approved a one-for-two reverse
stock split of its preferred and common stock. All preferred stock, common
stock and per share amounts have been adjusted retroactively to give effect to
the reverse stock split.
In April 1998, Brio board of directors approved the reincorporation of
Brio in Delaware in connection with Brio IPO which was consummated May 1,
1998. Upon reincorporation, Brio issued new shares with a par value of $0001
per share to all preferred and common stockholders.
47               BRIO TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Upon closing of the merger with SQRIBE in August 1999, all of the then
outstanding shares of SQRIBE convertible preferred stock were converted to
4,610,597 shares of Brio common stock.
Upon closing of the merger with SQRIBE in August 1999, all of the then
outstanding shares of redeemable common stock of SQRIBE were converted to
153,612 shares of Brio common stock.
As of March 31, 2001, Brio has reserved the following shares of its common
stock for future issuance                                  
Employee stock purchase  1,058,777
Exercise of stock  16,851,305
Other option and warrant    2,560
Total shares  17,912,642
During fiscal 1997, certain employees funded the purchase of common stock
under the 1992 Stock Option Plan with fully secured notes payable to Brio.
As part of the merger with SQRIBE, Brio assumed an agreement, dated in
fiscal 1998, that permitted certain employees to accelerate the exercisability
of their options to purchase 1,232,589 shares of common stock covered by their
option agreements in exchange for full recourse promissory notes totaling
$1,641,000. The notes bear interest at 7% and are due in 2003. Repayment of
the notes accelerates in the event of termination of employment. The shares
purchased under the agreement have been pledged as partial security for the
notes. Brio has the right to repurchase these shares at the original sale
price based on the vesting schedule in the original option agreements. During
fiscal 2001, 12,611 shares of stock were repurchased and the related notes
from the terminated employees were cancelled as permitted under the
arrangement. No shares were repurchased under this agreement in fiscal 2000.
At March 31, 2001, all notes subject to this repurchase right have been paid
in full or have been cancelled due to termination as permitted under the
arrangement.
Stock Options
Through March 31, 2001, Brio has 2,079,795 shares of common stock reserved
for issuance under the 1992 Stock Option Plan the Plan. Under the Plan,
the Board of Directors may grant options to purchase Brio common stock to
employees, directors, or consultants at an exercise price of not less than
100% of the fair value of Brio common stock. Any options granted must be
granted by the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Plan. Options
issued under the Plan generally have a term of five years from the date of
grant and generally one-fourth of the shares vest one year from the vesting
commencement date with the remaining shares vesting in 36 equal monthly
installments.
Brio 1998 Stock Option Plan the 1998 Plan was adopted by Brio Board
of Directors in February 1998. Through March 31, 2001, Brio has 9,862,087
shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 1998 Plan. The shares
reserved for issuance under the 1998 Plan increase annually on the first day
of Brio fiscal year through April 1, 2003, by the lesser of 1,000,000 or
four percent of the shares outstanding on the last day of the immediately
preceding fiscal year. Under the 1998 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant
options to purchase Brio common stock to employees, directors or consultants
at an exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair value of Brio common
stock on the date of grant, in the case of incentive stock options, and not
less than 85% of the fair value of Brio common stock on the date of grant,
in the case of nonqualified stock options. Options must all be granted by the
tenth anniversary of the effective date of the 1998 Plan. Options issued under
the 1998 Plan will generally have a term of 10 years from the date of grant
and will generally one-fourth of the shares vest one year from the vesting
commencement date with the remaining shares vesting in 36 equal monthly
installments.
Brio 1998 Directors' Stock Option Plan the Directors' Plan was
adopted by Brio Board of Directors in February 1998. A total of 300,000
shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under
48               BRIO TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
the Directors' Plan. Through March 31, 2001, 125,000 options have been granted
under the Directors' Plan. The Directors' Plan provides for the initial grant
of nonqualified stock options to purchase 20,000 shares of common stock on the
date on which the optionee first becomes a non-employee director of Brio
subsequent to the initial public offering the First Option, and an
additional option to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock on the next
anniversary to existing and future non-employee directors of Brio if, on such
date, the director has served on the board for at least six months the
Subsequent Option. The exercise price per share of all options granted under
the Directors' Plan will equal the fair market value of a share of Brio
common stock on the date of grant of the option. Options issued under the
Directors' Plan will have a term of 10 years from the date of grant; the First
Option shall become exercisable in installments of 25% of the total number of
shares subject to the First Option on each of the first, second, third and
fourth anniversaries of the date of grant of the First Option; each Subsequent
Option shall become exercisable in full on the day before the first anniversary
of the date of grant of that Subsequent Option.
Brio 2000 Stock Option Plan the 2000 Plan was adopted by Brio Board
of Directors in July 2000. Through March 31, 2001, Brio has 6,000,000 shares of
common stock reserved for issuance under the 2000 Plan. Under the 2000 Plan,
the Board of Directors may grant only non-qualified stock options to purchase
Brio common stock to non-executive employees, directors or consultants at an
exercise price of not less than not less than 85% of the fair value of Brio
common stock on the date of grant. Options must all be granted by the tenth
anniversary of the effective date of the 2000 Plan. Options issued under the
2000 Plan will generally have a term of 10 years from the date of grant and
generally one-fourth of the shares vest one year from the vesting commencement
date with the remaining shares vesting in 36 equal monthly installments.
As part of the merger with SQRIBE, Brio assumed all options outstanding
under SQRIBE 1995 Stock Option Plan as amended and restated. No additional
options will be granted under this plan. Stock options granted under this plan
generally have vesting terms of four years and are exercisable for a period not
to exceed ten years from the date of issuance.

Brio 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan was adopted
by Brio Board of Directors in February 1998. Through March 31, 2001, Brio has
2,092,009 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the Purchase Plan.
The shares reserved for issuance under the Purchase Plan increase annually on
the first day of Brio fiscal year through April 1, 2000, by the lesser of
300,000 or two percent of the shares outstanding on the last day of the
immediately preceding fiscal year. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees
to purchase common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of Brio
common stock on the first day or the last day of each six-month offering
period.
Brio accounts for its stock option and employee stock purchase plans the
Plans under APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Had compensation expense for these Plans been determined consistent with SFAS

As part of the merger with SQRIBE, Brio assumed a warrant agreement that
granted rights to purchase 2,560 shares of common stock at $410 per share.
These rights were issued in connection with a financing transaction in 1995. As
of March 31, 2001, the warrant, which expires in fiscal 2002, is still
outstanding.
As part of the merger with SQRIBE, Brio assumed a severance agreement with
an officer, dated in 1996, whereby the officer was granted the right to
purchase 8,534 shares of common stock at $234 per share if the fair market
value of the common stock did not exceed certain specified targets by December
31, 1999. In 1996, $110,000 was accrued as severance expense for the estimated
fair value of the arrangement. As of December 31, 1999, the specified targets
discussed above were met and, accordingly, the right to purchase the shares
expired.
As part of the merger with SQRIBE, Brio assumed a warrant agreement, dated
in fiscal 1998, that granted rights to a consulting firm to purchase 25,602
shares of common stock at $703 per share. An expense of $106,000 was recorded
for the fair value of these warrants when they were issued. The warrants to
purchase 25,602 shares of common stock were exercised in fiscal 2001.
Deferred Compensation
In connection with the granting of 1,369,368 stock options to employees
during the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998, with a weighted average exercise
price of $149 per share and a weighted average deemed fair market value of
$191 per share, Brio recorded deferred compensation of $580,000, representing
the difference between the deemed value of the common stock for accounting
purposes and the option exercise price of such options at the date of grant. In
addition, Brio granted 67,419 stock options to employees during fiscal 1999, at
a weighted average exercise price of $156 per share, with a weighted average
deemed fair market value of $427 per share and recorded the difference between
the deemed fair market value of the common stock for accounting purposes and
the option exercise price of such options at the date of grant as $63,000 of
compensation expense and $188,000 of deferred compensation. Such amount is
presented as a reduction of stockholder equity deficit and amortized
ratably over the vesting period of the applicable options. Approximately
$55,000, $155,000, and $129,000 was expensed during the fiscal years ended
March 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively, and the balance will be expensed
ratably over the next year as the options vest.
8. CONTINGENCIES  On January 20, 1997, Business Objects filed a complaint against Brio in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Jose,
alleging that certain of Brio products including at least the
51               BRIO TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
BrioQuery Navigator, BrioQuery Explorer and BrioQuery Designer products
infringed at least claims 1, 2, and 4 of U.S. Patent Number 5,555,403. On April
4, 1997, Brio filed an answer and affirmative defenses to the complaint,
denying certain of the allegations in the complaint and asserting a
counterclaim requesting declaratory relief that Brio is not infringing the
patent and that the patent is invalid and unenforceable. In December 1997,
venue for the case was changed to the Northern District of California in San
Francisco. On July 30, 1999, Brio filed an action against Business Objects in
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Jose,
alleging that certain of Business Objects' products infringe U.S. Patent Number
5,915,257. On September 9, 1999, Brio and Business Objects executed a
Memorandum of Understanding settling Business Objects' pending patent
litigation against Brio involving patent number 5,555,403 for $100 million,
payable in $10 million payments over 10 consecutive quarters, with the first
payment due September 30, 1999. Of the $100 million settlement, $91 million
represents the net present value of the 10 quarterly payments and is included
in non-recurring operating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2000. The
remaining $900,000 represents interest that will be recognized over the payment
term using the effective interest rate method. As part of this settlement,
Business Objects dismissed its pending lawsuit against Brio involving patent
number 5,555,403 and Brio dismissed its pending lawsuit against Business
Objects involving patent number 5,915,257. As of of March 31, 2001,
approximately $29 million is included in the accompanying balance sheet in
accrued liabilities of which $30 million represents the gross value of the
remaining quarterly payments, offset by $119,000 which represents the interest
that will be recognized over the remaining quarterly payments. As of March 31,
2000, $40 million in the accompanying balance sheet is included in accrued
liabilities and $30 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities,
representing the gross value of the remaining quarterly payments, offset by
$423,900 included in accrued liabilities and $119,000 included in other
noncurrent liabilities, representing the interest that will be recognized over
the remaining quarterly payments.
