Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  31                     25           REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Comfort Systems USA, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Comfort
Systems USA, Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2000 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2001. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Comfort Systems USA, Inc., and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 2001,
and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2001
1. BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION   Comfort Systems USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation Comfort Systems and
collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company, is a national provider of
comprehensive heating, ventilation and air conditioning HVAC installation,
maintenance, repair and replacement services within the mechanical services
industry. The Company operates primarily in the commercial and industrial HVAC
markets, and performs most of its services within office buildings, retail
centers, apartment complexes, manufacturing plants, and healthcare, education
and government facilities. In addition to standard HVAC services, the Company
provides specialized applications such as building automation control systems,
fire protection, process cooling, electronic monitoring and process piping.
Certain locations also perform related services such as electrical and plumbing.
Approximately 54% of the Company consolidated 2001 revenues were attributable
to installation services, with the remaining 46% attributable to maintenance,
repair and replacement services. The Company consolidated 2001 revenues
related to the following service activities: HVAC -- 62%, plumbing -- 15 electrical -- 5%, building automation control systems -- 5%, fire
protection -- 5% and other -- 8%. These service activities are within the
mechanical services industry which is the single industry segment served by
Comfort Systems.
On March 1, 2002, the Company sold 19 operations to EMCOR Group, Inc.
EMCOR. See Note 16 for further discussion.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Comfort Systems and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
CASH FLOW INFORMATION
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Cash paid for interest in 1999, 2000 and 2001 was approximately $178
million, $258 million and $207 million, respectively. Cash paid for income
taxes in 1999, 2000 and 2001 was approximately $336 million, $131 million and
$101 million, respectively.
INVENTORIES
Inventories consist of parts and supplies held for use in the ordinary
course of business and are stated at the lower of cost or market using the
first-in, first-out method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the
expected life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when
incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which extend the
useful lives of existing equipment, are capitalized and depreciated over the
remaining useful life of the equipment. Upon retirement or disposition of
property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are
removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the
statement of operations.

COMFORT SYSTEMS USA, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
GOODWILL
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid by the
Company in acquisitions accounted for as purchases over the fair value of the
net tangible assets acquired. Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis
over 40 years. In addition, see discussion of new accounting standards related
to goodwill below in this note under Accounting Pronouncements.
As of December 31, 2000 and 2001, accumulated amortization of goodwill was
approximately $329 million and $447 million, respectively.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Long-lived assets are comprised principally of goodwill and property and
equipment. The Company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances
have occurred that indicate that the remaining balances of these assets may not
be recoverable. The Company uses an estimate of future income from operations
and cash flows, as well as other economic and business factors as a measure of
recoverability of these assets.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company enters into construction contracts with general contractors or
end-use customers based upon negotiated contracts and competitive bids. As part
of the negotiation and bidding processes, the Company estimates its contract
costs, which include all direct materials net of estimated rebates, labor and
subcontract costs and indirect costs related to contract performance such as
indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. Revenues from
construction contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method in
accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement
of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain
Production-Type Contracts. Under this method, the amount of total contract
revenue recognizable at any given time during a contract is determined by
multiplying total contract revenue by the percentage of contract costs incurred
at any given time to total estimated contract costs. Accordingly, contract
revenues recognized in the statement of operations can and usually do differ
from amounts that can be billed or invoiced to the customer at any given point
during the contract.
Changes in job performance, job conditions, estimated profitability and
final contract settlements may result in revisions to estimated costs and,
therefore, revenues. Such revisions are frequently based on estimates and
subjective assessments. The effects of these revisions are recognized in the
period in which the revisions are determined. When such revisions lead to a
conclusion that a loss will be recognized on a contract, the full amount of the
estimated ultimate loss is recognized in the period such a conclusion is
reached, regardless of what stage of completion the contract has reached.
Depending on the size of a particular project, variations from estimated project
costs could have a significant impact on the Company operating results.
Revenues associated with maintenance, repair and monitoring services and
related contracts are recognized as services are performed.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
Accounts receivable include amounts billed but not paid by customers
pursuant to retainage provisions in construction contracts. These amounts are
due upon completion of the contracts and acceptance by the customer. Based on
the Company experience with similar contracts in recent years, the retention
balance at each balance sheet date is billed and collected within the subsequent
year. The retainage balances at December 31, 2000 and 2001 are $677 million and
$605 million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable.

COMFORT SYSTEMS USA, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS IN EXCESS OF BILLINGS
The current asset Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings
represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed under the terms of
the contract. These amounts are billable upon completion of contract performance
milestones or other specified conditions of the contract.
Claims or unapproved change orders represent amounts to be recovered from
the customer or other third parties for errors, changes in specifications or
design or other unanticipated customer-related changes resulting in additional
contract costs. These amounts are recorded as Costs and estimated earnings in
excess of billings at their estimated net realizable amounts when realization
is probable and such amounts can be reasonably estimated. These claims and
unapproved change orders involve estimates which will be revised as additional
information becomes known.
WARRANTY COSTS
The Company typically warrants labor for the first year after installation
on new air conditioning and heating systems. The Company generally warrants
labor for 30 days after servicing of existing air conditioning and heating
systems. A reserve for warranty costs is estimated and recorded based upon the
historical level of warranty claims and management estimate of future costs.
INCOME TAXES
The Company files a consolidated return for federal income tax purposes.
Income taxes are provided for under the liability method in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes, which takes into account differences between financial statement
treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions. Deferred tax assets
represent the tax effect of activity that has been reflected in the financial
statements but which will not be deductible for tax purposes until future
periods. Deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of activity that has
been reflected in the financial statements but which will not be taxable until
future periods.
SEGMENT DISCLOSURE
Comfort Systems' activities are within the mechanical services industry
which is the single industry segment served by the Company. Under SFAS No. 131
Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, each
operating subsidiary represents an operating segment and these segments have
been aggregated, as no individual operating unit is material and the operating
units meet a majority of the aggregation criteria.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions by
management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most
significant estimates used in the Company financial statements include revenue
and cost recognition for construction contracts, allowance for doubtful accounts
and self-insurance accruals.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
The Company provides services to a broad range of geographical regions. The
Company credit risk primarily consists of receivables from a variety of
customers including general contractors, property owners and developers, and
commercial and industrial companies. The Company reviews its accounts receivable
and provides estimates of allowances as deemed necessary.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, receivables from related parties, other receivables,
accounts payable, a line of credit, notes payable, notes payable to related
parties and long-term debt. The Company believes that the carrying values of
these instruments on the accompanying balance sheets approximate their fair
values.
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting
be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No.
141 also specifies criteria for recording intangible assets other than goodwill
in connection with business combinations. SFAS No. 142 requires companies to
assess goodwill assets for impairment each year, and more frequently if
circumstances suggest an impairment may have occurred. SFAS No. 142 also
introduces a more stringent framework for assessing goodwill impairment than the
approach required under existing rules. In addition, SFAS No. 142 discontinues
the regular charge, or amortization, of goodwill assets against income.
SFAS No. 141 took effect upon issuance in July 2001. SFAS No. 142 is
effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2002 and early adoption is not
allowed for calendar year companies. Under SFAS No. 142, any impairment loss
recognized in accordance with the initial adoption will be shown as a cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle in the Company statement of
operations. Under this treatment, the Company statement of operations would
show after-tax results of operations both with and without the cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle recognizing an impairment.
Under previous standards, the Company recognized a non-cash charge of
approximately $12 million per year in its statement of operations through
December 31, 2001 to amortize its goodwill assets over 40-year lives. This
amortization was discontinued beginning January 1, 2002 under the new standard.
The new requirements for assessing whether goodwill assets have been
impaired involve market-based information. Based on a preliminary review of the
new standards, the Company believes that it will record a non-cash, pre-tax
goodwill impairment charge of between $240 million and $260 million. The Company
anticipates that this charge will be recorded in the first quarter of 2002 when
the new standard becomes effective. As noted above, this charge will be
reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
The Company has specifically provided for the possibility of a non-cash
goodwill impairment charge in its lending agreements with its banks and
accordingly, expects no impact on its current bank credit facility as a result
of this charge.
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. This statement supercedes SFAS No. 121
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be Disposed Of, and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB 30,
Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions. Under SFAS No. 144, the operating results of the
companies being sold to EMCOR as discussed in Note 16 as well as any gain or
loss on the sale of these operations will be presented as discontinued
operations in the Company statement of operations for 2002. The Company
believes that the adoption of SFAS No. 144 will not have a material impact on
its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

3. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES   During the first quarter of 2001, the Company recorded restructuring
charges of approximately $02 million, primarily related to contractual
severance obligations of two operating presidents in connection with the
Company significant restructuring program undertaken in the second half of
2000. These restructuring charges are net of a gain of approximately $01
million related to management decision to sell a small operation during the
first quarter of 2001.
As announced by the Company in the third quarter of 2000, management
performed an extensive review of its operations during the second half of 2000.
As part of this review, management decided to cease operating at three
locations, sell five operations including two smaller satellite operations,
and merge two companies into other operations. As a result of these decisions,
the Company estimated and recorded restructuring charges of approximately $253
million, primarily associated with restructuring efforts at certain
underperforming operations and its decision to cease its e-commerce activities
at Outbound Services, a subsidiary of the Company. The restructuring charges
were primarily non-cash and included goodwill impairments of approximately $115
million and the writedown of other long-lived assets of approximately $85
million. The remaining restructuring items primarily include severance and lease
termination costs. These restructuring actions are substantially complete.
During the third quarter of 2001, the Company decided to retain one of the
operations that was previously held for sale and reversed approximately $03
million of non-cash charges related to the anticipated loss on the sale of this
operation. This amount was offset by an additional loss on the sale in late
September 2001 of the final operation that was identified as part of this
restructuring program. The losses associated with the other operations that were
sold were consistent with the amounts recorded as restructuring charges in 2000.
Severance costs recorded in 2000 and 2001 relate to the termination of 147
employees all of whom had been terminated by June 30, 2001 including certain
corporate personnel and the management and employees of certain underperforming
locations, and to the departure of the Company former chief executive officer.

the anticipated sale of these operations.
4. REDUCTIONS IN NON-OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, NET   During 2000, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of approximately $59
million primarily related to the impairment of certain non-operating assets,
principally notes receivable from former owners of businesses acquired by the
Company. This charge also included an impairment of approximately $14 million
to the Company minority investment in two entities associated with the
distribution and implementation of high-end engineering and design software.
These entities have ceased operations. Offsetting these items was a gain of
approximately $06 million on the reduction of the Company subordinated note
payable to a former owner in connection with the settlement of claims with this
former owner.
5. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS   During 1999, the Company acquired 25 businesses which were accounted for as
purchases. These companies provide HVAC and related services. The aggregate
consideration paid in these transactions was $380 million in cash, 1,151,907
shares of the Company common stock Common Stock with a fair value at the
date of acquisition totaling $85 million, $22 million in the form of
convertible subordinated notes and $213 million in the form of subordinated
notes. In addition, the Company received 68,177 shares from a former owner
related to a prior year acquisition. Subsequent to the issuance of certain of
the convertible subordinated notes, the Company entered into agreements with
certain of the convertible noteholders to modify the terms of $21 million of
these notes to eliminate the provisions relating to convertibility into Common
Stock. The remaining convertible subordinated notes are convertible into 5,133
shares of Common Stock. There were no acquisitions in 2000 or 2001.

REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY
The Company principal debt financing is a revolving credit facility the
Credit Facility or the Facility provided by Bank One, Texas, N.A. Bank
One and other banks including Bank One, the Bank Group. As of December 31,
2001, the Credit Facility provided the Company with a revolving line of credit
of up to the lesser of $250 million or 80% of accounts receivable, net of
reserves Net Receivables. Borrowings outstanding under the Facility as of
December 31, 2001 were $1637 million.
In connection with the Company sale of operations to EMCOR as discussed
in Note 16, the Company agreed in February 2002 to pay down debt under the
Facility by at least $130 million, and to reduce the size of the Facility to the
lesser of $100 million or 80% of Net Receivables. This transaction closed on
March 1, 2002. The Company expects that net of taxes, transaction costs, and
escrows, approximately $138 million of the cash proceeds will be used to reduce
its bank debt.
Borrowings under the Facility are secured by accounts receivable,
inventory, fixed assets other than real estate, and the shares of capital stock
of the Company subsidiaries. The Credit Facility expires on January 1, 2003,
at which time all amounts outstanding are due.
The Company has a choice of two interest rate options under the Facility.
Under one option, the interest rate is determined based on the higher of the
Federal Funds Rate plus 05% or Bank One prime rate. An additional margin of
1% to 2% is then added to the higher of these two rates. Under the other
interest rate option, borrowings bear interest based on designated short-term
Eurodollar rates which generally approximate London Interbank Offered Rates or
LIBOR plus 25% to 35%. The additional margin for both options depends on
the ratio of the Company debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization EBITDA, as defined. Commitment fees of 0375% to 05% per
annum, also depending on the ratio of debt to EBITDA, are payable on the unused
portion of the Facility.
The Credit Facility prohibits payment of dividends and the repurchase of
shares by the Company, limits certain non-Bank Group debt, and restricts outlays
of cash by the Company relating to certain investments, capital expenditures,
vehicle leases, acquisitions and subordinate debt. The Credit Facility also
provides for the maintenance of certain levels of shareholder equity and EBITDA,
and for the maintenance of certain ratios of the Company EBITDA to interest
expense and debt to EBITDA.
The Company estimated and recorded an allowance of $35 million in the
fourth quarter of 2001 against its receivables with the Kmart Corporation based
on Kmart bankruptcy filing in January 2002. Including this reserve, the
Company fourth quarter EBITDA did not meet the Facility minimum EBITDA
covenant. The Bank Group agreed to exclude the Kmart reserve from covenant
calculations. As a result, the Company has no unresolved covenant violations
under the Facility.
39
COMFORT SYSTEMS USA, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
As a result of the substantial reduction in debt following the EMCOR
transaction, the Company believes that it currently complies with the Facility
debt to EBITDA and EBITDA to interest expense covenants by comfortable margins.
The Bank Group has agreed to adjust the Facility minimum EBITDA covenants to
reflect the Company reduced size following the EMCOR transaction. While the
Company expects to be in compliance with these new EBITDA requirements, the
minimum EBITDA covenant allows less room for variance than the Facility other
financial covenants. If the Company violates this or any other covenant, it may
have to negotiate new borrowing terms under the Facility. While the Company
believes that its improved creditworthiness following the EMCOR transaction
would result in a successful negotiation of new terms if necessary, there can be
no assurance it could obtain terms acceptable to the Company. In view of these
restrictions, the Facility January 2003 maturity, and the Company improved
creditworthiness, the Company has started the process of seeking more flexible
borrowing arrangements.
As of December 31, 2001, the Company had $1637 million in borrowings
outstanding under the Credit Facility and had incurred interest expense at an
average rate of approximately 87% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The
Company also had $24 million in letters of credit outstanding under the
Facility at yearend. While not actual borrowings, letters of credit do reflect
potential liabilities under the Facility and therefore are treated by the Bank
Group as a use of borrowing capacity under the Facility. Unused borrowing
capacity under the Facility based upon the most restrictive covenant was $307
million as of December 31, 2001.
As of March 4, 2002, the Company had $247 million outstanding under the
Facility as a result of using proceeds from the EMCOR transaction to reduce its
borrowings, and unused borrowing capacity of approximately $501 million under
the Facility. The Company expects to make payments of taxes and other costs
related to the EMCOR transaction of approximately $19 million in early second
quarter of 2002. This would have resulted in $437 million outstanding under the
Facility as of March 4, 2002, if these payments had been made contemporaneously
with the closing of the EMCOR transaction. The Company estimates its current
all-in floating interest rate under the Facility to be approximately 61%.
In connection with the reduction of the Facility size as well as the
Company expectation of obtaining new debt arrangements as noted above, the
Company expects to write off in the first quarter of 2002 as much as $12
million, before tax benefits, of deferred arrangement fees associated with its
current Facility.
NOTES TO AFFILIATES AND FORMER OWNERS
Subordinated notes were issued to former owners of certain purchased
companies as part of the consideration used to acquire their companies. These
notes had an outstanding balance of $410 million as of December 31, 2001. These
notes bear interest, payable quarterly, at a weighted average interest rate of
97%. In addition, $06 million of these notes are convertible by the holders
into shares of the Company Common Stock at a weighted average price of $2425
per share.
In connection with the Company sale of operations to EMCOR as discussed
in Note 16, $221 million of subordinate debt was assumed by EMCOR. As a result
of this assumption as well as scheduled principal payments that have already
occurred in 2002, the outstanding balance of subordinate debt as of March 4,
2002 was $184 million. The maturities on this remaining debt are $29 million
in 2002 and $155 million in 2003. Substantially all of the 2003 maturities are
due on April 10, 2003.
OTHER LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS DISCLOSURES
The Company estimates the fair value of long-term debt as of December 31,
2000 and 2001 to be approximately the same as the recorded value.
The Company anticipates that cash flow from operations as well as
borrowings under lending facilities will be sufficient to meet the Company
normal cash needs. As noted above, the Company has certain
40

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
relatively tight restrictions under the Credit Facility. If the Company violates
these or certain other restrictions under the Facility, it may be required to
negotiate new terms with its banks. While the Company believes that its improved
creditworthiness following the EMCOR transaction would result in a successful
negotiation of new terms if necessary, there can be no assurance that it could
obtain terms acceptable to the Company. In view of these restrictions, the
Facility January 2003 maturity, and the Company improved creditworthiness,
the Company has started the process of seeking more flexible borrowing
arrangements.

10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS   The Company and certain of the Company subsidiaries sponsor various
retirement plans for most full-time and some part-time employees. These plans
consist of defined contribution plans and multi-employer pension plans and cover
employees at substantially all of the Company operating locations. The defined
contribution plans generally provide for contributions ranging from 1% to 6% of
covered employees' salaries or wages and totaled $54 million for 1999, $59
million for 2000 and $60 million for 2001. Of these amounts                     42
COMFORT SYSTEMS USA, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
approximately $29 million and $24 million was payable to the plans at December
31, 2000 and 2001, respectively.
Certain of the Company subsidiaries also participate in various
multi-employer pension plans for the benefit of their employees who are union
members. Company contributions to these plans were approximately $146 million
for 1999, $177 million for 2000 and $197 million for 2001. The data available
from administrators of the multi-employer pension plans is not sufficient to
determine the accumulated benefit obligations, nor the net assets attributable
to the multi-employer plans in which Company employees participate.
11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  LEASES
The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under noncancelable
operating leases. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and
2001 was $175 million, $250 million and $268 million, respectively.
Concurrent with the acquisitions of certain acquired companies, the Company
entered into various agreements with previous owners to lease land and buildings
used in the Company operations. The terms of these leases range from three to
ten years and provide for certain escalations in the rental expenses each year.
Included in the 1999, 2000 and 2001 rent expense above is approximately $61
million, $80 million and $94 million of rent paid to these related parties,
respectively. The following represents future minimum rental payments under
noncancelable operating leases in thousands

CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS
The Company is party to litigation in the ordinary course of business.
There are currently no pending legal proceedings that, in management opinion,
would have a material adverse effect on the Company operating results or
financial condition. The Company has estimated and provided accruals for
probable losses and legal fees associated with certain of these actions in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.
SELF-INSURANCE
The Company retains the risk for worker compensation, employer
liability, auto liability, general liability and employee group health claims
resulting from uninsured deductibles per accident or occurrence. Losses up to
the deductible amounts are estimated and accrued based upon the Company known
claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. The
accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends, and management
believes such accruals to be adequate. A wholly-owned insurance company
subsidiary reinsures a portion of the risk associated with surety bonds issued
by a third party insurance

COMFORT SYSTEMS USA, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
company. Because no claims have been made against these financial instruments in
the past, management does not expect these instruments will have a material
effect on the Company consolidated financial statements.
12. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY  TREASURY STOCK
On October 5, 1999, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had
approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to buy up to 40
million shares of its Common Stock. During 1999, the Company purchased
approximately 18 million shares at a cost of approximately $129 million.
During 2000, the Company purchased approximately 02 million shares at a cost of
approximately $12 million. Under the current terms of the Credit Facility, the
Company is prohibited from purchasing additional shares of its Common Stock.
RESTRICTED COMMON STOCK
In March 1997, Notre Capital Ventures II, L.L.C. Notre exchanged
2,742,912 shares of Common Stock for an equal number of shares of restricted
voting common stock Restricted Voting Common Stock. The holders of
Restricted Voting Common Stock are entitled to elect one member of the Company
Board of Directors and to 055 of one vote for each share on all other matters
on which they are entitled to vote. Holders of Restricted Voting Common Stock
are not entitled to vote on the election of any other directors.
Each share of Restricted Voting Common Stock will automatically convert to
Common Stock on a share-for-share basis i in the event of a disposition of
such share of Restricted Voting Common Stock by the holder thereof other than a
distribution which is a distribution by a holder to its partners or beneficial
owners, or a transfer to a related party of such holders as defined in Sections
267, 707, 318 and/or 4946 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
ii in the event any person acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the
total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company, or iii in
the event any person offers to acquire 15% or more of the total number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company. After July 1, 1998, the Board
of Directors may elect to convert any remaining shares of Restricted Voting
Common Stock into shares of Common Stock in the event 80% or more of the
originally outstanding shares of Restricted Voting Common Stock have been
previously converted into shares of Common Stock. As of December 31, 2001, there
are 1,240,412 shares of Restricted Voting Common Stock remaining.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS is computed considering the dilutive effect of stock options and
convertible subordinated notes. Options to purchase 40 million shares of Common
Stock at prices ranging from $363 to $21438 per share were outstanding as of
December 31, 2001, but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS
because the options' exercise prices were greater than the respective average
market price of the Common Stock. Options had an anti-dilutive effect for the
year ended December 31, 2000 because the Company reported a net loss during this
period, and therefore, were not included in the diluted EPS calculation. The
Company would have included 175,767 shares related to the dilutive impact of
stock options for the year ended December 31, 2000 if it were not for the net
loss during the period. Diluted EPS is also computed by adjusting both net
earnings and shares outstanding as if the conversion of the convertible
subordinated notes occurred on the first day of the year. The convertible
subordinated notes had an anti-dilutive effect during the years ended December
31, 2000 and 2001, and therefore, are not included in the diluted EPS
calculation. The after-tax interest expense related to the assumed conversion of
the convertible subordinated notes in 1999 was $08 million.

13. STOCK OPTION PLANS  LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS
In March 1997, the Company stockholders approved the Company 1997
Long-Term Incentive Plan which provides for the granting or awarding of
incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
or deferred stock, dividend equivalents or other incentive awards to directors,
officers, key employees and consultants to the Company.
The Company 1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for the granting of
options to key employees to purchase an aggregate of not more than 13% of the
total number of shares of the Company Common Stock outstanding at the time of

on the first anniversary of the date of grant. The options expire after seven
years from the date of grant if unexercised. Outstanding options may be canceled
and reissued under terms specified in the plan.
In May 2000, the Company stockholders approved the Company 2000
Incentive Plan which provides for the granting or awarding of incentive or
non-qualified stock options, restricted stock or performance awards to
directors, officers, key employees and other persons or entities as approved by
the Board of Directors. Options granted under this plan have been issued by the
Company at fair market value on the date of grant and become exercisable in four
equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of
grant. The options expire after ten years from the date of grant if unexercised.
The Company has never altered the price of any option after its grant.

In September 1997, the Company stockholders approved the Company 1998
Employee Stock Purchase Plan which allows employees to purchase shares from the
Company authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock or from shares of
Common Stock reacquired by the Company, including shares repurchased on the open
market.
The Company 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan originally provided for the
purchase of up to 300,000 shares, which was increased by an additional 600,000
shares in May 2000, at semi-annual intervals. In March 2001, after all of the
shares were distributed, the Board of Directors of the Company voted to suspend
the Employee Stock Purchase Plan indefinitely. Through the suspension date,
full-time employees were eligible to purchase shares with payroll deductions
ranging from 2% to 8% of compensation with a maximum deduction of $2,000 for any
purchase period for each participant. The purchase price per share is 85% of the
lower of the market price on the first business day of the purchase period or
the purchase date.
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation under Accounting
Principles Board Statement No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
APB 25. Under this accounting method, no expense in connection with the
stock option plan or the stock purchase plan is recognized in the consolidated
statements of operations when the exercise price of the stock options is greater
than or equal to the value of the Common Stock on the date of grant. In October
1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
which requires that if a company accounts for stock-based compensation in
accordance with APB 25, the company must also disclose the effects on its
results of operations as if an estimate of the value of stock-based compensation
at the date of grant was recorded as an expense in the

respectively.
NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS' STOCK PLAN
In March 1997, the Company stockholders approved the 1997 Non-Employee
Directors' Stock Plan the Directors' Plan, which provides for the granting
or awarding of stock options and stock appreciation rights to non-employees. The
number of shares authorized and reserved for issuance under the Directors' Plan
is 250,000 shares. The Directors' Plan provided for the automatic grant of
options to purchase 10,000 shares to each non-employee director serving at the
commencement of the initial public offering of the Company.
Each non-employee director will be granted options to purchase 10,000
shares at the time of the initial election. In addition, each non-employee
director is automatically granted options to purchase an additional 5,000 shares
at each annual meeting of the stockholders that is more than two months after
the date of the director initial election.
All options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market
value at the date of grant and are immediately vested upon grant.
47
COMFORT SYSTEMS USA, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Either at the time of the initial public offering or upon election as a
director, options were granted to four members of the board of directors to
purchase in each case 10,000 shares of Common Stock at the initial public
offering price or at the price in effect at the time of their election. Each of
these directors received an option for 5,000 shares on the dates of the annual
meetings which they have attended. In addition, directors who cease to be
employees become eligible for the annual grant. One former employee received an
annual grant in 2000. These options will expire at the earlier of 10 years from
the date of grant or one year after termination of service as a director. As of
December 31, 2001, 105,000 options were outstanding related to this plan.
The Directors' Plan allows non-employee directors to receive shares
Deferred Shares at future settlement dates in lieu of cash. The number of
Deferred Shares will have an aggregate fair market value equal to the fees
payable to the directors. No Deferred Shares have been issued as of December 31,
2001.
14. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   One of the Company subsidiaries performs contracting services for an
entity partially owned by a director of the Company. Total revenues from this
related party were $68 million, $100 million and $49 million during 1999,
2000 and 2001, respectively. The balance included in accounts receivable at
December 31, 2000 and 2001 was $11 million and $19 million, respectively.
One of the Company subsidiaries subcontracts sheet metal services from an
entity owned by a director of the Company. Total purchases from this related
party were $38 million, $96 million and $56 million during 1999, 2000 and
2001, respectively. The balance due included in accounts payable at December 31,
2000 and 2001 was $15 million and $09 million, respectively.

a During the second quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a non-cash, pre-tax
charge of approximately $52 million primarily related to the impairment of
certain non-operating assets see Note 4.
b During the third quarter of 2000, the Company recorded pre-tax
restructuring charges of approximately $100 million associated primarily
with restructuring efforts at certain underperforming operations see Note
3.
c During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recorded an additional
pre-tax charge of $07 million related to the impairment of certain
non-operating assets. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2000, the
Company recorded additional pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately
$150 million primarily related to restructuring efforts at certain
underperforming operations and its decision to cease its e-commerce
activities at Outbound Services see Notes 3 and 4.
16. SUBSEQUENT EVENT   On February 11, 2002, the Company entered into an agreement with EMCOR to
sell 19 operations. Under the terms of the agreement, the total purchase price
is approximately $18625 million, including debt assumed by EMCOR of
approximately $221 million of subordinated notes to former owners of certain of
the divested companies. This transaction closed on March 1, 2002. The Company
expects that net of taxes, transaction costs, and escrows, approximately $160
million of this amount will be used to reduce debt. In addition, the Company
expects that it will take certain steps to reduce its costs in light of the
smaller size of the Company following the EMCOR transaction. As a result, the
Company currently expects it will record restructuring charges of not less than
$1 million, before taxes, in the first quarter of 2002.
Under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets, which takes effect for the Company on January 1, 2002, the
operating results of units being sold as well as any gain or loss on the sale of
these operations will be presented as discontinued operations in the Company
statement of operations for the first quarter of 2002. This reporting will be
separate from income statement items for ongoing operations. Based on estimates
of the net assets of these operations and on estimates of transaction costs, the
Company expects to realize an estimated loss on the sale of these operations of
approximately $27 million in the first quarter of 2002, exclusive of tax
liabilities. Approximately $67 million of this loss will be included in the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as a result of the
adoption of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. See Note 2 for
further discussion.
