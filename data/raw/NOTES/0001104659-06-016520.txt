41 Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Zoran Corporation We have completed integrated audits of Zoran
Corporations 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, and an audit
of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our
opinions, based on our audits, are presented below. Consolidated financial statements
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying indexpresent fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Zoran Corporation and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Internal control over financial reporting
Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in Managements
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A,
that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal
Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the
COSO. The Companys management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on managements assessment andon the effectiveness of
the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. An audit of internal
control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A companys internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

CORPORATION
NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE1THE
COMPANY Zoran Corporation Zoran or the Company was incorporated in
California in December1981 and reincorporated in Delaware in
November1986. Zoran develops and
markets integrated circuits, integrated circuit cores and embedded software
used by original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, in digital audio and video
products for commercial and consumer markets, digital television applications
as well as digital imaging products.
Current applications incorporating Zorans products and IP include digital
versatile disc, or DVD, players and recorders, digital cameras, professional
and consumer video editing systems, digital speakers and audio systems,
applications that enable the delivery and display of digital video content
through a set top box or television as well as digital imaging products
consisting of semiconductor hardware and software that enable users to print,
scan, process and transmit documents to computer peripherals that perform
printing functions. The Company operates
in four industry segments; DVD, Imaging, Mobile and Digital Television. Risk and
Uncertainties The Company performs research and development and generates a
significant portion of its sales from its operations located in the State of
Israel. A significant number of the
Companys full-time employees are located in Israel, including a portion of the
Companys research and development personnel.
Therefore, the Company is directly affected by the political, economic
and military conditions to which that country is subject. The semiconductor business is highly cyclical and has been subject to
significant downturns at various times that have been characterized by
diminished product demand, decreased production, overcapacity, and accelerated
erosion of average selling prices. As
such, the selling price that the Company is able to command for its products is
highly dependent on industry-wide production capacity and demand. Both of these factors could result in rapid
deviations in product pricing and, therefore, could adversely affect the
Companys operating results. The Companys revenues may be impacted by its ability to obtain
adequate wafer supplies from its foundries.
The foundries with which the Company currently has arrangements,
together with any additional foundry at which capacity might be obtained, may
not be willing or able to satisfy all of the Companys manufacturing
requirements on a timely basis at favorable prices. In addition, the Company could experience
delays in qualifying new products and in ramping-up new product
production. The Company is also subject
to the risks of service disruptions, raw material shortages and price increases
by its foundries. The Company depends on independent subcontractors to assemble and test
its products. The Companys reliance on
these subcontractors involves the following significant risks Reduced control over delivery schedules and
quality The potential lack of adequate capacity during
periods of strong demand Difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontracts Potential increase in prices due to capacity
shortages and other factors; and Potential misappropriation of the Companys
intellectual property. Principles of
consolidation and basis of presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Zoran and
all of its subsidiaries. Intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 47 ZORAN
CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued NOTE2SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES Zoran has adopted accounting policies which are generally accepted in
the industry in which it operates. The
following is a summary of the Companys significant accounting policies. Use of estimates The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles in the Unites States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates, although such differences are not expected to be material to the
consolidated financial statements. Translation of
foreign currencies The majority of the Companys purchasing and sales transactions are
denominated in US dollars, which is considered to be the functional currency of
the Company and its subsidiaries. The
Company has not experienced material losses or gains as a result of currency
exchange rate fluctuations and has not engaged in hedging transactions to
reduce its exposure to such fluctuations.
The Company may take action in the future to reduce its foreign exchange
risk. Monetary assets and liabilities of
the Companys foreign subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars from the
local currency at rates in effect at period-end and non-monetary assets and
liabilities are remeasured at historical rates.
Revenues and expenses are remeasured at average rates during the period. In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 52, gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of
local currency financial statements are included in other income loss, net
and have not been significant for any of the periods presented. Revenue recognition The Companys policy is to recognize revenue from product sales upon
shipment, provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price
is fixed and determinable, collectibility is reasonably assured and legal title
and risk of ownership has transferred. A
provision for estimated future returns and potential warranty liability is
recorded at the time revenue is recognized.
Warranty expenses in 2005, 2004 and 2003, were immaterial. Development revenue under development
contracts is recognized as the services are performed based on the specific
deliverables outlined in each contract.
Amounts received in advance of performance under contracts are recorded
as deferred revenue and are recognized when our obligations have been met. Costs associated with development revenues
are included primarily in research and development expenses. Revenue resulting from the licensing of the
Companys technology is recognized when significant contractual obligations
have been fulfilled and the customer has indicated acceptance. Periodic service and maintenance fees which
provide customers access to technical support and minor enhancements to
licensed releases are recognized ratably over the service or maintenance
period. Royalty revenue is recognized in
the period licensed sales are reported to the Company which typically ranges
between one month to one quarter in arrears. Research and
development costs Research and development expenses are charged to operations as
incurred. Costs related to the
conceptual formation and design of internally developed software are expensed
as research and development as incurred.
It is the Companys policy that certain internal software development
costs incurred after technological feasibility has been demonstrated and which
meet recoverability tests are capitalized and amortized over the estimated
economic life of the product. To date,
the Company has incurred no significant internal software development costs
which meet the criteria for capitalization. Cash equivalents and
investments All highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of
90days or less are considered to be cash equivalents. All of the Companys investments in marketable securities are
classified as available-for-sale and, therefore, are reported at fair value with
unrealized gains and losses, net of related tax, if any, included as
accumulated other comprehensive income loss, a component of stockholders
equity. Gains and losses realized upon
sales of all such securities are reported in interest income. See Note3. When the fair value of an investment declines below its amortized cost,
we consider all available evidence to evaluate whether an other-than-temporary
decline in value has occurred. Among
other things, we consider the duration and extent to which the market value has
declined relative to our cost basis, the economic factors influencing the
markets, the relative performance of the investee and its near-term prospects. 48 ZORAN
CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued At December31, 2005, the Companys marketable securities included
commercial paper and marketable equity securities. Investments in marketable securities at
December 31, 2004 also included bonds and medium term notes with maturities
greater than one year, which are included in other assets and investments, and
amounted to $528million. See
Note3. Other assets and investments also include investments in non-marketable
securities which are accounted for on the cost basis and amounted to
$52million and $47 million at December31, 2005 and 2004. The Company records an investment impairment
charge when the fair value of an investment declines below its cost basis. In making this determination the Company considers
all available evidence including the historical and projected financial
performance and recent funding events which are ascertained from an
investee. There were no such charges in
2005 or 2004. Concentration of
credit risk of financial instruments Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash
equivalents, investments in marketable securities, non-marketable equity
securities and trade accounts receivable.
The Company places its cash in banks and cash equivalents consist
primarily of certificates of deposit and commercial paper. The Companys marketable securities portfolio
consists primarily of auction rate securities, stock, corporate bonds, short
and medium term notes, Euro dollar bonds and US Government securities. The Company, by policy, limits the amount of
its credit exposure through diversification and restricting its investments to
highly rated securities. Individual securities are limited to comprising no
more than 10% of the portfolio value at the time of purchase. Highly rated securities are defined as having
a minimum Moody or Standard Poors rating of A2 or A respectively. The average maturity of the portfolio shall
not exceed 24 months. The Company has
not experienced any significant losses on its cash equivalents or short-term
investment. The Company markets integrated circuits and technology to manufacturers
and distributors of electronic equipment primarily in North America, Europe and
the Pacific Rim. The Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and limits the
amount of credit extended when deemed necessary, but generally does not require
collateral. Management believes that any
risk of loss is significantly reduced due to the diversity of its customers and
geographic sales areas. As of
December31, 2005, one customer accounted for approximately 14% of the net
accounts receivable balance. As of
December31, 2004, two customers accounted for approximately 27% and 13%
of the net accounts receivable balance, respectively. Inventory Inventories
are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a
first-in, first-out basis or market.
Market is based on estimated net realizable value. The Company writes down inventories to net
realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions. Inventory write-downs are not reversed and
permanently reduce the cost basis of the affected inventory until such
inventory is sold or scrapped. Property and
equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of three to five
years. Leasehold improvements are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful
lives of the assets or the remaining term of the lease. Goodwill In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
Statement No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS142 goodwill is not amortized. The Company monitors the recoverability of
goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions, by reporting unit, annually,
or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. For each of the years ended December31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company performed the annual analysis and concluded
that goodwill was not impaired, as the fair value of each reporting unit
exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill. 49 ZORAN
CORPORATION
NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Other Intangibles Acquired technology is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis
over two to five years. Other intangible
assets recorded in connection with the acquisitions of Oak
Technology,Inc., Emblaze
Semiconductor, Ltd and Oren Semiconductor, Inc. are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated periods of benefit, which range between
three and five years. Long-lived assets The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets,
other than goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate the
carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates these assets by
comparing expected undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the related
assets. If the expected undiscounted
cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the Company
recognizes an impairment charge based on the fair value of the assets. To date, the Company has not recorded any
impairment charges against the value of its long-lived assets. Fair value of
financial instruments The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the
instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing
parties. The carrying amounts for cash
and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts
payable and accrued liabilities approximate their respective fair values
because of the short-term maturity of these items. Income taxes The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes
which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the
expected future tax consequence of temporary differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the provision for income taxes
reflects the effective tax rate applied to earnings, excluding charges related
to the amortization of goodwill and the write-off of acquired in-process
research and development, for the periods.
The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate due to
utilization of net operating losses and State of Israel tax benefits on foreign
earnings. The provision includes
primarily taxes on income in excess of net operating loss carryover limitations
and foreign withholding taxes. Earnings per share In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128,
Zoran reports Earnings per Share EPS, both basic and diluted, on the
consolidated statement of operations.
Basic EPS is based upon the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed
using the weighted average common shares outstanding plus any potential common
stock, except when their effect is anti-dilutive. Potential common stock includes common stock
issuable upon the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units. See Note12. Stock based
compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the
intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees and related interpretations. Under APB 25, compensation expense is
recognized based on the difference, if any, on the date of grant between the
fair value of the Companys stock and the amount an employee must pay to
acquire the stock. The compensation
expense is recognized over the periods the employee performs the related
services, generally the vesting period of four years, consistent with the
multiple option method described in FASB Interpretation No. 28 FIN 28.
Stock based compensation includes the amortization of restricted stock units
and the amortization of certain stock options assumed as part of acquisitions.
No other stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net

on marketable securities, net of related taxes. Recent accounting pronouncements In December2004, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123R, Share-Based Payment, an Amendment of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards 123 SFAS 123R. On April14, 2005, the SEC adopted a new
ruleextending the compliance dates for SFAS 123R. In accordance with the new rule, the
accounting provisions of SFAS 123R will be effective for the Company in
2006. SFAS 123R requires companies to
recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock
options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees. SFAS123R requires the use of an option
pricing model for estimating fair value, which is amortized to expense over the
service periods. SFAS123R allows
for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective
recognition, which may be back to the original issuance of
SFASNo123, or only to interim periods in the year of adoption. On
March29, 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No107 SAB
107. This staff accounting bulletin
expresses views of the staff regarding the interaction between SFAS 123R and
certain SEC rulesand regulations and the valuation of share-based payment
arrangements for public companies. Management is currently evaluating the
impact of adopting SFAS 123R; however, it believes the adoption of
SFAS123R will have a significant impact on net loss and net loss per
share. The impact on the Companys
financial statements will be dependent on the transition method, the
option-pricing model used to compute fair value and the inputs to that model
such as volatility and expected life.
The pro-forma disclosures of the impact of SFAS 123 provided in Note 2
to the Consolidated Financial Statements may not be representative of the
impact of adopting SFAS 123R. In May2005, the FASB
issued Statement of Financial Accounting standards No154, Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections SFAS 154.
SFAS 154 replaces APB Opinion No20, Accounting Changes, and
SFAS No3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements.
SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial
statements of changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to
determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the
change. SFAS 154 will be effective for all periods beginning after
December15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 154 is not expected to have a material effect on
the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. In November2005, the
FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. This FSP addresses the determination as to
when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other
than temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. This FSP also
includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of
other-than-temporary impairments. The guidance in this FSP will be applied to
reporting periods beginning after December15, 2005. The adoption of this
FSP is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 52 ZORAN CORPORATION

amortized. The Company monitors the
recoverability of goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions, by
reporting unit, annually, or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For each of the years ended
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company performed the annual
analysis and concluded that goodwill was not impaired, as the fair value of
each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill. Components

AND DEVELOPMENT ARRANGEMENTS The Company is a party to
certain research and development agreements with the Chief Scientist in Israels
Ministry of Industry and Trade Department the Chief Scientist and the
Israel-United States Binational Industrial Research and Development
Foundation BIRDF, which fund up to 50% of incurred project costs for
approved products up to specified contract maximums. The Company is not obligated to repay funding
regardless of the outcome of its development efforts; however, these agreements
require the Company to use its best efforts to achieve specified results and
require the Company to pay royalties at rates of 3% to 5% of resulting products
sales, and up to 30% of resulting license revenues, up to a maximum of 100% to
150% of the total funding received.
Reported research and development expenses incurred in Israel are net of
these grants, which fluctuate from period to period. Research and development expenses that qualify for the grants and the

$654,000 and $40,600 in 2004 and 2003, respectively. NOTE7DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS The Company has generated a portion of its total revenues from
development contracts, primarily with key customers. The Company classifies costs related to these
development contracts as research and development expenses. The Company is not obligated to repay funding
regardless of the outcome of its development efforts; however, the agreements
require the Company to use its best efforts to achieve specified results as per
the agreements. The Company retains
ownership of the intellectual property developed under the contracts; however,
some contracts limit the product markets in which the Company may directly sell
the developed product. Revenues
generated under these contracts were $32 million in 2005, $16 million in 2004
and $14million in 2003. In
addition, from time to time, we enter into non-refundable joint
development projects in which our customers reimburse us for a portion of our
development costs. We classify such
reimbursement of development costs as an offset to research and development
expenses as we retain ownership of the intellectual property developed by us
under these development arrangements.
During 2005, we received approximately $12 million in such
reimbursements. We did not receive any
reimbursements in 2004 or 2003. NOTE8COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES From time to time, the Company may have certain contingent liabilities
that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. The Company accrues contingent liabilities
when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures
can be reasonably estimated. In the
opinion of management, there are no pending claims of which the outcome is
expected to result in a material adverse effect in the financial position,
results of operations or cash flows of the Company. Lease and license commitments The Company rents facilities
and equipment under various lease and license agreements expiring through
2016. Rent expense for 2005, 2004 and
2003 totaled approximately $56 million, $44 million and $31million,
respectively. The Company also entered
into a time based license agreement for the right to use certain intellectual
property. Future minimum lease and license payments required under

Legal proceedings Zoran and its subsidiary,
Oak Technology,Inc., have been involved in five separate legal actions
against MediaTek,Inc. and customers of MediaTek based on claims of patent
infringement. On March11, 2004,
Zoran and Oak filed a complaint with the
United States International Trade Commission ITC alleging that certain
MediaTek DVD player and optical disk controller chips and chipsets, and
products in which they are used, infringe Zorans and Oaks patents. In addition to MediaTek, the complaint named
a number of other proposed respondents that sell products, including DVD
players and PC optical storage devices that use MediaTeks chips and
chipsets. On September28, 2005,
the ITC issued its final ruling finding one of Zorans patents to be valid and
infringed by optical disk controller chips and chipsets sold by MediaTek and by
products using the infringing chips and chipsets sold by a number of MediaTek
customers. The ITC also issued an
exclusion order prohibiting MediaTek and specified MediaTek customers from
importing into the United States any optical disk controller chip or chipset
that infringes the Zoran patent, or any optical disk storage product containing
such a chip or chipset and cease and desist orders to the affected companies
located in the United States prohibiting them from importing or selling
infringing products in the United 56 ZORAN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued States. In November 2005, both parties filed notices
of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On January19, 2006, the court issued an
order temporarily staying enforcement of the ITCs orders. On March15, 2004,
Zoran and Oak filed a complaint against MediaTek and one of its customers in
the United States District Court, Central District of California alleging
similar facts regarding infringement by MediaTeks chips and chipsets and
products in which they are used. The
lawsuit sought both monetary damages and an injunction to stop the importation
and sale of infringing products. The
complaint was subsequently amended to name additional MediaTek customers as
defendants. Trial of this case was set to
begin May15, 2006. On July23, 2004,
MediaTek filed a complaint with the ITC alleging that certain Zoran and Oak DVD
player and optical disk controller chips and chipsets infringe two MediaTek
patents. The complaint requested that
the ITC institute an investigation into the accused products and issue
exclusion and cease and desist orders prohibiting importation into the United
States of allegedly infringing chips and products that contain them. On September30, 2005, the ITC
Administrative Law Judge issued his initial determination finding that none of
Zorans optical disk controller chips infringe any claim of the two patents
asserted against Zoran; that one of the two patents is invalid; that Oaks
devices do not infringe one of the two patents asserted against Oak and that
the other patent is invalid; and that MediaTek has failed to establish that it
has a domestic industry in the United States related to the patents at
issue a basic requirement for obtaining relief from the ITC. The initial determination was subject to
review by the full ITC. The target date
for completion of the investigation was March1, 2006. On July23, 2004,
MediaTek filed a complaint against Zoran and Oak in the United States District
Court, District of Delaware alleging infringement of the same two patents
asserted in MediaTeks ITC complaint and seeking monetary damages and
injunctive relief. This action was
stayed by order of the court on October4, 2004. On February2, 2005,
MediaTek filed a complaint against Zoran and Zoran Digital Technologies
Shenzhen Ltd. Zorans local Chinese operations in the Shenzhen Peoples
Republic of China court alleging infringement of the Chinese counterpart patent
of one of the two patents asserted in MediaTeks ITC complaint and seeking
monetary damages. Because Zoran had not
been served with the complaint, the initiation of the proceeding has been
stayed. On January25, 2006, Zoran and Oak entered into
an agreement with MediaTek to settle the litigation. Under the agreement, each party agreed to
dismiss its respective claims and counterclaims under all of the pending
lawsuits. The parties also agreed to
dismiss all proceedings pending against each other before the ITC, including
all appeals and enforcement proceedings pending before the ITC, United States
Customs and Border Protection and the United States Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit related to the ITCs September28, 2005 order excluding
the importation into the United States of certain MediaTek chips and products
incorporating those chips. In connection with the settlement, Zoran, Oak and MediaTek
entered into agreements granting each other non-exclusive licenses under the
patents that were the subject of the litigation, and additional patents used in
the design and manufacture of optical storage devices for personal computer
products. In consideration for licenses
granted by Zoran, MediaTek agreed to make a cash payment of $55million to
Zoran, $44 million of which was paid in February 2006 and $11million of
which is payable in April 2006. In addition, MediaTek will be required to make
royalty payments of up to $30million over the 30-month period commencing
on the date of the agreement based on future sales of covered MediaTek
products. Net of amounts payable by
Zoran to a holder of rights under the Oak patents involved in the litigation, and
amounts payable as legal fees, Zoran will realize approximately
$275million of the cash payment and up to approximately $15million
of the future royalty payments. NOTE 9RESTRUCTURING During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company
recorded restructuring charges of $746,000 due to the discontinuation of the
Sensor product line of the Mobile group.
These charges included $523,000 related to the reduction in force of 15
employees for severance and other termination expenses, $173,000 for lease losses
on abandoned office space and other miscellaneous legal and consulting fees of
approximately $50,000. The remaining

Directors for at least six months the Annual Grant. Initial Grants were exercisable in four equal
annual installments, and each Annual Grant became exercisable in full one year
after the date of grant, subject to the directors continuous service. The exercise price of all stock options
granted under the 1995 Directors Plan was equal to the fair market value of the
Companys Common Stock on the date of grant. Options granted under the 1995 Directors
Plan have a term of ten years. This plan
was terminated in July 2005 and was replaced by the 2005 Outside Directors Equity Plan. 2005
Equity Incentive Plan The 2005 Equity Incentive Plan the 2005
Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in May 2005 and replaced the 1993
Stock Option Plan, which expired in 2003, and the 2000 Nonstatutory Stock
Option Plan, which was terminated by the Board of Directors upon stockholder
approval of the 2005 Plan in July 2005.
A total of 1,800,000 shares of the Companys common stock is authorized
for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the 2005 Plan. Such awards may include stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance
shares, performance units, deferred stock units and other stock-based or
cash-based awards. Up to an additional
1,250,000 shares may be issued in the form of restricted stock or upon
settlement of restricted stock units issued or other full value awards issued under
the 2005 Plan in replacement of stock options cancelled in an option exchange
program approved by the stockholders.
The 2005 Plan is generally administered by the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors and has a term of 10 years. Participation in the 2005 Plan is limited to
employees and consultants of Zoran and its subsidiaries and other affiliates. Options and stock appreciation rights granted
under the 2005 Plan must have exercise prices per share not less than the fair
market 58 ZORAN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued value of Zoran common stock on the date of
grant and may not be repriced without stockholder approval. Such awards will vest and become exercisable
upon conditions established by the Compensation Committee and may not have a
term exceeding 10 years. Except with respect to 5% of the number of
shares authorized under the 2005 Plan, awards of restricted stock, restricted
stock units, performance shares, performance units and other full value awards
granted under the 2005 Plan generally must have service-based vesting schedules
of at least three years or a performance period of at least 12 months. However, restricted stock or restricted stock
units issued pursuant to a stockholder-approved option exchange program which
vest based on service must have a vesting schedule of at least two years. Performance share and performance unit awards
vest to the extent that pre-established performance goals based on one or more
measures of business and financial performance authorized by the 2005 Plan are
attained during a performance period established by the Compensation
Committee. The grant or vesting of other
types of awards under the 2005 Plan may similarly be based on the attainment of
one or more such performance goals. The
2005 Plan provides that the number of shares remaining available for issuance
will be reduced by 13 shares for each one share of Zoran common stock subject
to a full value award granted under the 2005 Plan. At December31, 2005, 1,279,762 shares of the Companys common
stock were available for the grant of the options and other awards under the
2005 Plan, subject to the provisions described above that reduce the number of
shares available for full value awards. 2005
Outside Directors Equity Plan The 2005 Outside Directors Equity Plan the 2005
Directors Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in May 2005 and replaced
the 1995 Outside Directors Stock Option Plan, which was terminated by the Board
of Directors upon stockholder approval of the Directors Plan in July 2005. A total of 600,000 shares of the Companys
common stock is authorized for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the
2005 Directors Plan. Such awards may
include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and
deferred stock units. The 2005 Directors
Plan is generally administered by the Board of Directors and has a term of 10
years. Participation in the 2005 Directors
Plan is limited to non-employee members of the Zoran Board of Directors outside
directors. The 2005 Directors Plan
provides that the number of shares remaining available for issuance will be
reduced by 13 shares for each one share of Zoran common stock subject to a
full value award granted under the 2005 Directors Plan. Awards under the 2005 Directors Plan are
granted by the Board of Directors to all outside directors on a periodic,
nondiscriminatory basis within limits prescribed by the 2005 Directors
Plan. Subject to appropriate adjustment
for any change in the Companys capital structure, awards granted to any
outside director in any fiscal year may not exceed 20,000 shares, increased by
one or more of the following: 40,000 shares upon an outside directors initial
election, 10,000 shares for service as Chairman of the Board or Lead Director,
5,000 shares for service on a Board committee as chairman and 2,500 shares for
service on a Board committee other than as chairman. Stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted under the Directors
Plan are generally subject to terms substantially similar to those applicable
to the same type of award granted under the 2005 Plan. At December31, 2005, 510,000 shares of the Companys common stock
were available for the grant of the options and other awards under the 2005 Directors
Plan, subject to the provisions described above that reduce the number of
shares available for full value awards. 59 ZORAN CORPORATION

1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Companys 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP was adopted by
the Companys Board of Directors in October1995, and approved by its
stockholders in December1995. The
ESPP enables employees to purchase shares through payroll deductions at
approximately 85% of the lesser of the fair value of Common Stock at the
beginning of a 24-month offering period or the end of each six-month segment
within such offering period. The ESPP is
intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section423
of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.
During the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, 488,313 and
344,927 shares were purchased by employees under the terms of the plan
agreements at a weighted average price of $890 and $1052 per share,
respectively. At December31, 2005,
1,574,596 shares were reserved and available for issuance under this plan. The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during
the year ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 as defined by
SFAS123, was $662, $1108, and $1597 per share, respectively. 60 ZORAN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For purposes of the disclosure in Note2 and as required under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, the fair value of each option grant on the

On January 6, 2006, the
Company filed a Tender Offer Statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and commenced an offer to current employees to exchange outstanding
options with exercise prices per share that were more than the greater of
$2000 and the closing sale price of Zoran common stock on the offer expiration
date of February 6, 2006. The exchange offer was approved by Zorans
stockholders at their 2005 annual meeting. On February 6, 2006, the Company
accepted for exchange options to purchase aggregate of 1,060,536 shares of Zoran
common stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of the exchange, the Company
granted 197,433 restricted shares of common stock or restricted stock units in
exchange for the tendered options. The
shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted will vest over
periods of two to four years, depending on the remaining vesting periods of the
options exchanged. None of the directors or executive officers was eligible for
participation in the exchange offer. NOTE11RETIREMENT PLAN We maintain a 401k Plan that covers substantially all of the Companys
US employees. Participants may elect to
contribute a percentage of their compensation to this plan, up to the statutory
maximum amount prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has the ability to make a
discretionary matching contribution to the 401k Plan based on a uniform
percentage of the employees eligible contribution up to a maximum employer
match of $2,000 per year per employee.
Approximately $235,000, $384,000 and $434,000 in matching contributions
were recorded during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. NOTE12EARNINGS

62 ZORAN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued A significant portion of the deferred tax asset above relates to
pre-acquisition loss carryforwards and other attributes along with stock option
benefits that will result in an adjustment to goodwill and paid in capital when
realized. During 2005, the Company realized $12 million related to certain
pre-acquisition tax net operating losses. Realization of these net operating
losses is reported as an adjustment to goodwill in accordance with FAS 109. As of December31, 2005, the Company had NOLs of approximately
$268 million for federal and $85 million for state tax reporting purposes. The federal NOLs expire on various dates
between 2006 and 2025. The state NOLs
expire between 2006 and 2015. As of
December 31, 2005 the Company had tax credits of approximately $19 million for
federal and $11 million for state tax purposes, which will expire beginning in
2006. Management has recorded a full
valuation allowance against all U.S. deferred tax assets on the basis that
significant uncertainty exists regarding the realizeability of the assets. Approximately $18 million of NOLs relate to
stock option deductions, for which a full valuation allowance has been
recorded. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had not accrued income taxes on
$381 million of accumulated undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries
because the earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. The calculation of the Companys tax liabilities involves dealing with
uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The Company records liabilities for
anticipated tax audit issues on its estimate of whether, and the extent to
which, additional taxes may be due. Actual tax liabilities may be different
than the recorded estimates and could result in an additional charge or benefit
to the tax provision in the period when the ultimate tax assessment is
determined. Pursuant to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of and the benefit
from NOLs that can be carried forward may be impaired or limited in certain
circumstances, including a cumulative stock ownership change of more than 50%
over a three-year period. Approximately
$214 million of the federal NOL carryover and $75 million of state NOL
carryover relate to recent acquisitions and are subject to certain limitations
under Internal Revenue Code Section 382. The Companys Israeli subsidiary has been granted the status of an
Approved Enterprise pursuant to the Israeli law for the Encouragement of
Capital Investments, 1959, as amended.
The Company has eight approved programs pursuant to this law. The first program was approved in 1984 and
expired in 1998. The second program was
approved in 1991. Income subject to this
program is exempt from tax for two years from the first year in which the
Company has taxable income net of NOLs and is taxed at a rate of 10% for the
eight years thereafter. Benefits under
the second program expired in 2004. The
third program was approved in 1995.
Income subject to this program is exempt from tax for four years from
the first year in which the Company has taxable income net of NOLs and is taxed
at a rate of 10% during the remaining period of six years. The fourth program was approved in 1997. Income subject to this program is exempt from
tax for two years from the first year in which the Company has taxable income
net of NOLs and is taxed at a rate of 10% during the remaining period of
eight years. The fifth program was
approved in 2000. Income subject to this
program is exempt from tax for two years from the first year in which the
Company has taxable income net of NOLs and is taxed at a rate of 10% during
the remaining period of six years. The
sixth program was approved in 2001.
Income subject to this program is exempt from tax for two years from the
first year in which the Company has taxable income net of NOLs and is taxed
at a rate of 10% during the remaining period of seven years. The seventh program was approved in
2002. Income subject to the seventh
program is exempt from tax for two years from the first year in which the
Company has taxable income net of NOLs and is taxed at a rate of 10% during
the remaining period of eight years. The eighth program was approved in
2004. Income subject to the eighth
program is exempt from tax for two years from the first year in which the
Company has taxable income net of NOLs and is taxed at a rate of 10% during
the remaining period of eight years.
Benefits under the programs are granted for a period of ten years
limited to the early of fourteen years from application; twelve years from
commencement of production. Benefits for the eighth program will expire on
2014. The benefit of these Approved Enterprise programs to the Companys net
loss in 2005 was $57 million. These tax
holidays had no impact to the Companys net loss in 2004 and resulted in a
benefit of $18 million in 2003. NOTE14SEGMENT REPORTING SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for the
reporting by public business enterprises of information about operating
segments, products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The method for determining what information
to report is based on the way that management organizes the operating segments
within the Company for making operational decisions and assessments of
financial performance. The Companys
chief operating decision-maker is considered to be the Chief Executive Officer. Subsequent to the acquisition of Oak
Technology,Inc. in 2003, the Company determined it had four reportable
segments: Digital Versatile Disc DVD, Imaging, Digital Camera DC and
Digital Television DTV. Subsequent to
the Emblaze acquisition in July 2004, the Digital Camera segment was combined
with the Emblaze Mobile business unit and was renamed the Mobile segment. Each segments primary products are based on
highly integrated application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, and system-on-a-chip,
or 63 ZORAN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued SOC, solutions. The DVD and Imaging segments also license
certain software and other intellectual property. The DVD group provides products for use in
DVD players and recordable DVD players.
The Imaging group provides products used in digital copiers, laser and
inkjet printers as well as multifunction peripherals. The Mobile group focuses on solutions for multimedia
mobile phone products and digital camera products. The DTV group provides products for standard
and high definition digital television products including televisions, set top
boxes and personal video recorders. The Company evaluates operating segment
performance based on net revenues and operating expenses of these
segments. The accounting policies of the
operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of accounting
policies. No reportable segments have
been aggregated. Information about reported

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued NOTE
15ACQUISITIONS Oren Semiconductor,Inc. On
June10, 2005, Zoran completed the acquisition of Oren
Semiconductor,Inc. Oren, a privately-held provider of demodulator ICs
for the global high definition television market. Prior to this acquisition, Zoran had made
investments in Oren that represented a 17% ownership interest. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement,
Zoran acquired the remaining 83% of Orens outstanding stock by means of a
merger of Oren with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zoran, in consideration for
which Zoran paid an aggregate of $284million in cash and issued 1,188,061
shares of Zoran common stock valued at $129million, for total
consideration of $413 million, to the other stockholders of Oren and to
employees holding Oren options. The
Company considered the requirements under Accounting
Principles Board Opinions 18 APB 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for
Investments in Common Stock, to retroactively record the gains or losses on
investment of the prior 17% ownership under the equity basis. Based on the Companys analysis, such
adjustments were considered to be immaterial to the prior financial results of
the Company and, accordingly, such adjustments are not reflected in the Companys
previously reported results of operations. The
primary purpose of the acquisition was to obtain Orens demodulator IC technology for the global high
definition television market. The Company intends to combine this
technology with Zorans digital television technology to deliver a complete and
cost-effective system solution for digital television makers. The
transaction was accounted for under SFAS No141, Business Combinations,
using the purchase method of accounting.
The Company incurred approximately $375,000 for acquisition-related
expenses consisting of financial advisory, legal and other consulting services. The Company completed a valuation analysis
and purchase price allocation. The results of operations of Oren have been
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
The acquisition resulted in goodwill of approximately $353million. In
accordance with SFAS142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill
will not be amortized and will be tested for impairment at least annually. The Company does not expect goodwill to be
deductible for tax purposes. Allocation of the
purchase price is as follows in thousands

intangible assets include purchased technology totaling $70 million, trade
name and other intangible assets totaling $125 million and customer base
totaling $850,000 which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives
of five years. Approximately
$27million of the purchase price was allocated to in-process research
and development which had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative future use. Accordingly,
this amount was immediately expensed upon the acquisition date. This amount was determined using managements
estimates including consultation with an independent appraiser. The value of the in-process research and
development was determined using a discounted cash flow method and factors
including projected financial results, relative risk of successful development,
time-value of money and level of completion. Emblaze
Semiconductor Ltd. On July 8, 2004, Zoran acquired Emblaze Semiconductor
Ltd. Emblaze, a subsidiary of
Emblaze Ltd. and a provider of semiconductor-based solutions for high volume
manufacturers of multimedia mobile telephones.
Under the terms of the agreement, Zorans wholly-owned Israel based
subsidiary, Zoran Microelectronics Ltd., acquired all of the outstanding common
shares of Emblaze for approximately $542 million in cash. The
primary purpose of the acquisition was to gain high performance, low-power
application processors, technology and products for the fast growing multimedia
mobile phone market. This technology was
combined with Zorans image processing technology to deliver reliable,
cost-effective system solutions for mobile phone makers. As of December 31, 2005, there have been no
material variations from the underlying assumptions that were used in the
original computation of the value of the acquired entity. 66 ZORAN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued The
transaction was accounted for under SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations,
using the purchase method of accounting.
The Company incurred approximately $180,000 for acquisition-related
expenses consisting of financial advisory, legal and other consulting
services. The Company completed a
valuation analysis and purchase price allocation with the assistance of a third
party appraiser. The results of
operations of Emblaze have been included in the consolidated financial
statements from the date of acquisition.
The acquisition resulted in goodwill of approximately
$309million. In accordance with
SFAS142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill will not be
amortized and will be tested for impairment at least annually. The Company does not expect goodwill to be
deductible for tax purposes. Allocation of the purchase price is as follows in

August11, 2003, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated
as of May4, 2003 the Merger Agreement among Zoran, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Zoran Merger Sub, and Oak Technology,Inc., Oak was
merged with and into Merger Sub. The
transaction was accounted for under SFAS No.
141, Business Combinations, using the purchase method of accounting
and accordingly the results of operations of Oak have been included in the
Companys financial statements since the date of acquisition. The
Companys primary objectives in acquiring Oak were based on the Companys
belief that the combined company would benefit from the following Oaks complementary technologies and
products, especially in the digital TV and digital imaging markets, and the
ability of the combined company to expand its existing customer base and market
share in the digital consumer electronics market by integrating the product
lines of each company Oaks intellectual property portfolio and
related expertise, especially intellectual property relating to front-end
optical recording access to Oaks customer relationships,
providing cross-selling opportunities to existing customers as well as
opportunities to build new relationships the opportunity to achieve synergies and
realize significant cost savings, including operational efficiencies, such as
acceleration of various product development activities by leveraging Oaks
intellectual property, reduced overhead and, in geographic areas where the two
companies overlap, increased efficiency in the combined companys sales
channels Oaks existing market position as a leading
supplier of HDTV integrated circuits, providing the combined company with
access to this high-growth market segment; and Oaks existing market position as a leading
supplier of Digital Imaging related integrated circuit and software products. The
purchase price exceeded the net assets acquired resulting in the recognition of
goodwill and other intangible assets. 67 ZORAN CORPORATION

The
cash payment and fair value of common stock issued represents the conversion of
each outstanding share of Oak common stock into $178 in cash and 02323 of a
share of Zoran common stock. As a result
of the acquisition, 56,737,298 shares of Oak common stock were converted into
$1010million in cash and 13,180,074 shares of Zoran common stock with a
fair value of $2275million based on the fair market value of Zoran
common stock for the period two days before and after the date on which the
terms of agreement were finalized and announced, May5, 2003. Non-qualified
options to purchase approximately 45million shares of Zoran common stock
with a term of ten years were granted to Oak employees as part of the
acquisition. The corresponding fair
value of these options of $574million was estimated based on the fair
value of the Zoran common stock as of the acquisition date using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model applying the following assumptions: expected life of
50months, risk-free interest rate of 365%, expected volatility of 93%
and no expected dividend yield. The
intrinsic value of the unvested options, totaling approximately
$192million, has been recorded as deferred stock compensation is being
amortized over the vesting period using the multiple option approach. Acquisition
costs included $33million of investment banker fees, $17million
of insurance costs, $11million of legal and accounting fees and $700,000
in other acquisition related expenses. The purchase price allocation was as follows

Tangible
assets were valued at estimates of their current fair values. The valuation of the acquired intangible
assets, which was based on managements estimates and considered various
factors including appraisals, resulted in a value of purchased technology of
approximately $1579million, patents of $270million, customer base
of $115million and trademarks and tradenames of approximately
$13million. Purchased technology
is being amortized over a weighted average estimated useful life of
48years, and patents, customer base, trademarks and tradenames are being
amortized over their estimated useful lives of fiveyears with no residual
values. During
the period August11, 2003 through March 31, 2004, management revised its
estimates related to certain assets and liabilities, and as a result, the
purchase price and goodwill were each decreased by $34 million. In 2005,
goodwill was reduced by $12 million due to tax adjustments associated with the
Oak acquisition. 68 ZORAN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Approximately
$600million of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable
intangible assets acquired. In
accordance with SFAS142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill
will not be amortized and will be tested for impairment at least annually. The Company does not expect goodwill to be
deductible for tax purposes. Approximately
$501million of the purchase price was allocated to in-process research and
development which had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative future use. Accordingly,
this amount was immediately expensed upon the acquisition date. This amount was determined using managements
estimates including consultation with an independent appraiser. The value of the in-process research and
development was determined using a discounted cash flow method and factors
including projected financial results, relative risk of successful development,
time-value of money and level of completion. At
the time of acquisition, Oak had five material development projects in process
as follows Quatro 4100a highly integrated, fully programmable system-on-a-chip SOC
solution for the emerging class of appliance type printers. The Quatro-4100 incorporates the RISC CPU core
and Quatro SIMD DSP core to provide an easy to program controller platform. Quatro 4230a programmable SOC solution that will complement the Quatro-4110
and Quatro-4100 in the inkjet market.
Quatro 4230 will provide a fully scalable solution platform to cover
much of the performance and feature range of an OEMs laser offerings. Integrated Print SystemThe Integrated Print System IPS is a dynamic embedded scalable
architecture providing peripheral manufacturers with highly integrated modular
controller and connectivity software for powering single and multifunctional
devices. Generation 9an integrated SOC that integrates a previous generation of HDTV
digital video technology with a new Audio-DSP Core as well as a MIPS 64 bit
processor and certain other video processing features. A new lower cost highly integrated HDTV
decoderthe first in a family of highly integrated HDTV decoders specifically
designed for the FCC mandated digital television chassis market. This device includes all the required
interfacing to support digital cable applications and is applicable to existing
CRT and flat panel display devices. The
value of in-process research and development was determined using the multi-period
excess earnings method by estimating the expected net cash flows from the
projects once commercially viable and discounting the net cash flows back to
their present value using a discount rate of 22%. This rate was based on the industry segment
for the technology, nature of the products to be developed, length of time to
complete the project and overall maturity and history of the development
team. The net cash flows from the
identified projects were based on estimates of revenue, cost of revenue, research
and development expenses, selling general and administrative expenses, and
applicable income taxes. These estimates
did not take into account any potential synergies that could be realized as a
result of the acquisition. Revenues for
the incremental core technologies commenced in 2005 and are expected to extend
through 2011. Revenue projections were
based on estimates of market size and growth, expected trends in technology and
the expected timing of new product introductions. As of December 31, 2005, there have been no
material variations from the underlying assumptions that were used in the
original computation of the value of the acquired in-process research and
development. 69 ZORAN CORPORATION

Note2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Restatement
of Financial Results for Quarters Ended March 31, June 30 and September 30,
2004 The selected quarterly
financial information above reflects the restatement of the quarters ended
March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004 to correct an error in the
calculation of deferred stock compensation expense. Following the acquisition of Oak, the Company
failed to update its personnel and financial records to reflect the forfeiture
of unvested options held by former Oak employees that occurred when the
employment of any such employee terminated prior to vesting. As a result, the Company improperly
recognized deferred stock compensation expenses relating to options that had
been held by former Oak employees after the vesting of such options had ceased
due to termination of employment and did not reverse stock based compensation
expense previously recognized for unvested awards that were forfeited. For the quarters ended March 31, 2004, June
30, 2004 and September 30, 2004, the previously recorded deferred stock
compensation expense was reduced by $704,000, $1,545,000 and $880,000,
respectively, as a result of the restatement. The financial information included
on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K reports previously filed or furnished by Zoran for
these periods should not be relied upon and are superceded by the following
information. The following table shows

Item 5ontrols and Procedures Conclusion
Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule13a-15e
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange
Act. Based on our evaluation, our principal executive officer and our
principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual
report. Managements
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by,
or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, and effected by our board of directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP,
and includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in
reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of Zoran 2 provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and
directors; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework
in Internal Control Integrated Framework,
our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2005. Our managements assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which
is included herein. Changes to
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the
quarter ended December31, 2005 that have materially affected or
are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial
reporting. Item 9B
