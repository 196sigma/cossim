Young Innovations, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Young Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the financial statement schedule. We also have audited Young Innovations internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Young Innovations management is responsible for these financial statements, the financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements, the financial statement schedule and an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Young Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also in our opinion, Young Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSO.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The management of Young Innovations, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that       
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; 
provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 
Internal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and testing, and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility that controls can be circumvented or overridden, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Further, conditions in our business change over time, and, therefore, internal control effectiveness may vary over time.
The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Managements assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Based on this assessment and the foregoing criteria, management believes that, as of December 31, 2008, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008 has been audited by Crowe HorwathLLP, an independent registered
accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item8 of this Report.

YOUNG INNOVATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2008
in thousands, except per share data
1. ORGANIZATION    
Young Innovations, Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company develops, manufactures and markets supplies and equipment used by dentists, dental hygienists, dental assistants and consumers. The Company product offering includes disposable and metal prophylaxis prophy angles, prophy cups and brushes, dental micro-applicators, panoramic X-ray machines, moisture control products, infection control products, dental handpieces drills and related components, endodontic systems, orthodontic toothbrushes, flavored examination gloves, children toothbrushes, and children toothpastes.
The Companys manufacturing and distribution facilities are located in Missouri, Illinois, California, Indiana, Texas, Wisconsin and Ireland. Export sales were approximately 18% and 16% of total net sales for 2008 and 2007, respectively and less than 10% in 2006. Sales denominated in Euros and Canadian dollars approximated 6% and 1%, respectively of total sales in 2008. 
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Young Innovations, Inc. and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of the more significant estimates include allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation reserves, rebate accruals, warranty reserves, liabilities for potential incentive compensation and uncertain income tax positions.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost which includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead or net realizable value. Inventory values are based upon standard costs which approximate actual costs, determined by the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, and additions and improvements that significantly extend the lives of assets are capitalized. Upon disposition, cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the related accounts, and any gain or loss is reflected in the statements of income. The Company provides depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of respective classes of assets as follows       
Buildings and improvements 
3 to 40 years 
Machinery and equipment 
3 to 10 years 
Equipment rented to others 
4 to 15 years 
34
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination are not amortized, but are instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142. SFAS 142 also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks, license agreements, core technology, patents and patent applications, product formulas, and supplier and customer relationships. Trademarks have been
determined to have indefinite useful lives, and therefore the carrying value is reviewed at least annually for recoverability in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 142. Other intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally between 5 and 40 years, and tested for impairment whenever conditions indicate that an asset may be impaired. 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company assesses and measures any impairments of long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite life intangibles in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144. If facts and circumstances suggest that a long-lived asset may be impaired, the carrying value is reviewed. If this review indicates that the carrying value of the asset will not be recovered, as determined based on projected undiscounted cash flows related to the asset over its remaining life, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value. The Company has not incurred any material impairments of long-lived assets during 2008, 2007 and 2006. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable and debt. The estimated fair value of these instruments approximates their carrying value. Due to the short term nature of the notes receivable, book value approximates fair value.
Shipping and Handling
Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from the sale of products is recorded at the time title passes, generally when the products are shipped, as the Companys shipping terms are customarily FOB shipping point. Revenue from the rental of equipment to others is recognized on a month-to-month basis as the revenue is earned. The Company generally requires payment within 30 days from the date of invoice and offers cash discounts for early payment. For certain acquired businesses that offer different terms, the Company migrates these customers to the terms referred above within a 2-5 year period. 
The Company offers discounts to its distributors if certain conditions are met. Customer allowances, volume discounts and rebates, and other short-term incentive programs are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale. The Company reduces product revenue for the estimated redemption of annual rebates on certain current product sales. Customer allowances and rebates are estimated based on historical experience and known trends. 
The policy with respect to sales returns generally provides that a customer may not return inventory except at the Companys option, with the exception of X-ray machines, which have a 90-day return policy. Historically, the level of product returns has not been significant. The Company generally warrants its products against defects, and its most generous policy provides a two-year parts and labor warranty on X-ray machines. The Company owns X-ray equipment rented on a month-to-month basis to customers. A liability for the removal costs of the rented X-ray machines is capitalized and amortized over four years. 
In 2006, the Company adopted the disclosure requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force the EITF Issue No06-3, 
35
How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should be Presented in the Income Statement that is, gross versus net presentation for tax receipts on the face of their income statements. The scope of this guidance includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes gross receipts taxes are excluded. The Company has historically presented such taxes on a net basis.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed when incurred. Advertising costs were approximately $2,857, $2,820, and $2,390 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs are expensed when incurred and totaled $796, $738, and $915 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
Interest Expense, net
Interest expense, net includes interest paid related to borrowings on the Companys credit facility, as well as interest income earned on various investments and notes receivable. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, interest income totaled $367, $407 and $633, respectively, and interest expense totaled $1,699, $1,516 and $661, respectively. 
Other Income Expense, net
Other income expense, net includes foreign currency transaction gain/loss and other miscellaneous income, all of which are not directly related to the Companys primary business. 
Income Taxes
The Company has accounted for income taxes under SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach to accounting for and reporting income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities using rates which are expected to apply in the period the differences are estimated to reverse.
The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of SFAS No. 109 on January 1, 2007 with no material impact to the financial statements. FIN48 requires the Company to maintain a liability for underpayment of income taxes and related interest and penalties, if any, for uncertain income tax positions. In considering the need for and magnitude of a liability for uncertain income tax positions, the Company must make certain estimates and assumptions regarding the amount of income tax benefit that will ultimately be realized. The ultimate resolution of an uncertain tax position may not be known for a number of years, during which time the Company may be required to adjust these provisions, in light of changing facts and circumstances.  
Share-Based Compensation 
Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R. The Company elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by SFAS No. 123R; accordingly, results from prior periods have not been restated. Under this transition method, compensation cost must be recognized in the financial statements for all awards granted after the date of adoption as well as for existing stock awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of the date of adoption.  Under the provisions of SFAS 123R, share-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the awards fair-value as calculated by an option pricing model, and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period. The option pricing models require judgmental assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected option life. If any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly,
share-based compensation expense may differ in the future from that recorded in the current period.
Foreign Currency Translation
The translation of financial statements into U.S dollars has been performed in accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign 
36
Currency Translation. The local currency for all entities included in the consolidated financial statements has been designated as the functional currency. Non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities have been translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses have been translated at the weighted average of exchange rates in effect during the year. Translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated comprehensive loss income. Net currency transaction gains losses included in other income expense, net were $434, $99 and $25 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Segment Information
The Company operates as a single reportable operating segment. While management monitors the revenue streams of various products, the identifiable segments' operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a company-wide basis. Accordingly, all of the Companys products are considered by management to be aggregated in one reportable operating segment.
Supplemental Cash Flow Information
Cash flows from operating activities include $4,375, $5,196, and $7,464 for the payment of federal and state income taxes and $1,846, $1,539 and $552 for the payment of interest related to borrowings on the Companys credit facility during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

ACQUISITIONS:  
On July 31, 2006, the Company entered into an agreement, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Young Microbrush, LLC and Young Microbrush Ireland Ltd., with Microbrush, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation, and Microbrush International Ltd., a Republic of Ireland private limited company, collectively, Microbrush, to acquire substantially all of Microbrushs assets related to the manufacture, development and distribution of dental products. The acquisition of U.S. purchased assets was completed on July 31, 2006. The acquisition of Irish purchased assets was completed on August 18, 2006. The Company paid approximately $32,777 in cash, including direct transaction costs, in connection with the acquisition. Of the purchase price, $3,000 was paid into an escrow account pending settlement of any indemnification claims. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, the escrow was released on January 31, 2008 in full to the
sellers. An additional $2,735 in purchase price was paid by the Company Earnout Payment on May 13, 2008 for certain performance targets achieved. The acquisition further establishes the Company as a leader in the category of consumable dental products, enabling the Company to expand its product offerings in this area.
The acquisition was financed through a combination of cash generated from operations as well as debt, and was accounted for as a business combination. Debt incurred to finance the acquisition totaled $20,060. Upon initial allocation of the purchase price at the time of the acquisition, goodwill was determined to be $23,737. The finalization of the Microbrush purchase price allocation resulted in a $2,086 net increase to goodwill consisting of an increase of $2,735 related to the settlement of the Earnout Payment, an increase of $82 related to adjustments to the fair value of estimates of assets, an increase of $192 related to revised estimates of fees accrued related to the acquisition, a decrease of $578 related to revised estimates for intangible assets and a decrease of $345 related to restructuring accruals.

During the first quarter of 2006, YI Ventures LLC acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed a portion of the liabilities of DN Microproducts, Inc., a contract manufacturer of the Companys diagnostic product line. The Company paid approximately $2,800 in cash, including transaction costs. Upon initial allocation of the purchase price at the time of the acquisition, goodwill was determined to be $1,582 and $269 of supplier relationships was recognized. The finalization of the DN Microproducts, Inc. purchase price allocation resulted in a $17 net increase to goodwill from amounts recorded at December 31, 2006, which was primarily related to changes in estimates related to severance liabilities and adjustments to the fair value estimates of the assets and liabilities. The results of operations for DN Microproducts, Inc. are included in the consolidated financial statements since January 2006.

NOTES RECEIVABLE: 
The Company offers various financing options to its equipment customers, which includes notes payable to the Company. The equipment was used to secure the notes. Total revenue from sales of equipment financed by the Company was $45, $2,324 and $5,118 during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These transactions are recorded as a sale upon the transfer of title to the purchaser, which generally occurs at the time of shipment, at an amount equal to the sales price of non-financed sales. Interest on these notes is accrued as earned and recorded as interest income.
On January 16, 2008, the Company transferred a majority of its X-ray equipment loans to a third party for a cash payment of $3,519. The Company transferred $4,154 of the notes receivable portfolio for a purchase price of $4,140. Of the purchase price, $621 is subject to a recourse holdback pool that has been established with respect to the limited recourse the third party has on the loans. On May 5, 2008, the Company transferred additional X-ray equipment loans to a third party for a cash payment of $235. There is an additional $42 subject to a recourse holdback pool. As the transactions do not qualify as sales of assets under SFAS 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities, the transactions have been treated as financing and the loans remain on the Companys balance sheet. As the third party receives payments on the transferred notes, the
Company reduces the corresponding notes receivable and secured borrowing balances. As of December 31, 2008, the residual amount of notes receivable transferred to a third party was $2,815, of which $1,126 is classified as a short-term notes receivable and $1,689 as a long-term notes receivable. A corresponding long-term and short-term liability have been recorded, net of the recourse holdback pool of $663, on the Companys balance sheet.

14. SHARE BASED COMPENSATION    
The Company adopted the 1997 Stock Option Plan the 1997 Plan effective in November 1997 and amended the Plan in 1999 and 2001. A total of 1,725 shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance under this plan which is administered by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors Compensation Committee. The Company adopted the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2006 Plan effective in May 2006. The 2006 Plan is intended to be a successor to the 1997 
42
Plan. A total of 700 shares were authorized for grant under the 2006 Plan. Awards under the 2006 Plan may be stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and other equity awards. 
Any employee of the Company or its affiliates, any consultant whom the Compensation Committee determines is significantly responsible for the Companys success and future growth and profitability, and any member of the Board of Directors, may be eligible to receive awards under the 2006 Plan. The purpose of the 2006 Plan is to: a attract and retain highly competent persons as employees, directors, and consultants of the Company; b provide additional incentives to such employees, directors, and consultants by aligning their interests with those of the Companys shareholders; and c promote the success of the business of the Company. The Compensation Committee establishes vesting schedules for each option issued under the Plan. Under the 1997 Plan, outstanding options generally vested over a period of up to four years while non-vested equity shares vested over five years. Under the 2006 Plan, outstanding
options generally vest over a period of up to three years while non-vested equity shares vest over one, two, three, four and five year periods. All outstanding options expire ten years from the date of grant under the 1997 Plan and five years from the date of grant under the 2006 Plan.
As of January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, which requires recognition of expense related to the fair value of stock-based compensation awards. The Company elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by SFAS No. 123R; accordingly, results from prior periods have not been restated. Under this transition method, compensation cost must be recognized in the financial statements for all awards granted after the date of adoption as well as for existing stock awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of the date of adoption.  Under the provisions of SFAS 123R, share-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the awards fair-value as calculated by an option pricing model, and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period. The option pricing models require judgmental assumptions including
volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected option life. If any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly, share-based compensation expense may differ in the future from that recorded in the current period.
Stock Options
During the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded pre-tax compensation expense of $241 and $168 related to the Companys stock option shares. As of December 31, 2008, there was approximately $335 of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options, which will be recognized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service period of 15 years. The total aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised was $378, $398, and $2,730 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Payments received upon the exercise of stock options were $443, $283, and $1,176 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The related tax shortfall benefit realized related to these exercises was $24, $113 and $1,070 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The Company issues shares from treasury upon share option exercises.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average estimated value of stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $527 and $710 per share, respectively, using the following weighted-average assumptions

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value the difference between the Companys closing stock price on the last trading day of the year ended December 31, 2008 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options. 
Non-Vested Equity Shares
Under the 2006 Plan, non-vested equity share units and restricted stock may be awarded or sold to participants under terms and conditions established by the Compensation Committee. The Company calculates compensation cost for restricted stock grants to employees and non-employee directors by using the fair market value of its Common Stock at the date of grant and the number of shares issued. This compensation cost is amortized over the applicable vesting period. During the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded pre-tax compensation expense of $1,201, $903 and $294, respectively, related to the Companys non-vested equity shares. As of December 31, 2008, there was approximately $2,619 of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested equity shares which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service period of 25 years. The Company issues share grants from treasury.

The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. With certain exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2005. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of SFAS No. 109 on January 1, 2007 with no material impact to the financial statements. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows

$101  
If recognized in future periods, $101 of the total unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2008 would favorably affect the effective income tax rate. The Company is not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. 
The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Tax expense for the current year ended December 31, 2008 includes $7 of penalties and interest. The total amount of interest and penalties recognized related to uncertain tax provisions at December 31, 2008 was approximately $26.

Current deferred income tax assets of $2,235 and $1,708 are included in other current assets as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $100 and $2,400 of undistributed earnings of the Company foreign subsidiary for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These earnings are considered to be permanently invested and, under certain tax laws, are not subject to taxes unless distributed as dividends, loaned to the Company or a U.S. affiliate, or if the Company sold its investment in the foreign subsidiary. Tax on such potential distributions would be partially offset by foreign tax credits. If the earning were not considered permanently invested, approximately $29 and $520 of deferred income taxes would need to be provided for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
16. SALES OF EQUIPMENT RENTED TO OTHERS    
Periodically, customers who rent X-ray equipment from the Company elect to purchase the equipment. The Company recognizes revenue for the proceeds of such sales and records as cost of goods sold the net book value of the equipment. Net sales of equipment consistent with this practice were $1,600, $1,512, and $1,452 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and gross profit from these sales was $868, $782 and $716 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
17. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS    
The Company has defined contribution 401k plans covering substantially all full-time employees meeting service and age requirements. Contributions to the Plan can be made by an employee through deferred compensation and through a discretionary employer contribution. Compensation expense related to this plan was $553, $476, and $406, for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company also offers certain healthcare insurance benefits for substantially all employees.
18. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS    
The Company paid consulting fees of $50 each year in 2008, 2007 and 2006, to a corporation which is wholly owned by George E. Richmond, the Companys Vice Chairman. 
The Company has an employment agreement with George E. Richmond, the Companys Vice Chairman, which paid him $50 each year in 2008, 2007 and 2006, to perform such duties as may be assigned to him by the Companys Board or Chief Executive Officer.
The Company paid fees of $0, $85 and $89, in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, to a corporation which is wholly owned 
46
by George E. Richmond, the Companys Vice Chairman, for corporate use of an aircraft owned by that corporation.
In August 2007, the Company purchased 1,000 shares of its Common Stock from trusts controlled by George E. Richmond, the Companys Vice Chairman and principal stockholder, for an aggregate purchase price of $26,000.
19.  
EARNINGS PER SHARE: 
Basic earnings per share Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share Diluted EPS includes the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock, if any, using the treasury stock method.

21. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    
The Company leases certain office and warehouse space, manufacturing facilities, automobiles, and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. The total rental expense for all operating leases was $780, $893, and $951 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Rental commitments amount to: $440 for 2009, $434 for 2010, $435 for 2011, $225 for 2012, and $0 for 2013. 
In certain circumstances, the Company provides recourse for loans for equipment purchases by customers. Certain banks require the Company to provide recourse to finance equipment for new dentists and other customers with credit histories which are not consistent with the banks' lending criteria. In the event that a bank requires recourse on a given loan, the Company would assume the banks security interest in the equipment securing the loan. As of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, approximately $788, $75 and $20 of the equipment financed with various lenders were subject to 
47
such recourse. Recourse on a given loan is generally for the life of the loan. Based on the Companys past experience with respect to these arrangements, it is the opinion of management that the fair value of the recourse provided is minimal and not material to the results of operations or financial position of the Company. 
The Company and its subsidiaries from time to time are parties to various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Management believes that none of these proceedings, if determined adversely, would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
The policy with respect to sales returns generally provides that a customer may not return inventory except at the Companys option, with the exception of X-ray machines, which have a 90-day return policy. Historically, the level of product returns has not been significant. The Company generally warrants its products against defects, and its most generous policy provides a two-year parts and labor warranty on X-ray machines. The accrual for warranty costs was $309 and $317 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The following is a rollforward of the Companys warranty accrual

On February 12, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors issued 1005 shares of restricted stock to certain employees.

23. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS    
In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets FSP 142-3. FSP 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FSP 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its financial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. SFAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of SFAS 157 for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually. In accordance with this staff position, the Company has only adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 with respect to its financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value within the financial statements as of January 1, 2008. The provisions of SFAS 157 have not been applied to non-financial
assets and non-financial liabilities. The major categories of assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, for which the Company has not applied the provisions of SFAS 157, are as follows: reporting units measured at fair value in the first step of a goodwill impairment under SFAS 142, long-lived assets, including intangible assets measured at fair value for an impairment assessment under SFAS 144.
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo141 revised 2007, Business Combinations SFASNo141R. Under SFASNo141R, an entity is required to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date. It further requires that acquisition-related costs be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred, restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date, and changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period impact income tax expense. The
changes related to income taxes also impact the accounting for acquisitions completed prior to the effective date of SFAS 141R.
In addition, acquired in-process research and development is capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over its estimated useful life. The adoption of SFASNo141R will change the
accounting treatment for business combinations, generally on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of 2009. The Company expects SFAS141R will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements when effective, but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature, terms and size of the acquisitions the Company consummates after the effective date.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company adopted SFAS 159 as of the beginning of its 2008 fiscal year and the adoption did not impact the Companys financial statements, since it did not elect to measure any financial instruments at fair value.
On December11, 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS140-4 and FASB Interpretation FIN 46R-8, Disclosures about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities FSP FAS140-4 and FIN46R-8. This FSP requires additional disclosures by public entities with continuing involvement in transfers of financial assets to special purpose entities and with variable interests in VIEs. FSP FAS140-4 and FIN46R-8 was effective for reporting periods ending after December15, 2008. The adoption of FSP FAS140-4 and FASB Interpretation FIN 46R-8 did not impact the Companys financial statements or disclosures.
