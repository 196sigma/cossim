ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Board of Directors
Bigmar, Inc.
Columbus, Ohio
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bigmar,
Inc. and subsidiaries as at December 31, 1996 and December 31, 1995 and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
1996. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements enumerated above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Bigmar, Inc.
and subsidiaries, as at December 31, 1996 and December 31, 1995, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note A to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company anticipates that it will require
additional financing in order to complete the validation of its plant and
equipment and to fund its operations prior to its plant becoming fully
operational. This factor raises substantial doubt about the Company ability to
continue as a going concern. Management plans with regard to this matter are
also discussed in Note A. The consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE A - The Company     [1] Business and recent transactions        Bigmar, Inc. the Company was formed in September 1995 by
Chemholding SA, Chemholding principal stockholders and John G. Tramontana for
the purpose of manufacturing and distributing various oncological and
biotechnical products including six oncological products, the distribution
rights to which were acquired from affiliates of Chemholding SA. A
dispute between the Company and the affiliates Note C, was settled effective
March 27, 1997 and the licensing and distribution agreements with the affiliates
were cancelled. The Company has identified other sources for certain of the raw
materials required for the products that the Company intends to manufacture in
its newly built facility.
Certain stockholders of the Company owned 100% of Bigmar Pharmaceuticals
SA Pharmaceuticals and 50% of Bioren SA Bioren, two Swiss corporations.
The other 50% of Bioren is owned by Pharmaceuticals. On April 9, 1996 the
Company acquired 100% of Pharmaceuticals and 50% of Bioren in a stock for stock
exchange. Since there was a high degree of common ownership, the acquisition was
accounted for as a reorganization of companies under common control.
Accordingly, the financial statements of the Company have been restated to
include the results of operations of Pharmaceuticals for all periods presented
and the results of Bioren from July 1, 1995, the date that Pharmaceuticals and
certain stockholders of the Company acquired their interests.
Pharmaceuticals is currently engaged in the distribution in various
countries in Europe of oncological products, a substantial portion of which were
purchased from the Chemholding affiliates. Bioren is primarily a manufacturer
and distributor of intravenous infusion solutions in Switzerland. In addition,
the Company intends to become a manufacturer and a distributor of pharmaceutical
products.
In April, 1996 the stockholders of the Company contributed 99% of their
shares to the Company. Also in April 1996 the Company restated and amended its
certificate of incorporation, increasing its authorized shares of common stock
from 10,000,000 to 15,000,000, authorizing 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
and effecting a 2105263 for one reverse stock split. These transactions are
reflected retroactively in the accompanying financial statements. In June 1996
the Company closed on an initial public offering of its common stock.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE A - The Company: continued
[2] Basis of presentation        The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has utilized a
significant portion of the proceeds of its recent initial public offering in the
construction of its property, plant and equipment and in the process of
designing and testing the plant and equipment in order to obtain approval by the
Intercantonal Office for the Control of Medications IKS in Switzerland and
by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the manufacture of
pharmaceutical products validation. Although the Company obtained a
provisional approval to manufacture product from the IKS in February 1997, the
Company anticipates that it will require additional financing in order to
complete the validation process and to fund its operations prior to the plant
becoming fully operational. Also, there is no assurance that the Company will be
able to manufacture its proposed products successfully or that such products
will be accepted by the Company targeted customers. In addition, as discussed
in Note C, the Company has terminated agreements with a related party which was
a source of raw materials which generated approximately $833,000 in revenue in
1996. Management currently anticipates that its cash resources will be depleted
by July 1997 and that its operations will not begin to generate sufficient cash
to fund its expansion and planned research and development activities by such
time. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company ability to
continue as a going concern. Management is discussing additional financing with
financial institutions, however, there is no assurance that such financing will
be available on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. No adjustments have
been made to reflect the recoverability or classification of recorded assets
amounts or the classification of liabilities should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern.
NOTE B - Significant Accounting Policies     [1]  Consolidation        The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Bigmar, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Pharmaceuticals, Bioren and
Bigmar Therapeutics, Inc. Therapeutics, a Delaware corporation formed in
September 1995 to enter into a partnership agreement see Note L. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the
consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE B - Significant Accounting Policies: continued
[2]  Use of Estimates        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
[3]  Fair Value of Financial Instruments        The carrying value of cash, trade receivables and trade payables
approximates the fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.
For long-term debt, the carrying value approximates the fair
value because no major changes have occurred in the applicable interest rates.
[4] Cash equivalents        All highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three
months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.
[5]  Inventory        Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market using the
first-in, first-out FIFO method.
[6]  Property, plant and equipment        Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and
repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation is calculated on a
straight-line basis utilizing the assets' estimated useful lives of 3 to 25
years.
[7]  Organization expenses        Costs associated with the organization of the Company are
capitalized and amortized over five years.
[8]  Goodwill        Goodwill is amortized over a ten year period. The Company intends
to evaluate the continuing value of goodwill based on undiscounted cash flows.

NOTE B - Significant Accounting Policies: continued
[9]  Income taxes        Income taxes are accounted for by the asset/liability approach.
Deferred taxes arise from differences between the financial reporting and tax
bases of assets and liabilities.
[10]  Foreign Currency Transactions        Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions and
changes in foreign currency positions are included in income or expense
currently. Such amounts were insignificant in 1995 and 1994.
[11]  Foreign Currency Translation        The Company operations are located in Switzerland and its net
assets, revenues and expenses are substantially all denominated in Swiss francs,
while the Company presents its consolidated financial statements in US dollars.
Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the
balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average
exchange rates for the period. Net gains and losses arising upon translation of
local currency financial statements to US dollars are accumulated in a separate
component of stockholders' equity, the cumulative translation adjustment
account, which may be realized upon the eventual disposition by the Company of
part or all of its investments in its Swiss operations.
[12]  Per share data        Net income loss per share is based on the weighted average
number of shares outstanding during each period after giving retroactive effect
to the reorganization, the capital contribution and the reverse stock split, all
described in Note A.
[13] Long-lived assets        In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed of, the Company records impairment losses on long-lived
assets used in operations, including intangible assets, when events and
circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted
cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying
amounts of those assets. No such losses have been recorded through December 31,
1996.

[14] Stock-based compensation        During 1996, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS
No. 123. The provisions of SFAS No. 123 allow companies to either expense the
estimated fair value of stock options or to continue to follow the intrinsic
value method set forth in Accounting Principles Bulletin Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB No. 25 but disclose the pro

for its stock option incentive plans see Note O.
NOTE C - Related Party Dispute     In the second half of 1996, Cerbios-Phama SA Cerbios, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Chemholding SA, a beneficial owner of
approximately 254% of the Company common stock, rendered invoices to the
Company, in the amount of approximately $681,000 for expenses and fees to which
Cerbios claimed to be entitled in connection with services it provided to the
Company in 1996. In December 1996, Cerbios submitted a letter to the Company
requesting reimbursement of approximately $1,118,000 to which Cerbios claimed to
be entitled in connection with services it provided to the Company in 1995. In
March 1997, Cerbios claimed that it was owed an additional $2,243,000 for
various services and values of lost contracts.
The Company maintains that no substantial services were provided in
1995 by Cerbios to the Company and that the amounts claimed for 1996 by Cerbios
far exceeded the actual expenses incurred by Cerbios on behalf of the Company.
The actual expenses were accrued in the Company 1996 quarterly financial
statements. On March 27, 1997, the Company reached a settlement with Cerbios of
the claims for approximately $300,000 and in connection therewith Cerbios
delivered to the Company a release.
Pursuant to the settlement, the Company and each of its wholly-owned
subsidiaries and Cerbios have mutually agreed to the cancellation of the
following agreements: the Sapec Exclusive Distribution Agreement the Sapec
Agreement, the Bioferment Exclusive Distribution and Supply Agreement the
Bioferment Agreement, and the Bioferment License and Supply Agreement the
Bioferment License Agreement. In addition, the Company has determined to
terminate all relationships and transactions with

Cerbios entities, including the purchase of raw materials for resale, which
purchases aggregated approximately $501,000 and generated sales of approximately
$833,000 in 1996.
The Sapec Agreement provided for, among other things, the supply of
Sodium Leucovorin and five generic oncological products. The Company has not
obtained another supplier for Sodium Leucovorin. The Company has identified
alternative suppliers for the five generic oncological products and has already
obtained two of the generic oncological products from other suppliers. The
Company believes it can acquire the other three products from alternative
suppliers. The Company has paid Sapec a one-time fee of $100,000 for the grant
of the exclusive rights and licenses that were part of the Sapec Agreement. This
fee has been forfeited and no refund will be granted.
The Bioferment Agreement provided exclusive worldwide rights to use,
manufacture and market recombinant urokinase Urokinase, a biotechnological
product. The Company has not obtained another supplier for Urokinase. Pursuant
to the Bioferment Agreement, the Company has paid Bioferment a fee of $100,000.
This fee has been forfeited and no refund will be granted. The Company will
attempt to locate an alternative supplier of Urokinase. However, there is no
guarantee the Company will be successful in finding another supplier for
Urokinase. The Bioferment License Agreement provided the license to use,

NOTE J - Legal Reserve     The Swiss Federal Code of Obligation provides that at least 5% of a

such time as this reserve equals 20% of the company share capital. In
addition, 10% of any distribution in excess of a 5% dividend also must be
appropriated to the legal reserve. The legal reserve of up to 5% of the share
capital is not available for distribution.
NOTE K - Income Taxes     Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are provided for temporary
differences between financial statement amounts and the amounts currently
taxable in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Deferred tax assets
are provided for operating loss carryforwards of Bioren which can only be
utilized to offset future taxable income, if any, of Bioren for up to six years
after incurring the losses, depending on the applicable tax legislation and
federal net operating loss carryforwards of Bigmar, Inc. The deferred tax asset

The tax charge in Switzerland is an accumulation of the taxes due to the
city, the canton state and the federal authorities. Therefore, the tax burden
varies from one entity to another depending upon its location. While the actual
tax rate is a function of the percentage of profitability in relation to taxable
equity, the Company believes that 20% and 30% are fair approximations of the
effective cumulative tax rates for Pharmaceuticals and Bioren, respectively. In
addition, as Swiss tax laws do not permit consolidated tax filings, possible tax
losses in one entity do not offset taxable income in another.
On January 1, 1995, a new federal tax law, and for most Swiss cantons, a
new cantonal tax law, came into force in Switzerland. The new laws provide for a
change in the system of assessment from a two-year past assessment period to a
one-year current assessment period. Because these changes may create a gap
during which certain profits made in prior years may not be taxed or may be only
partially taxed, the new laws have provided for a transition period during which
a special method is followed to calculate income taxes. Since the 1995 taxes due
based on the old methods of assessment had been fully accrued for during 1993
and 1994, the 1995 tax charge only relates to the adjustment needed based on the
1995 income. A reconciliation between the actual income tax expense and income
taxes computed by applying the United States federal income tax rate of 34% to
earnings before taxes is as follows                                   Year Ended December 31,

NOTE L - Collaborative Agreements With Related Parties     [1] The Cernelle Agreement        On November 5, 1995 Pharmaceuticals entered into an exclusive
distribution and supply agreement Cernelle Agreement with AB Cernelle, a
Swedish corporation formerly owned by a principal stockholder of Bigmar
Cernelle. The Company Chief Executive Officer is a director of Cernelle.
The Cernelle Agreement provides that Pharmaceuticals shall be the exclusive
worldwide distributor of certain oral dosage cancer products Cernelle
Products and is for a term of 15 years from the date of the first commercial
sale by Pharmaceuticals of the Cernelle Products. Pharmaceuticals shall pay to
Cernelle a one time amount of $100,000 upon notification by Cernelle that the
Cernelle Products are ready for shipment to Pharmaceuticals and shall purchase
the Cernelle Products at certain prices as defined in the agreement. In the
event the term of the Cernelle Agreement or any renewal thereof is not extended,
Pharmaceuticals shall have, at a minimum, a nonexclusive worldwide right to
distribute the Cernelle Products for three additional years.
Pharmaceuticals also entered into a technical services agreement,
dated November 5, 1995, with Cernelle Cernelle TSA. The Cernelle TSA
provides that Cernelle will prepare abbreviated new drug applications ANDA
submissions to the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA covering
the Cernelle Products. Pharmaceuticals shall pay Cernelle a fee of $20,000 for
each ANDA submitted to and accepted by Pharmaceuticals. Pursuant to the
agreement, Cernelle assigned to Pharmaceuticals the sole and exclusive right,
title and interest in and to the technical services without further
consideration. The term of this agreement is for 15 years and is renewable on
the mutual written agreement of the parties.
[2]  The Protyde Agreements        Pursuant to an agreement dated as of October 1995 Therapeutics
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Protyde Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protyde have
formed a partnership, Protyde-Bigmar Therapeutics the Partnership, for the
purpose of coordinating the manufacture and marketing of certain pharmaceutical
products products for the treatment of human cancer.
The business of the Partnership is to obtain FDA approval to
market certain products, to manufacture the products, and to market the
products. Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, each of the partners initially
has a 50% interest in the Partnership. The Company will account for its
investment in the Partnership on the equity method. As its initial contribution
to the Partnership, Protyde will contribute to the Partnership up to $3,075,000
in cash, the first $750,000 of which was paid to the Company on March 29, 1996,
with the balance to be contributed at such times and in such amounts

[2]  The Protyde Agreements: continued
so as to enable the Partnership to timely satisfy its obligations, and to make
its payments under the terms of its manufacturing agreement. As Therapeutics'
capital contribution to the Partnership, Therapeutics will cause the Company to
make its manufacturing capacity available to the Partnership under the terms of
the manufacturing agreement.
Under the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership is the sole
owner of all right, title and interest in all FDA-approved ANDAs for any
products submitted for approval by the Partnership. The Partnership is also the
sole owner of all right, title and interest in and to proprietary information
and marketing information which is developed or acquired by a partner or its
affiliates, using partnership funds, or while performing activities subject to
reimbursement by the Partnership. However, during the term of the Partnership
each of the partners has a royalty free, worldwide right to use and practice any
such proprietary information and marketing information for any purpose outside
the scope of the Partnership business.
Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership will
continue until December 31, 2005, unless earlier terminated.
The Company has entered into a manufacturing agreement with the
Partnership and Protyde has entered into a marketing agreement with the
Partnership. Pursuant to the manufacturing agreement, the Company
responsibilities include i acquiring and performing stability testing on all
raw materials and packaging materials necessary for the manufacture of the
products, ii providing production capacity available to the Partnership in
order to meet production obligations, and iii undertaking all measures for
quality control which are either required by the FDA or requested by the
Partnership.
The exclusive right to distribute certain of the Partnership
products in certain territories had previously been granted by the Company to a
third party. Subsequently, the Company included certain of such rights as part
of its contribution to the Partnership. As a result, Protyde may have a breach
of contract claim against the Company. The Company does not believe that the
ultimate outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on its
operations.

NOTE M - Commitments     [1] Employment agreement        In April 1996 the Company entered into a five-year employment
agreement with its President and Chief Executive Officer providing for an annual
salary of $200,000, commencing upon consummation of the initial public offering
subject to increases based on the consumer price index, and bonuses of at least
25% of the base salary.
In addition, the Company has entered into employment contracts
with certain officers and employees pursuant to which the Company has agreed to
pay base compensation aggregating $420,000 per year. These contracts commenced
on various dates between July 1, 1996 and September 30, 1996, and have a term of
two years. The contracts are subject to increases based on the consumer price
index.
[2]  Leases        The Company leases office space in the United States and
Switzerland under various leases.
In March 1996 the Company entered into an agreement to sublease
executive office space from a company of which the Company President was
formerly an officer. The sublease is for a term of two years. The Company also
leases warehouse space in Switzerland under an operating lease expiring through
1999. Rent expense amounted to $56,215 in 1996, and $19,250 in 1995.

Bioren leases part of its Couvet facility to a third party
pursuant to a year to year lease. The rental income for the year ended December
31, 1996 and for the period from July 1, 1995 date of acquisition of Bioren to
December 31, 1995 was $93,136 and $49,144, respectively.
NOTE N - Concentration of Credit Risk     Bioren main customers for intravenous products are hospitals located
in Switzerland. A significant number of these hospitals are owned by the canton
state or the city where they are located and the credit risk traditionally is
not significant. For other pharmaceutical products, the customers are privately
owned and credit risk is greater. The management has recorded its estimate of
credit loss through the allowance for doubtful accounts.
NOTE O - Significant Customers and Suppliers     Sales to significant customers were as follows                       Year Ended

Company obtains containers for IV Solutions from a sole supplier. The Company
reliance on a sole or a limited number of suppliers involves several risks
including, among others, the inability to obtain an adequate supply of required
raw materials and components in order to manufacture or market a product or
proposed product, increased raw material or component costs and reduced control
over pricing, quality and timely delivery.

NOTE Q - Common Stock     Stock options     The Company applies APB No. 25 in accounting for its stock option
incentive plan and, accordingly, recognizes compensation expense for the
difference between the fair value of the underlying common stock and the grant
price of the option at the date of grant. The effect of applying SFAS No. 123 on
1996 pro forma net loss is not necessarily representative of the effects on
reported net loss for future years due to, among other things, 1 the vesting
period of the stock options and the 2 fair value of additional stock options
in future years. Had compensation cost for the Company stock option plans been
determined based upon the fair value at the grant date for awards under the
plans consistent with the methodology prescribed under SFAS No. 123, the
Company net loss in 1996 would have been approximately $2,776,000 or $85 per
share. The weighted-average fair value of the options granted during 1996 are
estimated as $548 per share on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield 0 volatility of 66%, risk-free interest rate of 622% and expected life of five
years.
The Company adopted an option plan providing for the grant of incentive
stock options and nonqualified stock options to directors, officers, employees,
agents and consultants of the Company. The plan provides for the grant of
options to purchase up to 300,000 shares with exercise terms not to exceed ten
years. In addition, the Company adopted a director option plan providing for
awards of up to 50,000 shares of common stock to directors who are not otherwise
