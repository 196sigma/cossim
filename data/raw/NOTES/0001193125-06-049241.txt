PART II  Item 5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of December31, 2005. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other
procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2005, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial
reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies
and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and directors: and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may
deteriorate. We have assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005. In making
this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December31, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting was effective at a reasonable
assurance level based on these criteria. Ernst Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an
audit report, included below, on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
No changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act
occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December31, 2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of NMT Medical,Inc We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting that NMT Medical,Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. NMT
Medical,Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that NMT Medical,Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion NMT Medical,Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets as December31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and shareholders equity for each of the three years in the period
ended December31, 2005 of NMT Medical,Inc. and our report dated March9, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ERNST YOUNG LLP Boston, Massachusetts March 9, 2006
