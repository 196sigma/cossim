Independent Accountants To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
LogicVision, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
LogicVision, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the
related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose, California January 17, 2003

LOGICVISION,
INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 1.FORMATION AND
BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY Nature of Business
LogicVision, Inc. the Company
was incorporated on July 23, 1992 and on September 15, 2000, the Company was reincorporated in the State of Delaware. The Company provides proprietary technologies for embedded test that enable the more efficient design and manufacture of complex
semiconductors. The embedded test solution allows integrated circuit designers to embed into a semiconductor design test functionality that can be used during semiconductor production and throughout the useful life of the chip. The technology also
allows integrated circuits to be tested after they have been assembled onto boards and systems. Stock Split On September 28, 2000, the Companys Board of Directors approved a one-for-two stock split of the Companys common stock. All share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect this share split.
Initial Public Offering In November 2001, the Company completed its initial public
offering of 5,085,000 shares of common stock including 585,000 shares purchased by underwriters over-allotment option at $900 per share. Net proceeds totaled $411 million, net of issuance costs. At the closing of the offering, all of the then
issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock were converted into shares of common stock. 2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Companys fiscal year end is December 31. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, investments,
income taxes, warranty obligations, long-term service contracts, and contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Cash and Cash Equivalents, Short-term Investments and
Marketable Securities The Company considers
all highly liquid investment instruments with original maturities of three months or less at the acquisition date to be cash equivalents and investment instruments with original maturities of more than three months at the acquisition date, but less
than twelve months, to be short-term investments. All short-term investments and marketable securities are classified as held-to-maturity. Interest and realized gains and losses are included in interest income. Realized gains and losses are
recognized based on the specific

Equipment Property and equipment are stated
at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term, if shorter.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Long-Lived Assets The
Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. The Company uses an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flow of the
related asset or asset grouping over the remaining life in measuring whether these assets are recoverable. During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company did not record any impairment to its long-lived assets. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation
arrangements in accordance with provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. 44 FIN 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensationan Interpretation of APB 25 and Emerging Issues Task Force No. 00-23 EITF 00-23, Issues related to the Accounting for Stock Compensation under APB 25 and FIN 44, and Financial Accounting Standards
Board Interpretation FIN No. 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans, and complies with the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
CompensationTransition and Disclosurean amendment of SFAS 123. Under APB Opinion No. 25, compensation expense is based on the difference, if any, on the date of the grant, between the fair value of the Companys stock and the
exercise price. SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148 requires a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument. The pro forma disclosures of the difference between compensation expense
included in net loss and the related cost measured by the fair value method are presented in Note 10. 
44 Table of Contents LOGICVISION, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force EITF No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than
Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services. The Company believes that the fair value of the stock options is more reliably measured than the fair value of the services received. The fair value of each
non-employee stock award is remeasured at each period end until a commitment date is reached, which is generally the vesting date. Revenue Recognition The Company derives license revenues from software and intellectual property licenses and products, and derives service revenues from
maintenance and consulting service contracts. The Company derives revenues from licenses generally with terms between one and three years, which are charged for the right to use the Companys software and intellectual property. Maintenance revenues consist of postcontract
customer support PCS. PCS includes telephone support, bug fixes and upgrade privileges on a when and if available basis. Consulting service revenues typically consist of charges for design service contracts, technology development
contracts, installation and training. The
Company accounts for its revenues under the provisions of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2 as amended by SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9. The Company recognizes license revenues upon shipment
only when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility of the sales proceeds is considered probable. The Company applies the residual method to those arrangements that
include multiple elements, where vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value of the undelivered elements exists. The Company establishes VSOE of fair value for PCS through the use of maintenance renewal clauses in its
contracts, which are substantive, and have historically been purchased by its customers at prices established by management. When VSOE of the undelivered elements cannot be established and the undelivered element is PCS, the entire revenue is recognized ratably
over the term of the PCS. The maintenance elements of these contracts are recognized ratably over the period of the maintenance contract. The Company, on occasion, offers extended payment terms beyond its normal business practice of between 30 and
60 days to certain customers. The Company does not have sufficient experience collecting under these extended payment term arrangements. As a result, when payment terms are extended, the fee is not considered fixed or determinable and, therefore,
the Company recognizes revenues when such payments become due. When the Company enters into a multiple element arrangement which includes the future delivery of a specified product or upgrade, all revenue under the agreement is deferred until the
specified product or upgrade has been delivered. Consulting service revenues are generally fixed-fee contracts recognized on a percentage of completion basis. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on such contracts, which are primarily short-term in nature, are recorded in the
period identified. Research and Development Research and development costs are charged to operations as
incurred. Software Development Costs and Capitalized
Technology License Software development
costs incurred in the research and development of new products and enhancements to existing products are charged to expense as incurred. Software development costs are capitalized after 
45 Table of Contents LOGICVISION, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued technological feasibility has been established. The period between achievement of technological feasibility, which the Company defines as the
establishment of a working model, until the general availability of such software to customers, has been short, and software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the
Company amended its license agreement with Nortel Networks. Pursuant to this amendment, the Company agreed to pay $850,000 in seven quarterly installments of $121,000 beginning March 31, 2001. This amount was included in other long-term assets and
was being amortized over the period of the technology license payment obligation which ended on September 30, 2002. Certain Risks and Concentrations The Companys cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities are maintained at eight financial
institutions, four in the United States, one in Canada, one in Japan, one in India and one in the United Kingdom. Deposits in these institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. For accounts receivable, management of the Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers. Based on the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable balance, the Company maintains an allowance for doubtful
accounts. At December 31, 2002, two customers accounted for approximately 19% and 17% of net accounts receivable, respectively. At December 31, 2001, one customer accounted for approximately 16% of net accounts receivable. At December31, 2000,
two customers accounted for approximately 26% and 12% of net accounts receivable, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2002, two customers accounted for 12% and 10% of total revenues, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2001, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of
total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2000, one customer accounted for 15% of total revenues. For the fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, substantially all of the Companys long-lived assets were located in the United States.
There can be no assurance that the market will
accept the Companys technology as an alternative to current design test development methods. If the market does not accept the Companys technology at all or in the time frame anticipated in the Companys projections, the
Companys revenues and results of operations would be materially affected. The Companys products include components subject to rapid technological change. Significant technological change could adversely affect the Companys future operating results. While the
Company has ongoing programs to minimize the adverse effect of such changes and considers technological change in estimating its allowances, such estimates could change in the future. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. 
46 Table of Contents LOGICVISION, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Foreign Currency
Translation The Company has foreign
subsidiaries whose financial statements are denominated in the local currency. Foreign exchange gains and losses, which result from the process of remeasuring foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars, have been included on the balance
sheet as a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Carrying amounts of certain of the Companys financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
short-term debt, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Net Loss Per Share Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average
number of the common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share does not differ from basic net loss per share since potential common shares from conversion of preferred stock, stock options and warrants and outstanding shares
of common stock subject to repurchase are anti-dilutive for all periods presented. Comprehensive Income Loss The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. This statement requires companies to classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in the financial
statements and display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid-in-capital in the equity section of the balance sheet. For all periods presented, the primary differences between the
Companys net income loss and comprehensive income loss arise from foreign currency translation adjustments. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS 146 addresses
financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities. SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized when the liability is incurred. In summary, SFAS 146
requires that the liability shall be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred, except for one-time termination benefits that meet certain requirements. Since SFAS 146 is effective
prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002, the adoption of SFAS 146 will have no effect on the Companys current financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45
FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantors balance sheet
upon issuance of a guarantee. In addition, FIN 45 requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued, including a reconciliation of changes in the entitys product warranty liabilities. The initial recognition and initial
measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, irrespective of the guarantors fiscal year-end. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for financial
statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Company has adopted this statement. The adoption of FIN45 did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. 
47 Table of Contents LOGICVISION, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
In
December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a
voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS No. 148 also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format. Additionally, SFAS No. 148 requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements. The transition and annual disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 are
effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The interim disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The Company does not expect that the adoption of SFAS 148 will have a material effect
on its financial position or results of operations. 3.PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment were comprised of the following in thousands:  December31 2002 2001 Computer equipment and software

2000 Plan with 1,000,000 shares reserved for grant under the Plan. The Plan was approved by the Companys stockholders in November 2000 and was effective upon the Companys October 2001 initial public offering. The 2000 Plan
is intended to serve as a successor to the 1994 Flexible Stock Option Plan the 1994 Plan and all remaining shares available for grant under the 1994 Plan were authorized for issuance under the 2000 Plan. The number of shares reserved
for issuance under the 2000 Plan will be increased on the first day of each of the Companys fiscal years from 2002 to 2010 by the lesser of 750,000 shares, 35% of the outstanding shares of the Companys common stock on that date or a
lesser amount determined by the Board of Directors. On January 17, 2002, the Board of Directors approved an increase of 520,382 shares to a total of 4,314,404 shares reserved for issuance under the 2000 Plan. As of December 31, 2002, options to
purchase a total of 3,213,334 shares of common stock were outstanding under the 2000 Plan. Under the 2000 Plan, the Board of Directors has the authority to determine the type of option and the number of shares subject to each option. The exercise price is generally equal to fair value of the
underlining stock at the date of grant. Options generally become exercisable over a four-year period and, if not exercised, expire ten years from the date of grant. Under the 2000 Plan, the Board of Directors has the discretion to grant options to nonemployee directors.
Each nonemployee director who first becomes a Board member after the date of the initial public offering may be granted an option to purchase 7,500 shares. In addition, each nonemployee director may be granted on an annual basis an option to
purchase 4,000 shares.
