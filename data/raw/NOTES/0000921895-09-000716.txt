The Board
of Directors and Stockholders
FalconStor
Software, Inc.:
We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FalconStor Software,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive
income loss, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2008.These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Companys management.Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of FalconStor Software, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.
We have
also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of FalconStor Software, Inc.
and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO, and our report, dated March 11, 2009, expressed an
unqualified opinion on the effective operation of internal control over
financial reporting.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board
of Directors and Stockholders
FalconStor
Software, Inc.:
We have
audited FalconStor Software, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. FalconStor Software, Inc. management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting.Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our
opinion, FalconStor Software, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO.
We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of FalconStor
Software, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and
comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2008, and our report dated March 11, 2009,
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements.

FALCONSTOR SOFTWARE, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES
Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements
December
31, 2008
1Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies
aThe
Company and Nature of Operations
FalconStor
Software, Inc., a Delaware Corporation the Company, develops, manufactures
and sells network storage software solutions and provides the related
maintenance, implementation and engineering services.
bPrinciples
of Consolidation
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly owned subsidiaries.All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
cUse
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period.The Companys significant estimates include those
related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, share-based
payment compensation, cost-based investments, marketable securities and deferred
income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The
financial market volatility and poor economic conditions beginning in the third
quarter of 2008 and continuing into 2009, both in the U.S. and in many other
countries where the Company operates, have impacted and may continue to impact
the Companys business. Such
conditions could have a material impact to the Companys significant accounting
estimates discussed above, in particular those around accounts receivable
allowances, cost-based investments and marketable securities.
dCash Equivalents and Marketable
Securities
The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months
or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2008 and
December 31, 2007, the Companys cash equivalents consisted of money market
funds and commercial paper, and are recorded at fair value. At December 31,
2008, the fair value of the Companys cash equivalents, as defined under
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 157, Fair
Value Measurements, amounted to approximately $159 million. As of
December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the Companys marketable securities
consisted of corporate bonds, certificate of deposits, auction rate securities,
and government securities, and are recorded at fair value. As of December 31,
2008, the fair value of the Companys current marketable securities as defined
under SFAS No. 157 was approximately $193 million. In addition, at December 31,
2008, the Company had an additional $12 million of long-term marketable
securities that required a higher level of judgment to determine the fair value,
as defined under SFAS No. 157. As of December 31, 2007, the Companys cash
equivalents amounted to approximately $213 million, and marketable securities
amounted to approximately $307 million. All of the Companys marketable
securities are classified as available-for-sale, and accordingly, unrealized
gains and losses on marketable securities, net of tax, are reflected as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders
equity.
54
As of
December 31, 2008, the Company had $15 million at par value of auction rate
securities included within its portfolio of marketable securities. During the
year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recorded approximately $03 million of
unrealized losses on these auction rate notes. The Company determined the
decline in market value below cost to be temporary based upon the Companys
ability to retain the investment over a period of time, which would be
sufficient to allow for any recovery in market value. Accordingly, based upon
the Companys intent and ability to retain these investments over a period of
time believed to be sufficient to recover the value, it has classified the
auction rate securities as long-term marketable securities on its consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2008. See Note 4 Fair Value Measurements for
additional information.
eFair
Value of Financial Instruments
Effective
January1, 2008, the Company
adopted SFASNo157, except as it applies to the nonfinancial
assets and nonfinancial liabilities subject to FASB Staff Position
FSP
No.SFAS157-2, Effective
Date of FASB Statement No157. SFAS No157
clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair
value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to
measure fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The
three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the
valuation methodologies, is as follows:
Level1Valuations based
on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active
markets.
Level2Valuations based
on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as
quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted
prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not
active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable
market data.
Level3Valuations based
on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with
reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These
valuations require significant judgment.
As of
December 31, 2008 and 2007, the fair value of the Companys financial
instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
payable, and accrued expenses, approximates book value due to the short maturity
of these instruments. See
Note 4 Fair Value
Measurements for additional information.
fRevenue
Recognition
The
Company recognizes revenue from software licenses in accordance with Statement
of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as
amended by SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9, and related interpretations to determine the
recognition of revenue. Accordingly, revenue for software licenses is recognized
when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed and
determinable and the software is delivered and collection of the resulting
receivable is deemed probable. Software delivered to a customer on a trial basis
is not recognized as revenue until a permanent key code is delivered to the
customer. Reseller customers typically send the Company a purchase order only
when they have an end user identified. When a customer licenses software
together with the purchase of maintenance, the Company allocates a portion of
the fee to maintenance for its fair value. Software maintenance fees are
deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract. The
long-term portion of deferred revenue relates to maintenance contracts with
terms in excess of one year. The cost of providing technical support is included
in cost of maintenance, software service and other revenues. The Company
provides an allowance for software product returns as a reduction of revenue,
based upon historical experience and known or expected trends.
Revenues
associated with software implementation and software engineering services are
recognized when the services are performed. Costs of providing these services
are included in cost of revenues.
The
Company has entered into various distribution, licensing and joint promotion
agreements with OEMs and distributors, whereby the Company has provided to the
reseller a non-exclusive software license to install the Companys software on
certain hardware or to resell the Companys software in exchange for payments
based on the products distributed by the OEM or
distributor.Nonrefundable advances and engineering fees received by
the Company from an OEM are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as
revenue when related software engineering services, if any, are complete and the
software product master is delivered and accepted.
The
Company has transactions in which it purchases hardware and bundlesthis
hardware with the Companys software and sells the bundled solution to its
customer. Since the software is not essential to the functionality of the
equipment included in the Companys bundled solutions, and both the hardware and
software have stand alone value to the customer, a portion of the contractual
fees is recognized as revenue when the hardware is delivered based on its
relative fair value.
55
gProperty
and Equipment
Property
and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is recognized using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 3 to 7
years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
terms of the respective leases or over their estimated useful lives, whichever
is shorter.
hGoodwill
and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations.
Consistent with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, the Company has not amortized goodwill related to its
acquisitions, but instead tests the balance for impairment. The Companys annual
impairment assessment is performed during the fourth quarter of each year, and
an assessment is made at other times if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired.
Identifiable intangible assets, which include i assets acquired through
business combinations, which include customer contracts and intellectual
property, and ii patents are amortized over three years using the
straight-line method. See Note 9 Acquisitions for additional
information.
Amortization
expense was $464,495, $229,808 and $182,777 for the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The gross carrying amount and accumulated
amortization of other intangible assets as of December 31, 2008 and December 31,
2007 are as follows:

December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.Such assets will be
fully amortized at December 31, 2011.
iSoftware
Development Costs and Purchased Software Technology
In
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Software
to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed, costs associated with the
development of new software products and enhancements to existing software
products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility of the product
has been established. Based on the Companys product development process,
technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model.
Amortization of software development costs is recorded at the greater of
straight line over three years or the ratio of current revenue of the related
products to total current and anticipated future revenue of these
products.
The
purchased software technology net carrying value of $102,540 and $246,017, after
accumulated amortization of $5,274,891 and $5,131,414, is included in other
assets in the balance sheets as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007,
respectively. Amortization expense was $143,477, $122,560 and $362,159 for the
years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Amortization of
purchased software technology is recorded at the greater of the straight line
basis over the products estimated remaining life or the ratio of current period
revenue of the related products to total current and anticipated future revenue
of these products.
56
As of
December 31, 2008, amortization expense for software development costs and
purchased software technology is expected to be $67,540 and $35,000 for the
years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively.Such assets
will be fully amortized at December 31, 2010.
jIncome
Taxes
Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be realized or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. In determining the period in which related tax benefits are
realized for book purposes, excess share-based compensation deductions included
in net operating losses are realized after regular net operating losses are
exhausted. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to
unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in its consolidated
statements of operations.
On
January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes, FIN 48. FIN 48 is an interpretation of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes,
and addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to
be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under
FIN 48, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position
only if it meets the more likely than not threshold that the position will be
sustained on examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits
of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from
such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a
greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
interest and penalties on income taxes,
accounting in interim periods, and also requires increased disclosures. The
adoption of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 did not result in any adjustment to the
recognized benefits from the Companys uncertain tax positions. The Company
includes interest and penalties related to its tax contingencies in income tax
expense. See Note 6 Income
Taxes for additional information.
kLong-Lived
Assets
The
Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be
recoverable.If the sum of the expected future cash flows,
undiscounted and without interest is less than the carrying amount of the asset,
an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of
the asset exceeds its fair value.
lShare-Based Payments
Effective
January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, which
establishes the accounting for transactions in
which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. Under
the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, share-based compensation expense is measured
at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an
expense over the requisite employee service period generally the vesting
period for awards expected to vest. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R using
the modified prospective method and, as a result, periods prior to January 1,
2006 have not been restated. The Company estimates the fair value of share-based
payments using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of stock
awards is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price
of the Companys common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the
service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The estimation of stock awards
that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or
updated estimates differ from the Companys current estimates, such amounts will
be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. The
Company considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including
types of awards, employee class, and historical experience. Actual
resultsand future estimates may differ substantially from the Companys
current estimates. Stock option exercises and restricted stock awards are
expected to be fulfilled with new shares of common stock.
57
The
Company accounts for stock option grants and grants of restricted shares of
common stock to non-employees in accordance with SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, and Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No96-18,
Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are
Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction
with Selling, Goods or Services, which requires that the fair value of
these instruments be recognized as an expense over the period in which the
related services are rendered.
Prior to
the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company accounted for stock-based
compensation using the intrinsic-value based method under Accounting Principles
Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations, and provided applicable pro-forma
disclosures required by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. Accordingly, prior to 2006, the Company recorded employee
stock-based compensation expense only if, on the date of grant, the market price
of the underlying stock on the date of grant exceeded the exercise
price.
mForeign
Currency
Assets
and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at rates of exchange at the
end of the period, while results of operations are translated at average
exchange rates in effect for the period.Unrealized gains and losses
from the translation of foreign assets and liabilities are classified as a
separate component of stockholders equity.Realized gains and losses
from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statements
of operations within interest and other income, net.During the years
ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, foreign currency realized gains
/losses totaled approximately $199,000, $22,000 and $51,000,
respectively.
nEarnings
Per Share
EPS
Basic EPS
is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding.Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding increased by dilutive common stock
equivalents. Due to the net loss forthe year ended December 31, 2006, all
common stock equivalents of 11,810,975 were excluded from diluted net loss per
share. As of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, potentially dilutive common stock
equivalents included 8,525,928, 6,454,969, and 11,810,975stock options and
shares of restricted stock outstanding, respectively. As of December 31, 2006,
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents included 750,000 warrants
outstanding.

pInvestments
As of
December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company maintained certain cost-method
investments aggregating $1,031,033 and $1,116,457, respectively, which are
included in Other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
During 2008 and 2007, the Company recognized impairment charges of $65,424 and
$124,038, respectively, related to certain of its cost-method investments as a
result of other-than-temporary declines in market value related to certain of
these investments. These charges are included in Interest and other income in
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
During
2007, the Company made approximately $924,000 of various cost-method
investments. Such investments included an $866,000 investment with the Institute
of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Science and other independent
third parties to establish a newly formed company, Tianjin Zhongke Blue Whale
Information Technology Co., Ltd. Blue Whale, that will research, produce and
market enterprise-class storage, archiving and compliance solutions domestically
and internationally. Additionally, during 2007, the Company entered into a
license agreement with Blue Whale, which resulted in approximately $800,000 of
revenue. The license agreement and the investment were separate arms-length
transactions and were not made in contemplation of each other. The Company
evaluates its investments in accordance with the APB No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting
for Investments in
Common Stock, APB 18, and since each of its investments represents
less than 20% of the entity, and the Company does not have significant
influence, the Company accounts for each under the cost-method of
accounting.

rNew
Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2007, the FASB
issued SFAS No141 revised 2007, Business Combinations. SFAS
No. 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer
recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets
acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree
and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141R also
establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and
financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. The adoption of the
provisions of SFAS
No141R will only have an effect on the Companys consolidated
financial statements in the event it enters into any business combinations
subsequent to January 1, 2009.
In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No160,
Noncontrolling
Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statementsan
amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No51. SFAS No. 160
establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in
subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated
net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest,
changes in a parents ownership interest and the valuation of retained
noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No.
160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and
distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the
noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December15, 2008. The adoption of the provisions of
SFAS
No160 is not anticipated to have any impact on the Companys
consolidated financial statements.
In February 2008, the FASB
issued
FSP No.FAS157-2, to partially defer SFAS No157.
FSP157-2 defers the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets
and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at
fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually,
to fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
November15, 2008. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS No157 on
nonfinancial assets and liabilities is not anticipated to materially impact the
Companys consolidated financial
statements. 
In April
2008, the FASB issued SFAS No142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of
Intangible Assets. SFAS No142-3 amends the factors that
should be
considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the
useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No142. The intent
is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible
asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure
the fair value of the asset under SFAS No141R, and other GAAP. SFAS No.
142-3 will be effective for intangible assets acquired beginning January1,
2009. Accordingly, the impact on the Company would be limited to the extent of
any future acquisitions.
In May2008, the FASB
issued SFAS No162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles. SFAS No162
identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting
the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of
nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles the GAAP hierarchy. SFAS No162 will become
effective sixty days following the Securities and Exchange
Commissions
approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU
Section411, The
Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles.
The adoption of the provisions of SFAS No162 is not anticipated to
materially impact the Companys consolidated financial
statements.
In
October 2008, the FASB issued FSP 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a
Financial Asset When
the Market for That Asset Is Not Active. FSP157-3 clarified
the application of SFASNo. 157. FSP157-3 demonstrated how the fair
value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial
asset is inactive. FSP157-3 was effective upon issuance, including
prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued. The guidance
provided by FSP 157-3 is consistent with the Companys approach to valuing
financial assets, for which there are no active markets, including its
investment in auction rate securities. SeeNote 4 Fair Value Measurements for
additional information.
60
In
January2009, the FASB issued FSP No.Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF 99-20-1, Amendments to
the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No99-20,
FSP No.EITF 99-20-1. This FSP provided additional guidance with respect
to how entities determine whether an other-than-temporary
impairment OTTI exists for certain
beneficial interests in a securitized transaction, such as asset-backed securities and
mortgage-backed securities, that ido not have a high quality rating or
iican be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled such that the holder
would not recover substantially all of its investment. FSP No.EITF 99-20-1
amended EITF Issue No99-20 to more closely align its OTTI guidance with
that of SFAS No115, Accounting
for Certain Investment in Debt and Equity Securities. This FSP was
effective for the Company prospectively beginning October1, 2008. The
Company has considered this FSPs additional
interpretation of EITF Issue No99-20 when classifying respective
additional impairments as temporary or other-than-temporary beginning with the fourth
quarter of 2008. This FSP had no material impact on such classifications. See
Note 4 Fair
Value Measurements for additional
information.

clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants. As a basis for considering such
assumptions, SFAS No. 157 establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which
prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair
value:
62
Fair Value
Hierarchy
SFAS
No157 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based upon whether
the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect assumptions other market
participants would use based upon market data obtained from independent
sources observable inputs or reflect the Companys own assumptions
of market participant valuation unobservable inputs. In accordance with SFAS
No157, these two types of inputs have created the following fair value
hierarchy:
Level 1 Quoted prices
in active markets that are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement
date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. The Level 1
category includes money market funds totaling $151 million, which are
included within cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in the
consolidated balance sheets.
Level 2 Quoted prices
for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active,
quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or
financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either
directly or indirectly. The Level 2 category includes commercial paper
totaling $08 million, and government securities and corporate debt
securities totaling $193 million, which are included within cash and cash
equivalents and marketable securities in the consolidated balance
sheets.
Level
3 Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to
the fair value measurement and unobservable. The Level 3 category includes
$12 million of auction rate securities, which are included within
long-term marketable securities in the consolidated balance
sheets.
SFAS
No157 requires the use of observable market data if such data is
available without undue cost and effort.
Measurement
of Fair Value
The
Company measures fair value as an exit price using the procedures described
below for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value. When available, the
Company uses unadjusted quoted market prices to measure fair value and
classifies such items within Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available,
fair value is based upon financial models that
use, where possible, current market-based or independently-sourced market
parameters such as interest rates andcurrency rates. Items valued using
financial generated models are classified according to the lowest level input or
value
driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified in
Level 3 even though there may be inputs that are readily observable. If quoted
market prices are not available, the valuation model used generally depends on
the specific asset or liability being valued. The determination of fair value
considers various factors including interest rate yield curves and time value
underlying the financial instruments.
As of
December 31, 2008, the Company held certain assets that are required to be
measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Included within the Companys
marketable securities portfolio are investments in auction rate securities,
which are classified as available-for-sale securities and are reflected at fair
value. However, during 2008, due to events in the U.S. credit markets, the
auction events for these securities held by the Company failed commencing in the
first quarter of 2008, and continued to fail throughout 2008. Therefore, the
fair values of these securities are estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow
analysis and other type of valuation model as of December 31, 2008. These
analyses consider, among other items, the collateral underlying the security,
the creditworthiness of the issuer, the timing of the expected future cash
flows, including the final maturity, and an assumption of when the next time the
security is expected to have a successful auction. These securities were also
compared, when possible, to other observable and relevant market data, which is
limited at this time.
As of
December 31, 2008, the Company recorded an unrealized loss of $333,055 to
accumulated other comprehensive loss as a result of the declines in the fair
value of auction rate securities. The auction rate securities at December 31,
2008, totaled $1,500,000 par value, and are collateralized by student loan
portfolios, which are almost fully guaranteed by the United States Government.
Because there is no assurance that auctions for these securities will be
successful in the near term, the Company classified the fair value of the
auction rate securities as Level 3 long-term investments. Any future fluctuation
in the fair value related to these securities that the Company deems to be
temporary, including any recoveries of previous write-downs, would be recorded
to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax. Finally, the Company
believes that this temporary decline in fair value is primarily due to liquidity
concerns and not the creditworthiness of the underlying assets, because the
majority of the
underlying securities are almost entirely backed by the U.S.Government.
However, if at any time in the future the Company determines that a valuation
adjustment is other-than-temporary, it will record a charge to earnings in the
period of determination.

Based on
market
conditions, the Company changed its valuation methodology for auction rate
securities to a discounted cash flow analysis and other type of valuation model
during the first quarter of 2008. Accordingly, these securities changed from
Level1 to Level3 within SFAS No. 157s hierarchy since the Companys
initial adoption of SFAS No. 157 on January1, 2008. The following table

During
the year ended December 31, 2008, the Companys deferred tax asset valuation
allowance decreased by $18 million. The decrease in the valuation allowance was
attributable to realization of the tax effects for excess share-based
compensation deductions from the exercises of share-based awards, and such
amounts were recorded as benefits to additional-paid-in-capital.
As of
December 31, 2008, the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $18 million
relates to: i capital loss carry forwards of $07 million; ii net operating
losses related to excess share-based compensation expense deductions of $01
million; iii foreign tax credits of $02million; and iv certain
foreign net operating losses of $08 million. If the remaining valuation
allowance were to be reversed, approximately $01 million would be allocated to
additional paid-in-capital as such amounts are attributable to the tax effects
of excess compensation deductions from exercises of employee and consultant
stock options. The remainder of the valuation allowance of approximately $17
million would reduce income tax expense.
During
the year ended December 31, 2007, the Companys deferred tax asset valuation
allowance decreased by $107 million as a result of the Companys then emergence
from cumulative losses in recent years, and its updated assessments as to its
ability to realize benefits from its deferred tax assets, based primarily upon
its expectations for its then future taxable income. The portion of the
valuation allowance reduction that reduced the provision for income taxes for
the year ended December 31, 2007 was $89 million. The remaining portion of the
valuation allowance reduction related to the realization of excess share-based
compensation deductions of $18 million, which was recorded as a benefit to
additional-paid-in-capital.
66
As of
December 31, 2007, the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $36 million
related to: i capital loss carry forwards of $07 million; ii net operating
losses related to excess share-based compensation expense deductions of $19
million; iii foreign tax credits of $02 million; and iv certain foreign net
operating losses of $08 million.
As of
December 31, 2007, the Company had approximately $51 million of federal net
operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income. These
net operating loss carryforwards related to excess share-based compensation
deductions from previous years exercises of stock options. During the year
ended December 31, 2008, the Company utilized all of its federal net loss
carryforwards which were benefits credited to
additional-paid-in-capital.
The
Company has not provided for the United States income or the foreign withholding
taxes on the undistributed earnings of its subsidiaries operating outside of the
United States, with the exception of China.It is the Companys
intention to reinvest those earnings permanently, and accordingly, it is not
practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable.

Restricted
stock and restricted stock units are fulfilled with new shares of common stock.
The total intrinsic value of restricted stock for which the restrictions lapsed
during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $1,542,308 and $767,756
respectively. As of December 31, 2006, there was no intrinsic value of
restricted stock for which the restrictions lapsed.
During
the first quarter of 2008, the Company issued restricted stock awards to certain
executives and other officers, which vested over three-year terms dependent upon
the Company achieving certain performance targets for the full-year 2008. During
the first and second quarters of 2008, the Company recorded the related
compensation costs associated with the performance awards in accordance with
SFAS No. 123R. During the three-months ended September 30, 2008, the Company
determined the performance criteria to be improbable of achievement and
accordingly reversed compensation cost of approximately $606,000 previously
recognized within its consolidated statement of operations.
During
the third quarter of 2008, certain executives and other officers of the Company
voluntarily forfeited 1,505,046 shares of previously granted stock option awards
the awards. No replacement stock option awards were made, nor did the
Company enter into any agreements for future replacement awards for the
voluntary forfeiture. The voluntarily forfeited awards were fully vested as of
the date of forfeiture, therefore, no adjustment to stock based compensation
expense was recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. The voluntarily
forfeited stock options were awarded during dates ranging from November 2001 to
January 2005, and were expensed at fair market values ranging from $510 to
$803 per share.
The
Company estimates the fair value of share-based payments using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. The Company believes that this valuation technique and the
approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in
estimating the fair value of the Companys share-based payments granted during
the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006. Estimates of fair value are
not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by
the employees who receive equity awards.
The per
share weighted average fair value of share-based payments granted during the
years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $391, $779 and $432,
respectively. In addition to the exercise and grant date prices of the awards,
certain weighted average assumptions that were used to estimate the fair value
of share-based payment grants in the respective periods are listed in the table
below:

Options
granted to officers, employees and directors during fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006
have exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of
grant, a contractual term of ten years, and a vesting period generally of three
years.Based on each respective groups historical vesting experience
and expected trends, the estimated forfeiture rate for officers, employees, and
directors, as adjusted, was 11%, 24% and 9%, respectively. All options granted
through December 31, 2005, had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of
the stock on the date of grant, a contractual term of ten years, a vesting
period of generally three years and an estimated forfeiture rate ranging from 5 - 15%.
Options
granted to non-employee consultants have exercise prices equal to the fair
market value of the stock on the date of grant and a contractual term of ten
years. Restricted stock awards granted to non-employee consultants have a
contractual term equal to the lapse of restrictions of each specific award.
The fair values of the share-based awards are being expensed at their fair value
per share, which was $278, $1126 and $865 at December 31, 2008, 2007, and
2006, respectively. Vesting periods for share-based awards granted to
non-employee consultants range from one month to three years depending on
service requirements. As of December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company
recognized expenses of $140,975, $209,218, and $17,914, respectively, related to
share-based awards granted to non-employee consultants, which are included in
the Companys total share-based compensation expense for each respective
year.
The
Company estimates expected volatility based primarily on historical daily
volatility of the Companys stock and other factors, if applicable. The
risk-free interest rate is based on the United States treasury yield curve in
effect at the time of grant. The expected option term is the number of years
that the Company estimates that options will be outstanding prior to exercise.
The expected term of the awards issued after December 31, 2007, was determined
based upon an estimate of the expected term of plain vanilla options as
prescribed in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No110. The
expected term of the awards issued prior to January 1, 2008, was determined
using the simplified method prescribed in SAB
No107. 
As of
December 31, 2008, there was approximately $12,571,239 of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to the Companys unvested stock options, restricted
stock and restricted stock unit awards granted under the Companys stock plans.
The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 205 years.
As of
December 31, 2008, the Company has 13,757,023 shares of common stock reserved
for issuance upon the exercise of stock options, restricted stock and restricted
stock units.

13Litigation
Settlement Charges
In
January 2007, we resolved claims brought against us by two former shareholders
of IP Metrics, Inc. IP Metrics. When we purchased IP Metrics in July 2002,
part of the contractual consideration was payments to be made in 2003 and 2004
to the former IP Metrics shareholders based on sales of IP Metrics products,
and/or payments to be made if certain events occurred. We made payments to all
four former shareholders in 2003 and 2004. Two of the former shareholders
alleged that they were entitled to additional payments based on the alleged
occurrence of certain contingent events and they brought an action against us.
This action was resolved in January 2007 without any admission of liability, by
the payment of an additional $08 million to the two former shareholders. This
amount was recorded as an operating expense as of December 31, 2006. All claims
in the lawsuit have now been dismissed.
