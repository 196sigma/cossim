INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Dawson Production Services, Inc.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dawson
Production Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 31, 1996 and 1997, and
the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 1997. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Dawson
Production Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 31, 1996 and 1997, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended March 31, 1997, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

acquired the U.S. land-based well servicing operations of Pride Petroleum
Services, Inc.
Pride.
As a result of its acquisitions and certain corporate restructuring, the
Company currently has several direct and indirect subsidiaries through which it
conducts a significant portion of its operations. All of the assets acquired
from Pride are held in Dawson Production Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership the Partnership, and the Company is in the process of
transferring substantially all of its remaining operating assets to the
Partnership. All of the general and limited partnership interests in the
Partnership are owned by two wholly-owned corporate subsidiaries of Dawson;
Dawson Production Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation, owns a 1% general
partnership interest in the Partnership, and Dawson Production Acquisition
Corp., a Delaware corporation owns the remaining 99% limited partnership
interest in the Partnership. Dawson has the following additional wholly owned
subsidiaries: Dawson Production Services de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., and Ubicadora
de Tecnicos, S.A. de C.V., both of which are companies organized under the laws
of Mexico; Taylor Companies, Inc., a Texas corporation; and Mobley Vehicle
Acquisition Corp., a Texas corporation.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated see note 2.
MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
39
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. While it is believed that such estimates are
reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH EQUIVALENTS
For purposes of the statements of cash flows, cash and short-term investments
with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase are
considered to be cash equivalents.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company generally recognizes revenue when services are rendered.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Major renewals and improvements are
capitalized and depreciated over the respective asset useful life.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.
Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
circumstances provide evidence that suggests that the carrying amounts of the
property and equipment may not be recoverable.
Property and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on
the straight-line method. Commencing with the acquisition of substantially all
of Pride Petroleum Services, Inc. U.S. land-based well servicing operations in
February 1997, the Company has utilized a component parts approach to
depreciating fixed assets. Estimated useful lives are as follows                              ESTIMATED
LIFE YEARS
20
Well servicing    3-20
3-5
Office furniture and other equipment.   5-12
INCOME TAXES
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
40
INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS
Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over fair value of net assets
acquired and is amortized on a straight-line basis over twenty to twenty-five
year periods from the dates of acquisition. Other assets consist principally of
loan costs and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the
loans.
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances
provide evidence that suggests that the carrying amount of the intangible asset
may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of the
intangible asset by determining whether the carrying amount of the intangible
asset can be recovered through projected undiscounted future cash flows over the
remaining amortization period.
FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company financial instruments consist primarily of short-term, variable
rate items or recently issued debt instruments for which management believes
fair value approximates carrying value. The carrying value of the $140 million
Senior Notes due February 1, 2007 see note 5 approximates fair value as of
March 31, 1997.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Primary earnings per share is computed by deducting preferred dividends from
net income in order to determine net income attributable to common shareholders.
This amount is then divided by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding and common stock equivalents.
Earnings per share assuming full dilution is determined by dividing net income
plus tax effected convertible debt interest by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the year after giving effect for common stock
equivalents arising from stock options and for convertible debt or preferred
stock assumed converted to common stock.
Pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
83, stock and stock options issued during the twelve months immediately
preceding the Company initial public offering filing date including those
issued in connection with the minority interest acquisition see note 2 have
been included in the calculation of common and common equivalent shares using
the treasury stock method and the anticipated public offering price as if they
were outstanding for all periods. Common stock equivalents resulting from the
conversion or exercise of convertible debt or preferred shares and other stock
options are excluded when their result is anti-dilutive.
41
RECLASSIFICATION
Certain amounts, as previously presented, have been reclassified to conform
with the current year financial statement presentation.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which sets forth alternative
accounting and disclosure requirements for stock-based compensation
arrangements. SFAS 123 does not rescind the existing accounting for employee
stock-based compensation under APB Opinion No. 25. Companies may continue to
follow the current accounting to measure and recognize employee stock-based
compensation; however, SFAS 123 requires disclosure of pro forma net income and
earnings per share that would have been reported under the fair value based
recognition provisions of SFAS 123. The Company has elected to continue to
follow the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 for employee stock-based
compensation and has disclosed the pro forma information required under SFAS 123
see note 8.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
In February 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, which
establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share. This
Standard, effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after
December 15, 1997, replaces the presentation of primary earnings per share with
a presentation of basic earnings per share. In addition, this Standard requires
dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the
statement of operations. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 128 on earnings
per share for 1996 and 1997 will not be material.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments and trade
receivables. The Company places its temporary cash investments in U.S.
Government securities and in other high quality financial instruments. By policy
the Company limits the amount of credit exposure to any one financial
institution or issuer. The Company customer base consists primarily of
independent oil and natural gas producers. During the years ended March 31,
1995, 1996 and 1997, the provisions charged to operations to increase the
reserve for doubtful trade accounts receivable were $223,475, $21,714 and
$270,343, respectively. During the years ended March 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997,
sales to the Company largest customer accounted for approximately 16%, 24% and
200%, respectively, of total operating revenues.
42
2 ACQUISITIONS
PRIDE
Effective February 20, 1997, the Company acquired Pride for approximately $1354
million in cash and acquisition costs of $19 million. The acquisition has been
accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the operating results of Pride
have been included in the Company consolidated statements of income since the
effective date of acquisition. The excess of the aggregate purchase price over
the fair market value of the net assets acquired was recognized as goodwill and
is being amortized over 25 years. The fair value of assets acquired, including
goodwill of $302 million, was $1380 million and liabilities assumed totaled
$18 million. The funds used to acquire Pride were provided by proceeds of sales
of common stock and senior notes through public offerings in February 1997.
TAYLOR COMPANIES, INC.
Effective July 29, 1996, the Company acquired all of the issued and
outstanding stock of Taylor Companies, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of
$12,750,000, consisting of $11,000,000 in cash and a $1,750,000 subordinated
promissory note payable to the selling shareholder. Goodwill recognized on this
transaction amounted to approximately $7,350,621, which is being amortized over
a twenty-year period. The final purchase price allocations for the Pride and
Taylor Acquisitions may be adjusted based on the resolution of certain
pre-acquisition issues.
Assuming the purchases of Pride and Taylor Companies, Inc. had been
consummated as of the beginning of the fiscal year 1996, unaudited pro forma
operating results of the Company would be as follows                              MARCH 31,
1996        1997
Revenues   $  182,219,000    205,382,000
Net income loss..  $  4,003,000    2,169,000 
Primary earnings loss per share..  $     056       021
Fully diluted earnings loss per share..  $     056       021
The pro forma results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the
actual results of operations that would have occurred had the purchase been made
at the beginning of the respective periods.
43
WELL SOLUTIONS, INC.
On November 30, 1994, the Company acquired substantially all of the property
and equipment of Well Solutions, Inc. Well Solutions, a company engaged in
providing oilfield services, for an aggregate purchase price of $18,097,550,
consisting of $15,895,733 in cash, a convertible note payable of $1,500,000 and
closing costs of $701,817. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase
and, accordingly, the operating results of Well Solutions have been included in
the Company consolidated statements of income since the date of acquisition.
The excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair market value of the net
assets acquired was recognized as goodwill and is being amortized over 20 years.
The fair value of assets acquired, including goodwill of $2,451,818, was
$18,534,355 and liabilities assumed totaled $436,805. The funds used to acquire
Well Solutions were provided by long-term borrowings, proceeds of sales of
common stock and subordinated debt and cash from operations.
OTHER ACQUISITIONS  Effective November 1, 1995, the Company acquired the 39% minority interest in
the Company subsidiary, Dawson WellTech, L.C., from WellTech, Inc. in exchange
for the issuance to WellTech, Inc. of 1,329,495 shares of common stock for a
total purchase price of $7,700,000 based on an independent appraisal of the
common stock. Goodwill recognized on this transaction amounted to $385,000 and
is being amortized over 20 years.
Effective March 1, 1996, the Company acquired a portion of the assets of a
small company in Giddings, Texas for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately $1,248,000, consisting of $125,000 in cash and $1,123,000 in
capital leases and a note payable. Goodwill recognized on this transaction
amounted to $97,000 and is being amortized over 20 years.
In April 1996, the Company acquired the assets of two small production testing
companies in Louisiana. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $673,000.
Goodwill and a non-compete agreement were recognized on these transactions which
amounted to approximately $111,000. These items are being amortized over 20 and
five year periods, respectively.
In May 1996, the Company acquired the Texas-based well servicing division of a
non-affiliated company. The aggregate purchase price was $779,000.
In July 1996, the Company acquired the assets of a trucking company in
Louisiana. The aggregate purchase price was approximately $400,000. Goodwill
recognized on the transaction amounted to $50,000, which is being amortized over
a 20-year period.
On January 20, 1997, the Company acquired the liquid services assets of Mobley
Company, Inc. for approximately $50 million in cash and a $500,000 five year
subordinated note. Goodwill recognized on this transaction amounted to
$1,566,000 and is being amortized over 20 years.
44
The other acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases and, accordingly,
the operating results have been included in the Company consolidated
statements of income since the dates of acquisition. The effect on results of
operations would not have been material if such other acquisitions had occurred
at the beginning of the year.
3 MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK
In October 1990, the Company issued 80,800 shares of 10% cumulative
convertible preferred stock for a total price of $1,010,000. Each preferred
shareholder was entitled to receive, in preference to common shareholders,
annual dividends in the amount of $125 per share, payable quarterly. At the
discretion of the Company, the dividends could have been declared in either cash
or common stock valued at $349 a share. Dividends were cumulative and accrued
from the date of the stock issuance. The Company declared dividends on the
preferred stock in the amount of $101,007 in the years ended March 31, 1994 and
1995 and $88,273 in the year ended March 31, 1996.
Holders of the preferred stock elected to convert 20,200 shares of such stock
into 86,860 shares of common stock, effective October 18, 1995. Pursuant to a
November 1, 1995 Agreement for the Conversion of Securities the Conversion
Agreement, the remaining 60,600 shares of preferred stock converted into
260,580 shares of common stock effective February 19, 1996.
4 NOTES PAYABLE AND LONG-TERM DEBT

On February 20, 1997, concurrent with the closing of the Senior Note and
Common Stock offerings and the acquisition of Pride, the Company entered into a
working capital line of credit the Working Line with a bank. The maximum
availability under the Working Line would be the lesser of i $50 million or
ii 80% of eligible accounts receivable that have been outstanding less than 90
days. The Working Line is secured by a first lien security interest on all the
Company accounts receivable. Borrowings under the Working Line mature two
years from the date of any such borrowings and bear interest at the lesser of
i the Bank prime rate of interest or ii a varying percentage rate ranging
from 175% to 275%, based on the total funded debt to cash flow ratio, over the
Company choice of the 30, 90 or 180-day LIBOR rate of interest. The Company
had not drawn against the line as of March 31, 1997, but has used the line to
secure five letters of credit totaling $568,000 related to its worker
compensation insurance program. Under the terms of the loan agreement, the
Company must maintain minimum working capital, tangible net worth, current
ratios and debt to capital ratios. The foregoing description does not purport to
be a complete description of all terms of the Credit Facility.
The Company has $375 million of subordinated debt outstanding at March 31,
1997. Approximately $15 million of the subordinated debt is represented by a
debenture held by Well Solutions, bears interest at 8%, matures on November 30,
1999, is prepayable without penalty at any time, and may be converted at any
time, at the option of the holder, into 37,634 shares of Company Common Stock,
subject to adjustment to prevent dilution. Approximately $175 million of
subordinated debt is represented by a subordinated, non-negotiable promissory
note held by PSD Investments, Ltd., which bears interest at 8%, matures on July
26, 2001 and is prepayable without penalty at any time. In addition, $5 million
of subordinated debt is represented by a promissory note held by Mobley Company,
Inc., which bears interest at 85%, matures on January 20, 2002 and is
prepayable without penalty at any time.
All of the subordinated debt of the Company was incurred in conjunction with
certain acquisitions made by the Company and have offset provisions in
conjunction with unforeseen liabilities that might arise from these
acquisitions. The Company has received a demand for acceleration of payment and
has been served with a lawsuit relating to the $175 million of subordinated
debt held by PSD Investments, Ltd. due to an alleged event of default. However,
the Company believes it is in compliance with the applicable loan covenants and
that an event of default does not exist. Accordingly, the subordinated debt has
not been reflected as a current obligation in the consolidated financial
statements.
In March 1996, the Company elected to prepay a $13,000,000 note payable to a
bank. An extraordinary charge of $513,819 net of income tax benefit of
$264,495 was incurred as a result of the early extinguishment of the note
payable.
During fiscal 1995, $75,000 in principal amount of subordinated notes were
converted into 16,125 shares of common stock. During fiscal 1996, $150,000 in
principal amount of subordinated notes were converted into 27,232 shares of
common stock.
46
Also, pursuant to the Conversion Agreement, $24 million of the Company
subordinated debt converted into common stock at the rate of one share of common
stock for each $698 in principal amount of subordinated debt effective February
19, 1996.

IPO of 2,616,202 shares net of 48 fractional shares paid in cash in
connection with the Recapitalization and Stock Split referred to below of its
common stock for the purpose of raising funds to acquire additional businesses
and to retire debt. Net proceeds to the Company from the IPO, after deduction of
associated expenses, were approximately $23,522,000.
In February 1997, the Company completed a secondary public offering of
4,722,259 shares including 689,773 shares issued in connection with an
over-allotment option of its common stock for the purpose of raising funds to

after deduction of associated expenses, were approximately $55,285,000.
48
b RECAPITALIZATION AND STOCK SPLIT
Effective January 17, 1996, the shareholders approved an amendment to the
Articles of Incorporation which, among other actions, increased the authorized
shares of all classes of capital stock to 20,560,600 and changed the par value
of the common stock to $01 per share. Share and per share amounts for all
periods presented have been adjusted to reflect these changes. The Board of
Directors approved a 43-for-one stock split of the common stock which occurred
on March 1, 1996. Share and per share amounts for all periods presented have
been adjusted to reflect this stock split.
c TREASURY STOCK
During fiscal 1996, the Company retired all of the common shares held in
treasury. The cost of acquired shares in excess of par value was charged to
additional paid-in capital.
8 STOCK WARRANTS AND OPTIONS
In fiscal 1995, 118,250 common stock warrants were issued by the Company to
several officers and directors of the Company. The warrants have an exercise
price of $465 per share. During fiscal 1995 and 1996, employees and officers of
the Company exercised their warrants to purchase 40,618 and 36,546 shares,
respectively, of common stock in exchange for notes payable to the Company of
$66,878 and $75,000. The notes are secured by the shares of common stock issued
and the personal guarantees of the officers receiving the stock.
In October 1995, the Company adopted the 1995 Incentive Plan the 1995
Plan. Under the 1995 Plan, incentive options, non-statutory options,
restricted stock awards, and/or stock appreciation rights may be granted to key
employees, non-employee directors and consultants to purchase the Company
common stock at prices not less than the fair market value at the time of grant,
which become exercisable as described in the respective Award Agreement.
Pursuant to the 1995 Plan, an aggregate of 537,500 shares of the Company
common stock is available for issuance upon the exercise of such options, awards
and rights, which may be granted over a ten-year period. On October 6, 1995,
options to purchase 133,300 shares of common stock at $744 per share were
granted under the 1995 Plan. During fiscal 1997, options to purchase 329,350
shares of common stock at amounts ranging from $1075 to $1225 per share were
granted under the 1995 Plan. Also in fiscal 1997, 21,500 and 5,300 options were
exercised and canceled, respectively, under the 1995 Plan.
49
The following table summarizes the activity of stock options and warrants
granted by the Company:

Exercisable at end of year..    159,179
The weighted average fair value of stock options granted during 1996 and 1997
was $744 and $11375 per share, respectively. The fair value of each option
grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes options-pricing
model. The model assumed expected volatility of 0% and 476%, weighted average
risk-free interest rates of 666% and 675%, for grants in 1996 and 1997,
respectively, and an expected life of 4 years. As the Company has not declared
dividends since it became a public entity, no dividend yield was used. Actual
value realized, if any, is dependent on the future performance of the Company
common stock and overall stock market conditions. There is no assurance the
value realized by an optionee will be at or near the value estimated by the
Black-Scholes model.
As discussed in note 1, no compensation expense has been recorded in 1995,
1996 or 1997 for the Company stock options. Had compensation cost for the
Company stock option plans been determined based on the fair-value at the
grant dates for awards made after March 31, 1995 under that plan, the Company
net income and earnings per common share would have been reduced to the pro
forma amounts indicated below                            YEARS ENDED MARCH 31,

The Company anticipates the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences
will provide sufficient taxable income to realize the benefits of its deferred
tax assets.
For the year ended March 31, 1996, a decrease in deferred income tax expense
resulted primarily from the purchase of the remaining 39% interest in the
Company majority owned subsidiary, Dawson WellTech, L.C. note 2, a reduction
in deferred tax liabilities occurred of approximately $1,400,000 as a result of
the differences in basis of assets for financial reporting and income tax
purposes.
As discussed in note 2, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding
stock of Taylor Companies, Inc. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase
and resulted in an increase in deferred tax liabilities of approximately $25
million due to differences in basis of assets for financial reporting and income
tax purposes.
