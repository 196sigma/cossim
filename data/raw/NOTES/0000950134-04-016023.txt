ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Webco Industries, Inc.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Webco
Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries at July31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended July31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under a2,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein
when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Tulsa, Oklahoma

The accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements. 32 Table of Contents WEBCO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES NATURE OF OPERATIONS - Webco is a full service manufacturer of high-quality
carbon steel and stainless steel tubing products designed to industry and
customer specifications. Webco is also a value-added distributor of these and
other metal tubular products. Webcos tubing products consist primarily of
pressure tubing, including heat exchanger tubing, boiler tubing and pipe, and
specialty tubing for use in durable and capital goods markets. The Companys
subsidiaries include: Webco Tube, Inc. which provides employee services to
Webco, and Phillips Johnston, Inc. PJ, which represents several
manufacturers who produce various specialty tubular products made from copper,
brass, aluminum, stainless and carbon steel, among others. This access to
additional tubing products allows the Company to better serve its customers by
offering a full range of tubular products. The Company, headquartered in Sand
Springs, Oklahoma, has three production facilities in Oklahoma and Pennsylvania
and five distribution facilities in Oklahoma, Texas, Illinois and Michigan,
serving more than 1,000 customers throughout North America. BASIS OF PRESENTATION - The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Webco Industries, Inc. Webco or together with its subsidiaries,
the Company, and its wholly owned subsidiaries Webco Tube, Inc. and PJ, a
Chicago based sales organization and value-added processor of tubular products.
All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated
in the accompanying financial statements. In May, 2002, the Company sold
substantially all of the assets of its QuikWater Division and the disposal was
treated as a discontinued operation. The reader should refer to Note 4 -
Discontinued Operation for additional information regarding this matter. USE OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. CONCENTRATIONS - The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts, which
at times may exceed the federal insurance limits. As of July31, 2004 and
2003, the Company had cash in banks totaling $3,181,000 and $1,530,000,
respectively, in excess of federal depository insurance limits. The Company
has not experienced any losses on such accounts in the past. BOOK OVERDRAFTS - Included in accounts payable at July31, 2003 are
outstanding checks in excess of bank deposits totaling $1,072,000. There were
no outstanding checks in excess of bank deposits at July31, 2004. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE - Accounts receivable represent short term credit granted
to the Companys customers for which collateral is generally not required. The
allowance for doubtful accounts represents probable credit losses and is based
on specific review of customer accounts and customer credit analysis. Accounts
receivable at July31, 2004 and 2003, are net of an allowance for uncollectible
amounts of $242,000 and $636,000, respectively. INVENTORIES - The Company values inventory at the lower of the actual cost to
purchase and/or manufacture or the current estimated market value of the
inventory. Cost for raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods and
maintenance parts and supplies are determined on the weighted average cost
method. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records
a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on inventory
aging and forecasts of product demand and pricing. Inventories at July31,
2004 and 2003 are net of reserves for obsolescence of $1,795,000 and
$1,665,000, respectively. 33 Table of Contents WEBCO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT - Property, plant and equipment is stated at
historical cost and includes interest capitalized on major construction
projects. Gains or losses on sales and retirements of property are reflected
in operations. Depreciation is computed using the straight line method over
the following estimated useful lives: buildings and improvements - 10 to 40
years, machinery and equipment - 3 to 25years, computer equipment and software
3 to 7years, and furniture and fixtures - 3 to 10years. Repair and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation expense for the years ended July31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
amounted to $6,895,000, $6,729,000 and $6,998,000, respectively. Fully
depreciated assets still in use at July31, 2004 and 2003, amounted to
$17,429,000 and $11,469,000, respectively.
ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN LONG-LIVED ASSETS - The Company evaluates its long-lived
assets for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
AssetsSFAS 144. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment
based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets.
In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the
recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated
fair values. SELF-INSURANCE RESERVES - The Company self-insures both a medical coverage
program and an Oklahoma workers compensation program for its employees. The
determination of reserves and expenses for these benefits is dependent on
claims experience and the selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in
evaluating incurred, but not yet reported, amounts. Reserves for claims under
both programs are accrued based upon the Companys estimate of the aggregate
liability for claims including claims incurred, but not yet reported.
Significant changes in actual experience under either program or significant
changes in assumptions may materially affect self-insured medical or workers
compensation reserves and future expense. The reader should refer to Note 8 in
these financial statements for additional information on this matter. REVENUE RECOGNITION - The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC
Staff Accounting Bulletin No104, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements
SAB 104. SAB 104 requires that four basic criteria must be met before
revenue can be recognized: 1persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;
2delivery has occurred or services rendered; 3the fee is fixed or
determinable; and 4collectibility is reasonably assured. Company product is
made to customer or industry specifications at an agreed upon price as
typically specified in the customer purchase order. Title passes to the
customer at the point of shipment along with all the risks and rewards of
ownership. Customer orders are not released for shipment unless the customer
is in good credit standing with the Company, which is internally evaluated by
the Companys credit manager on an on-going basis. Should changes in
conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain
future transactions, revenue recognition would be delayed until such time the
transactions become realizable and fully earned. In addition, the Company
recognizes outbound freight expense and shipping and handling costs as a
component of cost of sales, while amounts charged to customers for such costs
are included in revenue. EARNINGS PER SHARE - Earnings per share are calculated based on the number of
weighted average common shares outstanding, including the effect of dilutive
options when applicable, in accordance with the computation, presentation and
disclosure requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No.
128, Earnings Per Share SFAS No128. 34 Table of Contents WEBCO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - The Company accounts for its natural gas
hedge instruments according to FASB Statement No133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS Nos. 137,
138 and 149. These statements require that every derivative or hedge
instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability
measured at fair value. If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge,
the Company is required to measure the effectiveness of the hedge, or the
degree that the gain lossfor the hedging instrument offsets the loss gain
on the hedged item, at each reporting period. The effective portion of the
gain losson the derivative instrument is recognized in other comprehensive
income as a component of equity and subsequently reclassified into earnings
when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of a
derivatives change in fair value is required to be recognized in earnings
immediately. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment must be
recorded at fair value with gains lossesrecognized in earnings in the period
of change. The
Company enters into natural gas swap instruments which qualify as
cash flow hedges of the
specific underlying exposure natural gas prices, with a risk management
objective and strategy of protecting the Company against dramatic rises in
natural gas prices. The Company records monthly contract settlements as either
an increase or decrease to natural gas expense which is included as part of
cost of sales. At July31, 2004, the Companys natural gas hedges had a
positive net fair value of $295,000. This amount is included in other assets
on the Companys balance sheet with a corresponding credit balance of $174,000,
net of a deferred tax liability of $121,000, reported in stockholders equity
as accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION - The Company has elected to follow APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, in accounting for its employee
stock options rather than the alternative fair value accounting provided for
under SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under APB No.
25, because the exercise price of the Companys stock options is at least equal
to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no
compensation expense is recognized in the Companys financial statements. Pro
forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by
SFAS No123. This information is required to be determined as if the Company
had accounted for its employee stock options granted subsequent to July31,
1995, under the fair value method of that statement. The fair value of options granted in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002
reported below has been estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following assumptions

None The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price
volatility. Because the Companys options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in the opinion
of management, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of fair value of its options. 35 Table of Contents WEBCO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued The weighted average estimated fair value of employee stock options, whose
exercise price equals the market value on the grant date, granted during 2004,
2003 and 2002 was $249, $168 and $175 per share, respectively. There were
no options granted in 2004, 2003 or 2002 with an exercise price exceeding
market value on the grant date. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options calculated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model is amortized
to expense over the vesting period See Note 9 for additional information.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share
if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB
Statement No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and FASB Statement

INCOME TAXES - The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes SFAS No109. The provisions of SFAS No109 require the recording
of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the expected tax consequences
in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities
and their financial statement carrying amounts. Deferred tax assets are
regularly reviewed for recoverability and, if deemed necessary, an appropriate
valuation allowance is established based on historical taxable income,
projected future taxable income, and the expected timing of the reversals of
existing temporary differences. If the Company were unable to generate
sufficient future taxable income, or if there is a material change in the
actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary
differences become taxable or deductible, the Company could be required to
establish a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of the
deferred tax assets, thus resulting in a substantial increase in the effective
tax rate and a material adverse impact on operating results. The reader should
refer to Note 6 in these financial statements for additional information on
this matter. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS - In April2003, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No149, Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities FAS 149. FAS 149 amends and
clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts
collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities under FAS
No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This
statement is effective for the fiscal year ending July31, 2003. The Company
has adopted the provisions of FAS 149 to account for its natural gas hedging
activities in its consolidated financial statements. 36 Table of Contents WEBCO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued In December2003, the FASB issued a revised FASB Interpretation No46
FIN 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, An Interpretation of
Accounting Research Bulletin No51 FIN 46, which was originally issued in
January2003 and provided guidance on identifying entities controlled by means
other than through voting rights and how to determine when and which business
entity should consolidate the variable interest entities VIE. FIN 46R
requires an investor who absorbs the majority of the expected losses and
receives a majority of the expected returns, or both, of a VIE to consolidate
the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the VIE. A VIE is an
entity in which the equity investors do not have a controlling interest or the
equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entitys activities
without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties.
FIN 46R, as amended, was applicable for public companies that have an interest
in a VIE or a potential variable entity, which is commonly referred to as a
special-purpose entity SPE, for periods ending after December15, 2003.
The adoption of FIN 46R did not have a significant impact on the Companys
consolidated financial statements. 2. INVENTORIES Inventories, net of reserves, at July31, 2004 and 2003, consisted of the

37 Table of Contents WEBCO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 4. DISCONTINUED OPERATION On March31, 2002, the Board of Directors approved a plan of divestiture
for the Companys QuikWater Division and on May10, 2002, the Company sold
substantially all of the assets of this segment to a group of independent
investors and members of management of QuikWater, which included Ashley Weber,
daughter of F. William Weber, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the
Company. The purchase price for the assets was $100,000 paid in cash at
closing, the assumption of approximately $70,000 in liabilities and an
additional $300,000 that could be realized based on future earnings of the new
entity over a three year period. None of the additional $300,000 has been
recorded on the sale due the new entity not meeting earnings levels to-date and
management does not expect such levels to be met by May of 2005. The sale of
the QuikWater Division represents a disposal of a business segment under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets FAS 144. Accordingly, prior
years results of the QuikWater segment have been classified as discontinued.
In fiscal year 2002, a pre-tax loss of $914,000 was recorded on the disposal of
the business segment, net of realized proceeds, which includes $80,000 of
related disposal costs.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 5. LONG-TERM DEBT On October15, 2004, the Companys senior debt facilities were refinanced
with the Companys primary lender to provide for a term loan of $18million,
and a line of credit of $50million, both maturing on October15, 2009. The
accompanying consolidated balance sheet has been presented to conform to the
new debt arrangement. The Current Portion of Long-Term Debt and Long-Term Debt
balances in the accompanying balance sheet have been presented to include the
note payments due under the new term loan for the remainder of 2005 and beyond.
As of July31, 2004, the Company had $91million outstanding on the senior
debt facility term loan and $37million on the related revolving line of
credit, which were subsequently refinanced as noted above. Long-term debt at July31, 2004 and 2003, consisted of the following

Based upon the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for
borrowings with similar terms and average maturities, the Company believes that
the carrying amount of its long-term debt approximates fair value.
AThe Company has an $18million term loan and a $50million $155million
and $38million prior to refinancing on October15, 2004 revolving line of
credit with its primary lender group which matures on October15, 2009. The
term loan and revolving line of credit bear interest at the prime rate 425%
at July31, 2004 plus 25% to 75% in the case of the term loan or plus 0% to.5% in the case of revolving loan advances. At the Companys option,
borrowings under any facility can bear interest at LIBOR 147% at July31,
2004 plus 20% to 25% in the case of the term loan or plus 175% to 225% in
the case of revolving loan advances. Interest rate margin percentages are
currently at the lowest level and percentage paid over prime or LIBOR may
change depending on Company performance and the achievement of certain covenant
ratio levels and borrowing base availability. These loans mature on October
15, 2009, and are collateralized by substantially all of the Companys assets.
Principal payments on the term loan of $214,300, plus interest, are due each
month until maturity. Along with the scheduled principal payments, the Company
is required to make additional principal payments on the term loan based on 50
percent of excess cash flow not to exceed $257,100 per quarter, or $1,800,000
on a cumulative basis over the term of the debt facility. The Company may have
borrowings and outstanding letters of credit $1,025,000 at July31, 2004
under the revolving credit facility up to the lesser of $50million or an
amount determined by a formula based on the amount of eligible inventories and
accounts receivable. The Company pays a commitment fee of 025% per annum on
any unused and available line of credit and a fee of 175 to 225%, depending
on Company performance, on the outstanding amount of letters of credit. At
July31, 2004, $4,000 was available for borrowing under the refinanced line of
credit. Under the terms of the new agreement an additional $4,500,000
would have been 39 Table of Contents WEBCO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued available at July31, 2004. Pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement, the
Company is subject to various restrictive covenants, including requirements to
maintain a minimum debt coverage ratio. The covenants also limit capital
expenditures and dividends and require the Company to maintain a minimum
borrowing base availability. In addition, the loan agreement provides for
acceleration of the loans, at the option of the lender, if F. William Weber and
Dana S. Weber fail to possess the power to direct or cause the direction of
management and policies of the Company or that they, together with other
members of the Weber family, cease to own at least 40% of the combined voting
power of all classes of securities of the Company having the power to vote for
the election of directors, or upon the occurrence of a material adverse change
in the operations or financial condition of the business among others. All
financial covenants are measured on the basis of the Company without
consolidating its wholly owned subsidiary, PJ. Accounting principles require current classification of revolving lines of
credit that permit borrowings on a long-term basis when the line of credit
contains both a lock-box arrangement, whereby remittances to the lockbox
automatically pay down the outstanding line of credit, and loan terms that
allow the lender to declare the loan in default on a subjective basis. This
accounting treatment is required regardless of the legal maturity date of the
revolving credit arrangement. The Companys line of credit, which matures
October15, 2009, contains such features and accordingly, the accompanying
financial statements classify outstanding borrowings under the line of credit
as Current portion of long-term debt.
BPJ has a line-of-credit agreement for $1,500,000. The line of credit
matures on November30, 2004, bears interest at the lesser of prime rate 425%
at July31, 2004 or LIBOR 147% at July31, 2004 plus 2%, and is
collateralized by PJs assets and guaranteed by Webco. CThese loans were entered into with various public agencies payable in
monthly installments aggregating approximately $32,000, including interest, at
rates ranging from 3 to 5percent. The notes are collateralized by the
underlying real estate and/or equipment and mature over a 1 to 7year period. DThe Company has various equipment loans with other financing companies
payable in monthly installments of approximately $20,000, including interest,
at rates ranging up to 6percent. The notes are collateralized by the
underlying equipment and mature over a 1 to 5year period. At July31, 2004, the aggregate future maturities of long term debt are as
follows: 2005 $40,688,000; 2006 $3,018,000; 2007 $2,966,000; 2008 $1,652,000;
2009 $245,000; and thereafter $429,000. 40 Table of Contents WEBCO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES LITIGATION In August1997, the Company filed an action against a vendor
relating to certain cut-off equipment sold to the Company, which did not
perform to specifications. The case sought recoveries for the cost of the
equipment and other incidental and consequential damages, including lost
profits, suffered by the Company. On May27, 1999 a jury awarded the Company
$11million on its claims. Both the Company and the vendor appealed the
verdict. In January2002, The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals entered a
decision in the case. The Companys award was affirmed and increased to add
prejudgment interest, but the Companys petition to re-consider the exclusion
of other incidental and consequential damages was denied. The total judgment
of $158million was collected, and neither party is expected to appeal the
decision. The Company is party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the
ordinary course of business. Management, after review and consultation with
legal counsel, considers that any liability resulting from these matters would
not materially affect the results of operations or the financial position of
the Company.
LEASES - The Company leases certain buildings and machinery and equipment under
non-cancelable operating leases. Under certain of these leases the Company is
required to pay property taxes, insurance, repairs and other costs related to
the leased property. At July31, 2004, future minimum payments under
non-cancelable leases accounted for as operating leases are $2,062,000 in 2005 1,881,000 in 2006; $1,646,000 in 2007; $1,398,000 in 2008; and $1,023,000 in
2009. Total rent expense for all operating leases was $3,237,000, $3,322,000
and $3,109,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. SELF INSURANCE - The Company maintains a hospitalization and medical coverage
program for its employees. Claims under this program are limited to annual
losses of $75,000 per participant plus an additional aggregating deductible of
$85,000 for losses in excess of the per participant limit, and aggregate annual
claims of up to $2,000,000 through the use of a stop loss insurance policy.
Additionally, the Company self insures Oklahoma workers compensation claims up
to $300,000 per occurrence and retains a maximum aggregate liability of
$1,000,000 per one year policy term with respect to all occurrences. The
Company has a performance bond in the amount of $550,000 on file with the State
of Oklahoma Workers Compensation Court, as required by self-insurance
regulations. Provisions for claims under both programs are accrued based upon
the Companys estimate of the aggregate liability for claims including claims
incurred, but not yet reported. The total reserve for self-insurance medical
and workers compensation was $1,270,000 and $1,026,000 at July31, 2004 and
2003, respectively. PURCHASE COMMITMENTS - At July31, 2004 the Company was committed on
outstanding purchase orders for inventory approximating $514million. 8. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company maintains a 401k benefit plan covering all employees meeting
certain service requirements. The plan includes a cash, or deferred
compensation, arrangement permitting elective contributions to be made by the
participants. Company contributions are made at the discretion of the Board of
Directors and are made in cash to the participants accounts. Company
contributions were $409,000, $411,000 and $308,000 in fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. 42 Table of Contents WEBCO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 9. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND STOCK OPTIONS In January1994, the Companys stockholders approved the 1994 Stock
Incentive Plan the Plan, in which directors, employees and consultants are
eligible to participate. Four types of benefits may be granted in any
combination under the Plan: incentive stock options, non qualified stock
options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. The Plan also
provides for certain automatic grants to outside directors. All options expire
ten years from the date of grant except in the case of 10percent
shareholders, which expire five years from the date of grant and are
exercisable at a price which is at least equal to fair market value on the date
of grant 110% of fair market value in the case of 10percent shareholders.
The employee options vest evenly over a period of two to five years from the
date of grant. The maximum number of shares of common stock with respect to
which incentive stock options, non qualified stock options, restricted stock,
and stock appreciation rights that may be issued under the Plan is 1,050,000.

Standards No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
InformationFAS 131. Prior to the quarter ended April30, 2002, the Company
had two reportable segments: Tubing Products and QuikWater, representing the
Companys two strategic business units offering different products. However,
as discussed in Note 4, the QuikWater segment was disposed of on May10, 2002
leaving one remaining segment. The Company internally evaluates its business
by facility, however, because of the similar economic characteristics of the
tubing operations, including the nature of products, processes and customers,
those operations have been aggregated for segment determination purposes. As a
result of the QuikWater disposal, the Companys continuing operations only
include activities related to the manufacturing and distribution of tubular
products principally made of carbon and stainless steel. The Company produces tubing for a wide variety of markets and end-use
applications. The percentage breakdown of net sales of the Companys main

owned by the majority stockholders to subcontract certain manufacturing
services. Beginning in late 2000, the Company contracted with the same entity
to subcontract the production of QuikWater units, which ceased with the
disposal of QuikWater in May2002. No payments were made by the Company in
2004 or 2003. During fiscal year 2004, the Company received payments of
$4,000. The outstanding receivable balance was $881,000 and $885,000 at July
31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As of the end of fiscal year 2003, the
Company had discontinued all sharing of services with this entity. The Company purchases certain specialty packaging and shipping materials
from an entity sold by the principal stockholder during the first quarter of
fiscal 2003. Payments of $167,200 and $113,500 were made by the Company in
fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. In addition, the Company charges this
entity for certain shared benefits and services, including telephone and
technical assistance. During fiscal year 2004, the Company had billed charges
of $2,000 and received payments of $2,000. There was no outstanding receivable
balance at July31, 2004 or 2003. The principal stockholder continues to serve
on the entitys board of directors and holds a note receivable, with full
recourse, from the new owners. The Company leases its distribution facility in Nederland, Texas from an
entity owned by certain Company executives. The amount of the monthly lease
payments was determined at the beginning of the lease by an independent
evaluation. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, lease expense under the agreement
totaled approximately $65,000 in each year. Phillips Johnston, Inc., leases a warehouse in Lyndon, Illinois, from an
entity in which the President of PJ is a thirty-four percent owner. During
2004, 2003 and 2002, lease expense under the agreement totaled approximately
$96,000, $99,000 and $95,000, respectively. Advances were made from time to time during fiscal 1998 and prior years
none during 1999-2004 to the principal stockholder with the highest amount
outstanding being $1,200,000 in 2004 and 2003. The balance outstanding at July
31, 2004 and 2003, was $1,200,000. The advance is evidenced by a five-year
promissory note from the principal stockholder and is collateralized by Company
stock and is also a personal obligation. The note bears interest at 397
percent and is payable at maturity of the note on June30, 2007. Accrued
interest on the note receivable was $760,000 and $711,000 at July31, 2004 and
2003, respectively, and is included in notes receivable from related parties in
the accompanying balance sheet. Other advances on various terms were made to certain executives prior to
fiscal 2000, with the highest amounts outstanding being $518,000 in 2004 and
2003. The balance outstanding at July31, 2004 and 2003 was $518,000. Certain
of the advances are collateralized by shares of the Companys common stock and
are also personal obligations of the respective officers. The advances are
evidenced by five-year promissory notes bearing interest at 397percent and
maturing on December31, 2006. Accrued interest on the notes receivable from
related parties totaled $32,000 and $28,000 at July31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, and is included in notes receivable from related parties in the
accompanying balance sheet. 45 Table of Contents WEBCO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
