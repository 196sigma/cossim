FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA  Managements Responsibility for Financial Reporting  The management of Lockheed Martin prepared and is responsible for the consolidated financial statements and all related financial information contained in
this Annual Report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on estimates and judgments, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  In recognition of its responsibility for the integrity and objectivity of
data in the financial statements, the Corporation maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting designed and intended to provide reasonable assurance, based on an appropriate cost-benefit relationship, that assets are safeguarded
and transactions are properly executed and recorded. The Corporation also maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures which includes controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC is gathered and communicated to management for timely consideration of disclosure. An environment that provides for an appropriate level of control consciousness is maintained and monitored and
includes examinations by an internal audit staff, examinations by the independent auditors in connection with their reviews of interim financial information and their annual audit, and audits by the Defense Contract Audit Agency of our compliance
with federal government rules and regulations applicable to contracts with the U.S. Government. In addition, a Disclosure Controls Committee assists in monitoring and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, and to review interim and annual
reports of financial information filed with the SEC for accuracy and completeness.  Essential to the Corporations internal control system is managements dedication to the highest standards of integrity, ethics and social responsibility. To support these standards, management has issued
the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct the Code and developed policy statements that cover, among other topics, maintaining accurate and complete accounting records, proper business practices, regulatory compliance, potentially conflicting
outside interests of employees, and adherence to high standards of conduct and practices in dealings with customers, including the U.S. Government. The Code provides for a help line that employees can use to confidentially or anonymously communicate
to the Corporations ethics office complaints or concerns about accounting, internal control or auditing matters. These matters, if requested by the employee, must be forwarded directly to the Corporations Audit and Ethics Committee. The
importance of ethical behavior is regularly communicated to all employees through the distribution of the Code, and through ongoing education and review programs designed to create a strong compliance environment.  The Audit and Ethics Committee of the Board of Directors is composed of seven
independent directors. This Committee meets periodically with the independent auditors, internal auditors and management to review their activities. Both the independent auditors and the internal auditors have unrestricted access to meet with
members of the Audit and Ethics Committee, with or without management representatives present. 
75  The Audit and Ethics Committee is responsible for the selection, retention and compensation of the
independent auditors. The consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report have been audited by Ernst Young LLP, whose report follows.  s/ Vance D. Coffman s/ Christopher E. Kubasik VANCE D. COFFMAN CHRISTOPHER E. KUBASIK

76  Report of Ernst Young LLP, Independent Auditors  Board of Directors and Stockholders Lockheed Martin Corporation  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Lockheed Martin Corporation as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporations management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Lockheed Martin Corporation at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.  As discussed in Note 1 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2002 the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.  /s/ Ernst Young LLP ERNST YOUNG LLP McLean, Virginia January 27, 2004

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2003  Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies  Organization Lockheed Martin Corporation Lockheed Martin or
the Corporation is engaged in the conception, research, design, development, manufacture, integration and operation of advanced technology systems, products and services. As a leading systems integrator, its products and services range from
aircraft, spacecraft and launch vehicles to missiles, electronics and information systems. The Corporation serves customers in both domestic and international defense and commercial markets, with its principal customers being agencies of the U.S.
Government.  Basis of consolidation and classifications
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned entities which the Corporation controls. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Receivables and
inventories are primarily attributable to long-term contracts or programs in progress for which the related operating cycles are longer than 1 year. In accordance with industry practice, these items are included in current assets.  Certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform with the
2003 presentation.  Use of estimates The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, including estimates of anticipated contract costs and
revenues utilized in the earnings recognition process, that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Due to the size and nature of many of the Corporations programs, the estimation of total revenues and
cost at completion is subject to a wide range of variables, including assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Actual results may differ from those estimates.  Cash and cash equivalents Cash equivalents are generally composed of highly liquid instruments with maturities
of 3 months or less. Due to the short maturity of these instruments, carrying value on the Corporations consolidated balance sheet approximates fair value.  Short-term investments The Corporations short-term investments consist of marketable securities that are
categorized as available-for-sale securities as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards FAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Unrealized gains and losses on those securities are
reflected as a net amount under the caption of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the statement of stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses are recorded in the statement of operations under the caption other income or
expenses. For purposes of computing realized gains and losses, cost is determined on a specific identification basis. The fair values of marketable securities are estimated based on quoted market price for the respective securities. 
82  At December 31, 2003, the Corporation recorded short-term investments with an aggregate amortized cost of
$239 million and fair value of $240 million. There were no short-term investments at December 31, 2002. The investment portfolio was composed of the following:  In millions
AmortizedCost
FairValue
U.S. treasury and government agency securities 125 126
Corporate debt securities 94 94
Mortgage-backed and other securities 20 20 239 240  Over 80% of the
securities had contractual maturities of 1 to 5 years. Proceeds from sales of marketable securities totaled $116 million in 2003. Gross gains and losses related to sales of marketable securities for the year, as well as net unrealized gains and
losses at year-end, were not material.  Receivables 
Receivables consist of amounts billed and currently due from customers, and include unbilled costs and accrued profits primarily related to revenues on long-term contracts that have been recognized for accounting purposes but not yet billed to
customers. As such revenues are recognized, appropriate amounts of customer advances, performance-based payments and progress payments are reflected as an offset to the related accounts receivable balance.  Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
estimated net realizable value. Costs on long-term contracts and programs in progress represent recoverable costs incurred for production, allocable operating overhead, advances to suppliers and, where appropriate, research and development and
general and administrative expenses. Pursuant to contract provisions, agencies of the U.S. Government and certain other customers have title to, or a security interest in, inventories related to such contracts as a result of advances,
performance-based payments and progress payments. Such advances and payments are reflected as an offset against the related inventory balances. General and administrative expenses related to commercial products and services provided essentially
under commercial terms and conditions are expensed as incurred. Costs of other product and supply inventories are principally determined by the first-in first-out or average cost methods.  Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried principally at cost. Depreciation is
provided on plant and equipment generally using accelerated methods during the first half of the estimated useful lives of the assets; thereafter, straight-line depreciation is used. Estimated useful lives generally range from 10 to 40 years for
buildings and 5 to 15 years for machinery and equipment.  Investments in equity securities Investments in equity securities include the Corporations ownership interests in affiliated companies accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under this method of accounting,
which generally applies to investments that represent a 20% to 50% ownership of the equity securities of the investees, the Corporations share of the earnings or losses of the affiliated companies is included in other income and 
83  
expenses. The Corporation recognizes currently gains or losses arising from issuances of stock by wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries, or by equity
method investees. These gains or losses are also included in other income and expenses. Investments in equity securities also include the Corporations ownership interests in companies in which its investment represents less than 20%. If
classified as available-for-sale, these investments are accounted for at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income, in accordance with FAS 115. If declines in the value of investments accounted for under
either the equity method or FAS 115 are determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings currently. The Corporation makes such determinations by considering, among other factors, the length of time the fair value of the
investment has been less than the carrying value, future business prospects for the investee, information regarding market and industry trends for the investees business, and investment analyst reports, if available. Investments not accounted
for under one of these methods are generally accounted for under the cost method of accounting.  Goodwill Beginning January 1, 2002, goodwill is no longer amortized. Goodwill is displayed on the consolidated balance sheet net of
accumulated amortization of $1,382 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002. Under FAS 142 see discussion under the caption Recent accounting pronouncements in this Note, goodwill is evaluated for potential impairment annually by
comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill recorded by the reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, impairment is measured by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its
carrying value, and any impairment determined is recorded in the current period.  Purchased intangibles, net Intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations are amortized over their estimated useful lives unless their useful lives are determined to be indefinite. For
material business combinations, amounts recorded related to purchased intangibles are determined from independent valuations. The Corporations purchased intangibles primarily relate to contracts and programs acquired which are amortized over
periods of 15 years or less. Purchased intangibles are displayed in the consolidated balance sheet net of accumulated amortization of $1,491 million and $1,364 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Amortization expense related to
these intangible assets was $129 million, $125 million, and $154 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and is estimated to be approximately $145 million per year in 2004 through 2006, $125 million in 2007 and
$75 million in 2008, excluding the effects of any future acquisitions or divestitures.  Customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred The Corporation receives advances, performance-based payments and progress payments from customers which may exceed costs incurred on certain
contracts, including contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government. Such advances, other than those reflected as an offset to accounts receivable or inventories as discussed above, are classified as current liabilities.  Environmental matters The Corporation records a liability for
environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. A substantial portion of these costs are expected to be reflected in sales and cost of sales pursuant to U.S. Government
agreement or regulation. At the time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, an asset is recorded for estimated future recovery considered 
84  
probable through the pricing of products and services to agencies of the U.S. Government. The portion of those costs expected to be allocated to commercial
business or that is determined to be unallowable for pricing under U.S. Government contracts is reflected in cost of sales at the time the liability is established.  Sales and earnings Sales and anticipated profits under long-term fixed-price production contracts are recorded
on a percentage of completion basis, generally using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing revenue. Estimated contract profits are taken into earnings in proportion to recorded sales. Sales
under certain long-term fixed-price contracts which, among other factors, provide for the delivery of minimal quantities or require a substantial level of development effort in relation to total contract value, are recorded upon achievement of
performance milestones or using the cost-to-cost method of accounting where sales and profits are recorded based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion.  Sales under cost-reimbursement-type contracts are recorded as costs are incurred. Applicable estimated profits are included
in earnings in the proportion that incurred costs bear to total estimated costs. Sales of products and services provided essentially under commercial terms and conditions are recorded upon delivery and passage of title.  Amounts representing contract change orders, claims or other items are
included in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient
information to assess anticipated contract performance. Estimates of award fees are also considered in estimating sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. Incentive provisions which increase or decrease earnings based solely on
a single significant event are generally not recognized until the event occurs.  When adjustments in contract value or estimated costs are determined, any changes from prior estimates are generally reflected in earnings in the current period. Anticipated losses on contracts are charged to earnings
when identified and determined to be probable.  Research and
development and similar costs Corporation-sponsored research and development costs primarily include independent research and development and bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services. Except for certain
arrangements described below, these costs are generally included as part of the general and administrative costs that are allocated among all contracts and programs in progress under U.S. Government contractual arrangements. Corporation-sponsored
product development costs not otherwise allocable are charged to expense when incurred. Under certain arrangements in which a customer shares in product development costs, the Corporations portion of unreimbursed costs is generally expensed as
incurred. Total independent research and development costs charged to cost of sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001, including costs related to bid and proposal efforts, were $903 million, $830 million and $679 million, respectively. Costs incurred under
customer-sponsored research and development programs pursuant to contracts are accounted for as sales and cost of sales under the contract. 
85  Restructuring activities Under existing U.S. Government regulations, certain costs incurred
for consolidation or restructuring activities that can be demonstrated to result in savings in excess of the cost to implement those actions can be deferred and amortized for government contracting purposes and included as allowable costs in future
pricing of the Corporations products and services. Included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003 and 2002 is approximately $155 million and $215 million, respectively, of deferred costs related to various
consolidation actions.  Impairment of certain long-lived
assets Generally, the carrying values of long-lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in the facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. Any impairment
determined is recorded in the current period and is measured by comparing the fair value of the related asset to its carrying value.  Derivative financial instruments The Corporation sometimes uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Corporation accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Under FAS 133, all derivatives
are recorded as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, and periodically adjusted to fair value. The classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on the intended use
of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives that are not considered highly effective hedges are reflected in earnings. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives
that are considered highly effective hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments related to the fair values of the hedged items, or reflected in other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction
matures and the entire transaction is recognized in earnings. The change in fair value of the ineffective portion of a hedge is immediately recognized in earnings.  Interest rate swap agreements are designated as effective hedges of the fair value of certain existing fixed-rate debt
instruments. Forward currency exchange contracts are designated as qualifying hedges of cash flows associated with firm commitments or specific anticipated transactions. At December 31, 2003, the fair values of interest rate swap agreements and
forward currency exchange contracts outstanding, as well as the amounts of gains and losses recorded during the year, were not material. The Corporation does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Stock-based compensation The Corporation measures
compensation cost for stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. The
Corporation has adopted those provisions of FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended, which require disclosure of the pro forma effects on net earnings and earnings per share as if compensation cost had been
recognized based upon the fair value-based method at the date of grant for options awarded. 
86  For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the options estimated fair values are amortized to expense
over the options vesting periods see Note 12. The Corporations pro forma information follows:  In millions, except per share data
2003 2002 2001 Net earnings loss As reported 1,053 500 1,046 Fair value-based compensation cost, net of taxes 61 67 49 Pro forma net earnings loss 992 433 1,095 Earnings loss per basic share As reported 236 113 245 Pro forma 222 097 256 Earnings loss per diluted share As reported 234 111 242 Pro forma 220 096 253  Comprehensive
income Comprehensive income loss for the Corporation consists primarily of net earnings loss and the after-tax impact of: the additional minimum pension liability, unrealized gains and losses related to available-for-sale
investments, reclassification adjustments related to available-for-sale investments, and other activities related to hedging activities and foreign currency translation. Income taxes related to components of other comprehensive income are generally
recorded based on an effective tax rate, including the effects of federal and state taxes, of 37%.  The accumulated balances of the components of other comprehensive income loss at December 31, 2003 are as follows: minimum pension liability 
$1,239 million; net unrealized gains from available-for-sale investments $44 million; and other activities $9 million.  Recent accounting pronouncements In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a Staff Position that allows companies to
defer recognition of the impact that the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act might have on the benefit obligations they provide their retirees, pending the issuance of specific guidance on the accounting
for the federal subsidy introduced by the Act which, when issued, could require a change to previously reported information. The Corporation elected to defer recognition of the impact of the Act; accordingly, the accumulated post-retirement benefit
obligation APBO for its retiree health care benefits, as well as the net periodic post-retirement benefit cost, included in the Corporations financial statements and the accompanying notes do not currently reflect the effects of the Act. It
is expected that any such change would result in some reduction to the APBO and the net periodic post-retirement benefit cost.  As required, the Corporation adopted FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as of January 1, 2002. Among other things, the Statement
prohibits the amortization of goodwill and sets forth a new methodology for periodically assessing and, if warranted, recording 
87  
impairment of goodwill. The Corporation completed the initial step of the goodwill impairment test required by the new rules and concluded that no adjustment
to the balance of goodwill at the date of adoption was required. In addition, the Corporation reassessed the estimated remaining useful lives of other intangible assets as part of its adoption of the Statement. As a result of that review, the
estimated remaining useful life of the intangible asset related to the F-16 fighter aircraft program was extended from 6 to 10 years, effective January 1, 2002. This change resulted in a decrease in annual amortization expense associated with that
intangible asset of approximately $30 million on a pretax basis.  The following table provides a reconciliation of reported earnings from continuing operations and related per share amounts for the year ended December 31, 2001 to adjusted amounts which exclude the effects of goodwill amortization and
reflect the change in amortization related to the F-16 program for those periods.  In millions, except per share data

Divestitures  In November 2003, the Corporation and
Affiliated Computer Services, Inc. ACS completed transactions whereby the Corporation acquired ACS federal government information technology IT business, and ACS concurrently acquired the Corporations commercial IT business. The
total purchase price related to the Corporations acquisition of ACS federal government IT business, including transaction-related costs, was approximately $585 million. The acquisition was accounted for by allocating the purchase price
to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values, and included recording an intangible asset of $57 million related to a covenant not to compete that will be amortized over 5 years, an intangible asset of approximately $55
million related to contracts acquired that will be amortized over 7 years, and goodwill of approximately $460 million which is not tax deductible. The acquisition expands the Corporations capabilities in business process outsourcing and
managed services, thereby enhancing its ability to support civil and defense government agencies. The divestiture of the Corporations commercial IT business resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $15 
88  
million which was recorded in other income and expenses. The gain increased net earnings by approximately $8 million $002 per diluted share. 
In September 2003, the Corporation announced that a definitive agreement
had been reached to acquire The Titan Corporation Titan. Under the terms of the merger agreement, stockholders of Titan may elect to receive $22 in cash for each share of Titan common stock, an amount of Lockheed Martin common stock based on an
exchange rate, or a combination of cash and stock. Titan stockholders who elect to receive all cash or all stock will be subject to allocation procedures set forth in the merger agreement which require that, in the aggregate, 50% of the shares of
outstanding Titan common stock must be exchanged for the Corporations common stock and 50% of the Titan common stock must be exchanged for cash. The announced value of the transaction, including the assumption of Titans long-term debt,
is approximately $24 billion before accumulated tax benefits. Nearly all of Titans sales are to the U.S. Government. The acquisition remains subject to approval by Titan stockholders and satisfaction of other closing conditions. 
Note 3 Discontinued Operations  In December 2001, the Corporation announced that it would exit its global
telecommunications services business as a result of continuing overcapacity in the telecommunications industry and deteriorating business and economic conditions in Latin America. The Corporation recorded charges, net of state income tax benefits,
totaling approximately $14 billion in 2001 related to this action. The charges decreased net earnings by approximately $13 billion $309 per diluted share. 
The charges related to certain global telecommunications services businesses held for sale included, net of state income tax benefits, approximately
$12 billion for the impairment of goodwill, and $170 million for the impairment of other long-lived assets and exit costs associated with elimination of the administrative infrastructure supporting the global telecommunications businesses and
investments. The charges were included in discontinued operations in the statement of operations, and the results of operations and cash flows of the businesses identified as held for sale were classified as discontinued operations in the
Corporations consolidated financial statements for all periods presented and were excluded from business segment information. The Corporation completed sales of all of the businesses classified as held for sale in 2002 with the exception of
Lockheed Martin Intersputnik LMI. Those transactions did not have a material impact on the Corporations consolidated results of operations or financial position.  The Corporation is continuing to treat LMI as a discontinued operation, as the Corporation is still holding and actively
marketing the business for sale, and there are interested potential buyers. The operating results of LMI had no impact on the statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2003, and were not material for the years ended December 31, 2002 and
2001. LMIs assets and liabilities represented less than 1% of the Corporations consolidated assets and liabilities at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and were included in the consolidated balance sheet in other current assets and other
current liabilities. 
89  In addition, the Corporation completed the sale of Lockheed Martin IMS Corporation IMS, a wholly-owned
subsidiary, for $825 million in cash in August 2001. The transaction resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $476 million and increased net earnings by $309 million $071 per diluted share. The results of IMS operations, as well as
the gain on the sale, are classified as discontinued operations.  Net sales and loss before income taxes included in discontinued operations were as follows:  In millions

reported a net loss from discontinued operations of $33 million $007 per diluted share in 2002. This amount included losses incurred to complete wind-down activities related to the global telecommunications services businesses, offset by the
reversal of a reserve associated with the sale of IMS. When recording the sale of IMS in 2001, the Corporation established transaction reserves to address various indemnity provisions in the sale agreement. The risks associated with certain of these
indemnity provisions were resolved and $39 million, net of taxes, was reversed through discontinued operations in 2002.  Note 4 Earnings Per Share  Basic and diluted per share results for all periods presented were computed based on the net earnings or loss for the respective periods. The weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period was used in the calculation of basic earnings loss per share. In accordance with FAS 128, Earnings Per Share, the weighted average number of common shares used in the
calculation of diluted per share amounts is adjusted for the dilutive effects of stock options based on the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of the convertible debentures issued in 2003 see Note 9 will not be included in earnings per
share calculations until such time as certain contingency provisions that would permit conversion as outlined in the underlying indenture agreement are satisfied.

amounts advanced to Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center Khrunichev, the Russian manufacturer of Proton launch vehicles and provider of related launch services, of $327 million and $391 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, to provide launch services. These amounts are net of a reserve recorded in 2002 related to the Corporations assessment of the probability of termination of certain launches under contract, as well as amounts related to advances
for launches not under contract. Advances for launches not under contract are subject to an agreement which provides for reduced future payments from Lockheed Martin to Khrunichev on launches contingent on the receipt of new orders as well as a
minimum number of actual launches each year, in lieu of the requirement to provide launch services. The charge related to the reserve, net of state income tax benefits, was $173 million, and reduced 2002 net earnings by $112 million $025 per
diluted share. In addition, commercial launch vehicle inventories included amounts advanced to RD AMROSS, a joint venture between Pratt Whitney and NPO Energomash, of $57 million and $61 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively,
for the development and purchase, subject to certain conditions, of RD-180 booster engines used for Atlas launch vehicles.  In 2003, the Corporation recorded a charge, net of state income tax benefits, of $41 million in cost of sales related to its decision to exit the
commercial mail sorting business. The charge, 
92  
which related primarily to the impairment of inventories of the business, reduced net earnings by $27 million $006 per diluted share.  Work in process inventories at December 31, 2003 and 2002 included general
and administrative costs, including independent research and development costs and bid and proposal costs, of $381 million and $502 million, respectively. General and administrative costs charged to cost of sales from inventories for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, including independent research and development costs and bid and proposal costs, totaled $20 billion, $17 billion and $18 billion, respectively.  Approximately $534 million of costs included in 2003 inventories, including $166 million advanced to Khrunichev, are not
expected to be recovered within 1 year.  Note 7 Property, Plant

93  In 2002, the Corporation recorded charges relating to its telecommunications investments, including
Intelsat, Ltd. Intelsat, Inmarsat Ventures, Ltd. Inmarsat Ventures and New Skies Satellites, N.V. New Skies. The charges were recorded as a result of the decline in the values of the investments which the Corporation assessed as being other
than temporary, primarily due to unfavorable trends in the satellite services and telecommunications industries that were not expected to be resolved in the near term. The charges reduced operating profit earnings from continuing operations before
interest and taxes, net earnings and earnings per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2002 as follows:  In millions, except per share data
Operating Profit Net Earnings Earningsper DilutedShare Intelsat 572 371 082 Inmarsat Ventures 101 66 015 New Skies 103 67 015 776 504 112  In December 2003,
Inmarsat Ventures was acquired by a consortium of private equity firms in a leveraged buyout transaction. In exchange for its interest, the Corporation received cash of $114 million and a 14% ownership interest in the new Inmarsat holding company
valued at $96 million. The Corporation recorded a deferred gain of $42 million from the transaction, representing the difference between the consideration received and the carrying value of its investment in Inmarsat Ventures of $168 million. The
Corporation would expect to recognize the deferred gain at such time as it sells all or a portion of its interest in the new company, Inmarsat Holdings, Ltd.  In 2001, the Corporation decided not to make any further investment in Astrolink International LLC Astrolink, and wrote off its 31% equity interest. As
a result, the Corporation recorded a charge, net of state income tax benefits, of $367 million in other income and expenses to reflect the other than temporary decline in the value of its investment in Astrolink. The Corporation also recorded, net
of state income tax benefits, approximately $20 million of charges through cost of sales for certain other costs related to Astrolink. On a combined basis, these charges reduced net earnings for 2001 by approximately $267 million $062 per diluted
share.  In January 2003, the Corporation entered into an
agreement with Astrolinks other members to restructure Astrolink. As part of the transaction, Liberty Satellite Technology, a subsidiary of Liberty Media Corporation, had an option to acquire Astrolinks assets and pursue a business
plan to build a one- or two-satellite system. On October 24, 2003, Liberty Satellite Technology notified the Corporation that they would not exercise the option to acquire Astrolinks assets and build the satellite system. As a result, as
part of the previously disclosed restructuring agreement, Astrolinks procurement contracts were terminated, and the Corporation acquired the remaining ownership interests in Astrolink. The restructuring also entailed the settlement of existing
claims related to termination of Astrolinks procurement contracts with its members, certain of their affiliates and other vendors. Under these settlements, the Corporation retained its work in process. Completion of the restructuring did not
have a material impact on the Corporations financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
94  In 2001, the Corporation recorded a charge, net of state income tax benefits, of $361 million in other
income and expenses related to its investment in Loral Space Communications, Ltd. Loral Space. The charge reduced net earnings by $235 million $054 per diluted share. The decline in the value of the investment was assessed to be other
than temporary due to the downward trend in the market price of Loral Spaces stock and the potential impact of market and industry conditions on its ability to execute its business plans. In July 2003, Loral Space and certain of its
subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In the third quarter of 2003, the Corporation sold its ownership interest in Loral Space. The sale did not have a material impact on the
Corporations results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  In 2001, the Corporation recorded charges, net of state income tax benefits, of approximately $232 million in other income and expenses related to commitments to and impairment in the values of investments in certain
satellite joint ventures, primarily Asia Cellular Satellite System ACeS and Americom Asia-Pacific, LLC AAP. These charges reduced net earnings by $153 million $035 per diluted share.  Note 9 Debt  The Corporations long-term debt is primarily in the form of publicly
issued, fixed-rate and variable-rate notes and debentures, summarized as follows:  Type Maturity Dates In millions,

10105 42 260 6,208 7,557 Less current maturities 136 1,365 6,072 6,192  a
Amounts exclude a $25 million adjustment to the fair value of long-term debt relating to the Corporations interest rate swap agreements which will not be
settled in cash.  In August 2003, the Corporation
completed a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of its outstanding 725% notes due May 15, 2006 and 8375% debentures due June 15, 2024. A total principal amount of $720 million of the notes and debentures were retired. The Corporation
also repurchased $251 million of long-term debt securities from other of its outstanding debt issuances in the open market. The Corporation recorded a loss, net of state income tax benefits, totaling $127 million in other income and expenses related
to the early retirement of the long-term debt repurchased under the tender offer and in the open market. The loss reduced 2003 net earnings by $83 million $018 per diluted share.  Also in August 2003, the Corporation issued $10 billion in floating rate convertible debentures due in 2033. The debentures
bear interest at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR less 
95  
25 basis points, reset quarterly. The interest rate in effect at December 31, 2003 was 093%. Interest on the debentures is payable quarterly through August
15, 2008, after which the interest will accrue as part of the value of the debenture and will be payable, along with the principal amount of the debenture, at maturity. The debentures are convertible by their holders into the Corporations
common stock in certain limited circumstances as outlined in the indenture agreement. Absent certain events not currently anticipated, the debentures are not convertible unless the price of the Corporations common stock is greater than or
equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price for a specified period during a quarter. The conversion price was $7579 per share at December 31, 2003, and is expected to change over time as provided for in the indenture agreement. Upon
conversion, the Corporation has the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock, and also has the right to redeem any or all of the debentures at any time after August 15, 2008.  In the first quarter of 2003, the Corporation issued irrevocable redemption
notices to the trustees for two issuances of callable debentures totaling $450 million. This amount was included in current maturities of long-term debt on the balance sheet at December 31, 2002. One notice was for $300 million of 7875% debentures
due on March 15, 2023, which were repaid on March 15, 2003. The second notice was for $150 million of 775% debentures due on April 15, 2023, which were repaid on April 15, 2003. The Corporation recorded a loss, net of state income tax benefits, of
$19 million in other income and expenses related to the early repayment of the $450 million of debt. The loss reduced 2003 net earnings by $13 million $003 per diluted share.  In December 2002, the Corporation recorded a charge, net of state income tax benefits, of $163 million related to its
investment in Space Imaging, LLC and its guarantee of up to $150 million of Space Imagings borrowings under a credit facility that matured on March 30, 2003. The charge was recorded in light of the Corporations decision, and the decision
of its other major partner in the joint venture, not to provide further funding, its assessment that Space Imaging will likely not be able to repay their obligation under the credit facility when due, and the uncertainties as to whether Space
Imaging would be successful in obtaining the additional investment necessary to fund replacement satellites consistent with their business plans. On March 31, 2003, the Corporation paid $130 million to acquire Space Imagings outstanding
borrowings under Space Imagings credit facility, and the guarantee was eliminated. The Corporation therefore reversed, net of state income taxes, approximately $19 million of the charge recorded in December 2002, representing the unutilized
portion of the credit facility covered by its guarantee. This gain increased first quarter 2003 net earnings by $13 million $003 per diluted share.  In September 2001, the Corporation redeemed approximately $117 million of 7% debentures $175 million at face value due in 2011 which were originally
sold at approximately 54% of their principal amount. The debentures were redeemed at face value, resulting in a loss, net of state income tax benefits, of $55 million which was included in other income and expenses. The loss reduced net earnings by
$36 million $008 per diluted share.  The registered holders
of $300 million of 40-year debentures issued in 1996 may elect, between March 1 and April 1, 2008, to have their debentures repaid by the Corporation on May 1, 2008. 
96  A leveraged employee stock ownership plan ESOP incorporated into the Corporations salaried
savings plan borrowed $500 million through a private placement of notes in 1989. These notes are being repaid in quarterly installments over terms ending in 2004. The ESOP note agreement stipulates that, in the event that the ratings assigned to the
Corporations long-term senior unsecured debt are below investment grade, holders of the notes may require the Corporation to purchase the notes and pay accrued interest. These notes are obligations of the ESOP but are guaranteed by the
Corporation and included as debt in the Corporations consolidated balance sheet.  At December 31, 2003, the Corporation had in place a $15 billion revolving credit facility; no borrowings were outstanding. This credit facility will expire in November 2006. Borrowings under the credit facility
would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at the Corporations option, on the Eurodollar rate or a bank Base Rate as defined. Each banks obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to, among other things,
the Corporations compliance with various representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting the ability of the Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries to encumber assets and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage
ratio.  The Corporations scheduled long-term debt
maturities for the 5 years following December 31, 2003 are: $136 million in 2004; $15 million in 2005; $238 million in 2006; $33 million in 2007; $692 million in 2008; and $5,094 million thereafter.  Certain of the Corporations other financing agreements contain
restrictive covenants relating to debt, limitations on encumbrances and sale and lease-back transactions, and provisions which relate to certain changes in control.  The estimated fair values of the Corporations long-term debt instruments at December 31, 2003, aggregated
approximately $74 billion, compared with a carrying amount of approximately $62 billion. The fair values were estimated based on quoted market prices for those instruments that are publicly traded. For privately placed debt, the fair values were
estimated based on the quoted market prices for similar issues, or on current rates offered to the Corporation for debt with similar remaining maturities. Unless otherwise indicated elsewhere in the notes to the financial statements, the carrying
values of the Corporations other financial instruments approximate their fair values.  Interest payments were $519 million in 2003, $586 million in 2002 and $707 million in 2001.

state income taxes are included in general and administrative expenses, which are primarily allocable to government contracts. The net state income tax expense was $38 million for 2003, and net state income tax benefits were $7 million for 2002 and
$8 million for 2001.  A reconciliation of income tax expense

The change in deferred tax balances related to pensions was primarily due to the recording of an adjustment to reduce the minimum pension liability in 2003.
b
These amounts included $242 million and $559 million, respectively, of net noncurrent deferred tax assets which are included in Other assets on the
consolidated balance sheet.  Federal and foreign
income tax payments, net of refunds received, were $170 million in 2003, $55 million in 2002 and $837 million in 2001. Included in these amounts are tax payments and refunds related to the Corporations divestiture activities. In
addition, these amounts include net tax payments refunds related to discontinued operations of $123 million in 2003, $22 million in 2002 and $179 million in 2001.  The Corporation realized an income tax cash benefit of $140 million in 2002 as a result of exercises of employee stock
options. This benefit is recorded in stockholders equity under the caption, Stock awards and options, and ESOP activity. The benefit for 2003 was not material.

Stockholders Equity and Related Items  Capital stock At December 31, 2003, the authorized capital of the Corporation was composed of 15 billion shares of common stock approximately 446 million shares issued, 50 million shares of series preferred stock no shares
issued, and 20 million shares of Series A preferred stock no shares outstanding.  In October 2002, the Corporation announced a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to 23 million shares of its common stock from time-to-time. Under the program, management has discretion to determine the
number and price of the shares to be repurchased, and the timing of any repurchases in compliance with applicable law and regulation. The Corporation repurchased approximately 107 million shares under the program in 2003 for $482 million, and 1
million shares in 2002 for $50 million. In February 2004, an additional 20 million shares were authorized for repurchase under the program. As a result of the increase, a total of 313 million shares may be repurchased in the future under the
program.  Stock option and award plans In April
2003, the stockholders approved the Lockheed Martin 2003 Incentive Performance Award Plan the Award Plan. Under the Award Plan, employees of the Corporation may be granted stock-based incentive awards, including options to purchase common stock,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or stock units. The maximum number of shares that may be subject to such stock-based incentive awards in any calendar year is limited to 19% of the Corporations common stock outstanding on the
December 31 preceding the grant. The maximum number of shares that may be issued as restricted stock is limited to 18% of the total number of shares authorized to be issued under the Award Plan, or 18% of 225 million shares at December 31, 2003.
Employees may also be granted cash-based incentive awards. These awards may be granted either individually or in combination with other awards. The Award Plan requires that options to purchase common stock have an exercise price of not less than
100% of the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Under the 
100  
Award Plan, no award of options may become fully vested prior to the second anniversary of the grant and no portion of an option grant may become vested in
less than one year, except for 15 million options specifically exempted from vesting restrictions. The minimum vesting period for restricted stock or stock units payable in stock is three years. Award agreements may provide for shorter vesting
periods or vesting following termination of employment in the case of death, disability, divestiture, retirement or layoff. The Award Plan does not impose any minimum vesting periods on other types of awards. The maximum term of an option or any
other award is 10 years. The Award Plan allows the Corporation to provide for financing by award recipients other than executive officers of the exercise or purchase price of common stock underlying an award, subject to certain conditions, by
interest-bearing notes payable to the Corporation.  Prior to
April 2003, the Corporation granted stock-based and cash-based incentive awards pursuant to the Lockheed Martin Corporation 1995 Omnibus Performance Award Plan the Omnibus Plan, which was approved by the stockholders in March 1995.
Awards under the Omnibus Plan were similar to those authorized by the Award Plan except that the Omnibus Plan did not include any minimum vesting requirements. 
In 2003, 25,000 shares of restricted common stock were issued under the Award Plan. In 2001, 25,000 restricted shares were awarded under the Omnibus
Plan. No restricted common stock was awarded in 2002. The shares were recorded based on the market value of the Corporations common stock on the date of the award. Recipients are entitled to receive cash dividends and to vote their respective
shares, but are prohibited from selling or transferring shares prior to vesting. The restricted shares generally vest over 4 to 5 year periods from the grant date. The impact of restricted stock awards was not material to stockholders equity
or compensation expense in 2003, 2002 or 2001.  In April 1999,
the stockholders approved the Lockheed Martin Directors Equity Plan the Directors Plan. Approximately 50% of each directors annual compensation is awarded under the Directors Plan. Directors of the Corporation may elect to receive such
compensation in the form of stock units which track investment returns to changes in value of the Corporations common stock with dividends reinvested, options to purchase common stock of the Corporation, or a combination of the two. The
Directors Plan requires that options to purchase common stock have an exercise price of not less than 100% of the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Except in certain circumstances, options and stock units issued under the
Directors Plan vest on the first anniversary of the grant. The maximum term of an option is 10 years.  The Award Plan, the Omnibus Plan and the Directors Plan, as well as the number of shares of Lockheed Martin common stock authorized for issuance under
these plans, have been approved by the stockholders of the Corporation. At December 31, 2003, the number of shares of Lockheed Martin common stock reserved for issuance under the Corporations stock option and award plans totaled 589 million.

in 2003 under the Omnibus Plan have 10-year terms and generally vest over a 3-year service period. Options granted in 2002 and 2001 under the Omnibus Plan also have 10-year terms, but generally vest over a 2-year service period. Exercise prices of
options awarded for all years were equal to the market price of the stock on the date of grant. Pro forma information regarding net earnings and earnings per share as if the Corporation had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair
value method is included in Note 1. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:  2003 2002 2001 Risk-free interest rate

fair value of each option granted during 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $1778, $1823 and $1332, respectively. 
103  Note 13 Post-Retirement Benefit Plans  Defined contribution plans The Corporation maintains a number of defined contribution plans with 401k
features that cover substantially all employees, the most significant of which are the 401k plans for salaried employees and hourly employees. Under the provisions of these 401k plans, employees eligible contributions are matched by the
Corporation at established rates. The Corporations matching obligations were $238 million in 2003, $232 million in 2002 and $226 million in 2001, the majority of which were funded in Lockheed Martin common stock.  The Lockheed Martin Corporation Salaried Savings Plan is a defined
contribution plan with a 401k feature that includes an ESOP. The ESOP purchased 348 million shares of the Corporations common stock in 1989 with the proceeds from a $500 million note issue which is guaranteed by the Corporation. The
Corporations match consisted of shares of its common stock, which was partially fulfilled with stock released from the ESOP at approximately 24 million shares per year based upon the debt repayment schedule through June 2004. Compensation
costs recognized relative to the ESOP shares were $108 million, $134 million and $90 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The remainder of the Corporations match to the Salaried Savings Plan was fulfilled through purchases of common
stock from terminating participants or in the open market, or through newly issued shares from the Corporation. Interest incurred on the ESOP debt totaled $5 million, $10 million and $13 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Dividends
received by the ESOP with respect to unallocated shares held are used for debt service. The ESOP held approximately 482 million issued shares of the Corporations common stock at December 31, 2003, of which approximately 470 million were
allocated and 12 million were unallocated. The fair value of the unallocated ESOP shares at December 31, 2003 was approximately $60 million. Unallocated common shares held by the ESOP are considered outstanding for voting and other Corporate
purposes, but excluded from weighted average outstanding shares in calculating earnings per share. For 2003, 2002 and 2001, the weighted average unallocated ESOP shares excluded in calculating earnings per share totaled approximately 20 million,
44 million and 67 million common shares, respectively.  Certain plans for hourly employees include a non-leveraged ESOP. In one such plan, the match is made, generally at the election of the participant, in either the Corporations common stock or a different investment choice. The
Corporations contributions to these plans were made through cash contributed to the ESOP trust which was used, if so elected, to purchase common stock from terminating participants or in the open market for allocation to participant accounts.
This ESOP trust held approximately 33 million issued and outstanding shares of common stock at December 31, 2003.  Defined benefit pension plans, and retiree medical and life insurance plans Most employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans, and
certain health care and life insurance benefits are provided to eligible retirees by the Corporation. The Corporation has made contributions to trusts including Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association trusts and 401h accounts, the
assets of which will be used to pay expenses of certain retiree medical plans established to pay future benefits to eligible retirees and dependents. The Corporation uses December 31 as its measurement date. Benefit obligations as of the end of
each year reflect 
104  
assumptions in effect as of those dates. Net pension and net retiree medical costs for each of the years presented were based on assumptions in effect at the
end of the respective preceding years.  The following provides
a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of the plans:  Defined BenefitPension Plans Retiree Medical andLife Insurance Plans In millions

105  The projected benefit obligations PBO for the Corporations more significant defined benefit
pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plans assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002, as reflected in the table above.  At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Corporations consolidated balance sheet included pretax additional minimum pension liabilities of $19 billion
and $25 billion, respectively, related to certain of its defined benefit pension plans. This liability is calculated on a plan-by-plan basis, and is required if the accumulated benefit obligation ABO of the plan exceeds the fair value of the plan
assets and the plans accrued pension liabilities. The ABO for all defined benefit pension plans was approximately $21 billion and $19 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  For defined benefit pension plans in which the ABO was in excess of the fair
value of the plans assets, the PBO, ABO and fair value of the plans assets were as follows:  In millions

as determined by FAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and the net post-retirement benefit cost as determined by FAS 106, Employers Accounting for Post-retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, related to the
Corporations plans include the following components:  In millions

106  The actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations at December 31, 2003 and 2002 related
to the Corporations defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans, as appropriate, are as follows:  BenefitObligationAssumptions 2003 2002 Discount rates
625 675 Rates of increase in future compensation levels
550 550  The actuarial
assumptions used to determine the net expense income related to the Corporations defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, as appropriate, are as follows:  Pension Cost Assumptions 2003 2002 2001 Discount rates
675 725 750 Expected long-term rates of return on assets
850 950 950 Rates of increase in future compensation levels
550 550 550  The long-term rate of
return assumption represents the expected average rate of earnings on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. The long-term rate of return assumption is determined based on a number of
factors, including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term asset allocation of the plans, historical plan return data, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns.  The decrease in the discount rate from 675% at December 31, 2002 to 625% at
December 31, 2003 resulted in a $15 billion increase in the benefit obligations of the Corporations defined benefit pension plans at December 31, 2003. 
The medical trend rates used in measuring the post-retirement benefit obligation were 100% in 2003 and 91% in 2002, and were assumed to ultimately
decrease to 50% by the year 2011. An increase or decrease of one percentage point in the assumed medical trend rates would result in a change in the benefit obligation of approximately 5% and 4%, respectively, at December 31, 2003, and a change
in the 2003 post-retirement service cost plus interest cost of approximately 5% and 4%, respectively. The medical trend rate for 2004 is 110%. 
107  The asset allocations of the Corporations plans at December 31, 2003 and 2002, by asset category,

Investment Management Company LMIMCO, an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, has the fiduciary responsibility for making investment decisions related to the
assets of the Corporations defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. LMIMCOs investment objectives for the assets of the defined benefit pension plans are to minimize the present value of expected
funding contributions and to meet or exceed the rate of return assumed for plan funding purposes over the long term. The investment objective for the assets of the retiree medical and life insurance plans is to meet or exceed the rate of return
assumed for the plans for funding purposes over the long term. The nature and duration of benefit obligations, along with assumptions concerning asset class returns and return correlations, are considered when determining an appropriate asset
allocation to achieve the investment objectives.  Investment
policies and strategies governing the assets of the plans are designed to achieve investment objectives within prudent risk parameters. Risk management practices include the use of external investment managers and the maintenance of a portfolio
diversified by asset class, investment approach and security holdings, and the maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet benefit obligations as they come due. 
LMIMCOs investment policies require that asset allocations of defined benefit pension plans be maintained within the following ranges:
Investment Groups
AssetAllocationRanges
Equity securities
3570 Non-U.S. equity securities
020 Debt securities
1060 Cash
035 Other
015  Current policies for
the plans target an asset mix of 65% in total equity securities and 35% in debt and other securities. 
108  Investment policies for all plans limit the use of alternative investments and derivatives. Investments
in alternative asset classes or structures e.g., real estate, private equity, hedge funds and commodities are limited to 15% of plan assets. Investments in derivatives are subject to additional limitations and constraints, including a maximum
notional value of futures of no more than 5% of plan assets. Use of derivatives to create leverage is prohibited.  Equity securities purchased by external investment managers and included in the assets of the defined benefit pension plans included the
Corporations common stock in the amounts of $137 million less than 007% of total plan assets and $95 million less than 006% of total plan assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Equity securities included in the assets of
the retiree medical and life insurance plans included the Corporations common stock in the amounts of $03 million less than 003% of total plan assets and $14 million less than 02% of total plan assets at December 31, 2003, and 2002,
respectively.  The Corporation generally refers to U.S.
Government Cost Accounting Standards CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules in determining funding requirements for its pension plans. In December 2003, the Corporation made a discretionary prepayment of $450 million to the defined benefit plan
pension trust, the majority of which will reduce its cash funding requirements for 2004. In 2004, the Corporation expects to contribute approximately $50 million$60 million to its defined benefit pension plans, after giving consideration to
the 2003 prepayment, and $310 million$320 million to its retiree medical and life insurance plans.  The Corporation sponsors nonqualified defined benefit plans to provide benefits in excess of qualified plan limits. The expense associated with these
plans totaled $60 million in 2003, $54 million in 2002 and $47 million in 2001.  Note 14 Leases  Total rental
expense under operating leases was $301 million, $235 million and $223 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  Future minimum lease commitments at December 31, 2003 for all operating leases that have a remaining term of more than 1 year were approximately $11
billion $254 million in 2004, $194 million in 2005, $155 million in 2006, $120 million in 2007, $99 million in 2008 and $313 million in later years. Certain major plant facilities and equipment are furnished by the U.S. Government under short-term
or cancelable arrangements. 
109  Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies  The Corporation or its subsidiaries are parties to or have property subject to litigation and other proceedings, including
matters arising under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. In the opinion of management and in-house counsel, the probability is remote that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the
Corporations consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. These matters include the following items:  Environmental matters The Corporation is responding to three administrative orders issued in 1994 and 1997 by the California Regional Water
Quality Control Board the Regional Board in connection with the Corporations former Lockheed Propulsion Company facilities in Redlands, California. Under the orders, the Corporation is investigating the impact and potential remediation of
regional groundwater contamination by perchlorates and chlorinated solvents. The Regional Board has approved the Corporations plan to maintain public water supplies with respect to chlorinated solvents during this investigation, and the
Corporation continues to negotiate with local water purveyors to implement this plan, as well as to address water supply concerns relative to perchlorate contamination. In January 2002, the State of California reduced its provisional standard for
perchlorate concentration in water from 18 parts per billion ppb to 4 ppb, a move that industry believes is not supported by the current studies.  Although this provisional standard does not create any legally enforceable requirements for the Corporation at this time, the Corporation developed and is
in the process of implementing a preliminary remediation plan that would meet the provisional standard if it were to become final. The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003 includes a liability of approximately $180 million representing
the Corporations estimate of the remaining expenditures necessary to implement the remediation and other work at the site. As at other sites, the Corporation is pursuing claims for contribution to site clean-up costs against other potentially
responsible parties PRPs, including the U.S. Government.  The
Corporation has been conducting remediation activities to address soil and groundwater contamination by chlorinated solvents at its former operations in Great Neck, New York which it acquired as part of its acquisition of Loral Corporation in 1996.
This work is being done pursuant to a series of orders and agreements with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation beginning with a 1991 administrative order entered by Unisys Tactical Defense Systems, a predecessor company at
the site. The remediation work associated with this site includes work performed on the site itself, as well as implementation of an interim remedial measure intended to address an off-site plume of groundwater contamination. Future costs are
estimated to be approximately $50 million. This amount is included in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003. As at other sites, the Corporation is pursuing claims against other PRPs, including the U.S. Government, for contribution to
site clean-up costs.  Since 1990, the Corporation has been
responding to various consent decrees and orders relating to soil and regional groundwater contamination in the San Fernando Valley associated with the Corporations former operations in Burbank and Glendale, California. Among other things,
these consent decrees and orders obligate the Corporation to construct and fund the operations of soil and groundwater treatment facilities in Burbank and Glendale, California through 2018 and 2012, respectively; however, responsibility for the
long-term operation of these facilities was assumed by the respective localities in 2001. The Corporation has been successful in limiting its financial responsibility for these activities to date to its pro rata share as a result of litigation and
settlements with other PRPs. In addition, under an agreement reached with the U.S. Government in 2000, the Corporation will continue to be reimbursed in an amount equal to approximately 50% of future expenditures for certain remediation activities
by the U.S. Government in its capacity as a PRP under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
110  
Compensation and Liability Act. The Corporation has recorded a liability of approximately $55 million representing its estimate of the total expenditures
required over the remaining terms of the consent decrees and orders described above, net of the effects of the agreement.  The Corporation is involved in proceedings and potential proceedings relating to environmental matters at other facilities, including disposal of
hazardous wastes and soil and groundwater contamination. The extent of the Corporations financial exposure cannot in all cases be reasonably determined at this time. In addition to the amounts with respect to the Redlands, Great Neck, Burbank
and Glendale sites described above, a liability of approximately $140 million for the other properties including current operating facilities and certain facilities operated in prior years in which an estimate of financial exposure can be
determined has been recorded. In cases where a date to complete activities at a particular environmental site cannot be estimated by reference to agreements or otherwise, the Corporation projects costs over a reasonable time frame not to exceed 20
years.  Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government in
1990 and 2000, certain groundwater treatment and soil remediation expenditures referenced above are being allocated to the Corporations operations as general and administrative costs and, under existing government regulations, these and other
environmental expenditures related to U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing the prices of the Corporations products and services. As a result, a substantial portion
of the expenditures are being reflected in the Corporations sales and cost of sales pursuant to U.S. Government agreement or regulation.  At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the aggregate amount of liabilities recorded relative to environmental matters was approximately $425 million and $445
million, respectively. The Corporation has recorded an asset for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of the Corporations products and services for U.S. Government business. The portion that is
expected to be allocated to commercial business has been reflected in cost of sales. The recorded amounts do not reflect the possible future recoveries of portions of the environmental costs through insurance policy coverage or from other PRPs,
which the Corporation is pursuing as required by agreement and U.S. Government regulation. Any such recoveries, when received, would reduce the allocated amounts to be included in the Corporations U.S. Government sales and cost of sales.
Waste remediation contract In 1994, the
Corporation was awarded a $180 million fixed-price contract by the U.S. Department of Energy DoE for the design, construction and limited test of remediation facilities, and the remediation of waste found in Pit 9, located on the Idaho National
Engineering and Environmental Laboratory reservation. The DoE, through its management contractor, terminated the Pit 9 contract for default on June 1, 1998. The DoEs lawsuit, together with the Corporations counterclaims, was tried in the
U.S. District Court in Pocatello, Idaho from August through November 2003. At trial, the DoE sought damages and interest totaling approximately $100 million. The Corporation sought to overturn the termination for default and damages of approximately
$270 million. The matter is expected to be submitted to the trial court for decision in March 2004. The Corporation has assumed that it will recover some portion of its costs, which are recorded in inventories, based on its estimate of the probable
111  
outcome of the case. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the lawsuit with certainty. The court may award damages to either party in the full amount
it sought at trial or in some lesser amount. The Corporation expects the court to render a decision later in 2004, although final resolution of the lawsuit will likely depend upon the outcome of further proceedings and possible negotiations with the
DoE.  Letters of credit and other matters The
Corporation has entered into standby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain of its contracts. At December 31, 2003, the Corporation had
contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit and other arrangements aggregating approximately $518 million.  Note 16 Information on Business Segments and Major Customers  In 2003, the Corporation announced the formation of Integrated Systems Solutions ISS, a new business
segment, from components of the Electronic Systems and Space Systems segments. ISS is leveraging the Corporations existing and emerging capabilities related to addressing customers growing needs for integrated, net-centric
solutions. With the formation of ISS, the former Systems Integration business segment is now called Electronic Systems. Also in 2003, the Corporation changed the name of its Technology Services segment to Information Technology Services
ITS to better reflect the scope of its activities. The Aeronautics business segment was unaffected by these changes.  The Corporation operates in five business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Space Systems, ISS, and ITS. In the following tables of
financial data, the total of the operating results of the principal business segments is reconciled to the corresponding consolidated amount. With respect to the caption Operating profit, the reconciling item Unallocated Corporate
expense income, net includes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment see discussion below, earnings and losses from equity investments mainly telecommunications, interest income, costs for stock-based compensation programs, the effects of items
not considered part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, Corporate costs not allocated to the operating segments and other miscellaneous Corporate activities. The remaining reconciling item relates to the effects of the
Corporations adoption of FAS 142 in 2002. For financial data other than Operating profit, all activities other than those pertaining to the principal business segments are included in Other.  The FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between pension
expense or income calculated for financial reporting purposes under GAAP in accordance with FAS 87, and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards CAS, which are reflected in the business
segment results. CAS is a major factor in determining pension funding requirements for the Corporation, and governs the extent of allocability and recoverability of pension costs on government contracts. The CAS expense is recovered through the
pricing of the Corporations products and services on U.S. Government contracts, and therefore recognized in segment net sales. The results of operations of the Corporations segments only include pension expense as determined and funded
in accordance with CAS rules. 
112  Transactions between segments are generally negotiated and accounted for under terms and conditions that
are similar to other government and commercial contracts; however, these intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation and for purposes of the presentation of Net sales in the related table that follows. Other accounting
policies of the business segments are the same as those described in Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies.  Following is a brief description of the activities of the principal business segments:  Aeronautics Engaged in design, research and development, systems integration, production, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft and related technologies.

of an Enterprise and Related Information, the following tables of financial data have been adjusted to reflect the changes in the business segments as noted above. This did not result in any changes to the historical operating results in total
for the Corporation.
