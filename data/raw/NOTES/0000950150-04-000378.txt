The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements. 57 Table of Contents AMERICAN STATES WATER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations: American States Water Company AWRis the parent
company of Southern California Water Company SCW, American States Utility
Services, Inc. ASUSand Chaparral City Water Company CCWC. SCW is a public
utility engaged principally in the purchase, production, distribution and sale
of water in California serving approximately 250,000 water customers. SCW also
distributes electricity in several California mountain communities serving
approximately 22,000 electric customers. The California Public Utilities
Commission CPUC regulates SCWs water and electric business, including
properties, rates, services, facilities and other matters. CCWC is a public
utility regulated by the Arizona Corporation Commission ACC serving
approximately 12,100 customers in the town of Fountain Hills, Arizona and a
portion of the City of Scottsdale, Arizona. ASUS performs nonregulated, water
related services and operations on a contract basis. There is no direct
regulatory oversight by either the CPUC or the ACC of ASUS or AWR. The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AWR, SCW, ASUS and
CCWC. AWRs assets, revenues and operations are primarily those of SCW. Basis of Presentation: The consolidated financial statements of AWR
include the accounts of AWR and its wholly-owned subsidiaries SCW, ASUS and
CCWC collectively referred to as Registrant or the Company and are prepared
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Inter-company transactions and balances have been
eliminated. The preparation of these financial statements required the use of
certain estimates by management in determining Registrants assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
current year presentation. None of these reclassifications had an impact on
Registrants Shareholders Equity or Net Income. Utility Accounting: Registrants accounting policies conform to
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
including the accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises, which
reflect the rate-making policies of the CPUC, ACC and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission FERC. The utility subsidiaries, SCW and CCWC, have
incurred various costs and received various credits reflected as regulatory
assets and liabilities. Accounting for such costs and credits as regulatory
assets and liabilities is in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No71 Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation. This Statement sets forth the application of accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America for those companies whose
rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent
third-party regulator. Under SFAS No71, rate regulated entities defer costs
and credits on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it
is probable that those costs and credits will be recognized in the rate making
process in a period different from the period in which they would have been
reflected in income by an unregulated company. These deferred regulatory assets
and liabilities are then reflected in the income statement in the period in
which the same amounts are reflected in the rates charged for service. The
amounts included as regulatory assets and liabilities that will be collected
over a period exceeding one year are classified as long-term assets and
liabilities as of December31, 2003 and 2002. Property and Depreciation: SCW and CCWC capitalize, as utility plant, the
cost of additions, betterments and replacements of retirement units. Such cost
includes labor, material and certain indirect charges. Depreciation is computed
on the straight-line, remaining-life basis, based on depreciable plant as of
the beginning of each year in accordance with Registrants rate making process.
For the years 2003, 2002 and 2001 the aggregate provisions for depreciation for
SCW approximated 30% for its water distribution unit, and approximately 40 38% and 41% for its electric unit for the years 2003, 2002, 2001,
respectively. The aggregate provision for depreciation for CCWC was 25% for
each of the same three years. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are
expensed as incurred. Replaced or retired property costs are charged to the
accumulated provision for depreciation. Estimated useful lives of Registrants utility plant, as authorized by the
CPUC, are as follows   
Source of water supply
30years to 50years   Pumping
25years to 40years   Water treatment
20years to 35years   Transmission and distribution
25years to 50years   Other plant
7years to 40years 58 Table of Contents Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. In August2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which supercedes SFAS No.
121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed Of. This Statement retains the fundamental provisions of
SFAS No121 for the measurement and recognition of the impairment of
long-lived assets to be held and used, as well as the measurement of long-lived
assets to be disposed of by sale. SFAS No144 resolves implementation issues
related to SFAS No121, and retains the amendments in SFAS No121 pertaining
to regulatory assets under SFAS No71 and SFAS No90, Regulated Enterprises
Accounting for Abandonments and Disallowances of Plant Costs. Effective
January1, 2002, Registrant adopted SFAS No144. The adoption of SFAS No144
did not have an impact on Registrants consolidated financial statements. Goodwill: At December31, 2003 and 2002, Registrant had approximately
$123million of goodwill included in Other Property and Investments. The
goodwill represents the difference between the aggregate purchase price and the
fair value of CCWCs net assets acquired at the time of closing, and was being
amortized over a period of 40years. Effective January1, 2002, Registrant
adopted SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and the provisions
of SFAS No141, Business Combinations, which were required to be adopted
concurrent with the adoption of SFAS No142. Pursuant to SFAS No142, AWR
completed its transitional goodwill impairment evaluation and determined that
none of the recorded goodwill was impaired. As a result of the adoption of SFAS
No142, the amortization of this goodwill ceased effective January1, 2002. In
accordance with SFAS No142, goodwill is tested for impairment at least
annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate that it may be impaired.
The goodwill impairment model is a two-step process. First, it requires a
comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related
operations that have goodwill assigned to them. If the fair value is
determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute
the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is
estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations used in the first
step, and is compared to its carrying value. The amount by which carrying
value exceeds fair value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. Current
year analysis indicated no impairment. The following table reflects Registrants earnings available for Common
Shareholders and earnings per share adjusted to reflect the discontinuance of
periodic goodwill amortization for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively

Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents include short-term
cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less. At times,
cash and cash equivalent balances may be in excess of federally insured limits.
The Companys cash and cash equivalents are held with financial institutions
with high credit standings. Interest: Interest is generally not capitalized for financial reporting
purposes as such policy is not followed in Registrants ratemaking process.
Interest expense is fully recovered through the regulatory process as incurred. 59 Table of Contents Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued Revenues: Revenues include amounts billed to customers for services
provided and unbilled revenues representing estimated amounts to be billed for
usage from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting period. Basic Earnings Per Common Share: Basic earnings per Common Share are based
upon the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding and net income
after deducting preferred dividend requirements. Fully Diluted Earnings Per Common Share: Diluted earnings per Common Share
are based upon the weighted average number of Common Shares including both
outstanding and shares potentially issued in connection with stock options
granted under Registrants 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, and net income after
deducting preferred dividend requirements. At December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
there were 333,679, 237,610 and 135,970 options outstanding, respectively.
Outstanding stock options issued by the Registrant represent the only dilutive
effect reflected in diluted weighted average shares outstanding. The
difference between basic and diluted EPS is the effect of stock options that,
under the treasury share method, give rise to common stock equivalents. Debt Issuance Costs and Redemption Premiums: Original debt issuance costs
are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the respective issues. Premiums
paid on the early redemption of debt, which is reacquired through refunding,
are deferred and amortized over the life of the debt issued to finance the
refunding. Other Credits and Liabilities: For SCW, advances for construction
represent amounts advanced by developers, which are generally refundable at
rates ranging from 10% to 22% of the revenue received from the installations
for which funds were advanced or in equal annual installments over periods of
time ranging from 10 to 40-year periods. Contributions-in-aid of construction
are similar to advances, but require no refunding and are amortized over the
useful lives of the related property. For CCWC, advances for construction
represent amounts advanced by developers which are refundable over 10 to 20
years. Refund amounts under the contracts are based on annual revenues from the
extensions. In October2003, Registrant entered into a Premium Finance Agreement with
a third-party to finance the Companys annual insurance premiums for the
2003-2004 policy year. Total amount financed was approximately $20million
and is payable in nine equal monthly installments beginning on November1,
2003, and bears an annual interest rate of 24%. As of December31, 2003,
approximately $13million remained outstanding under this agreement and has
been included in Other current liabilities on the balance sheets. Derivative Instrument: Registrant has certain block-forward purchase power
contracts that are subject to SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS Nos. 138 and 149. A
derivative financial instrument or other contract derives its value from
another investment or designated benchmark. SFAS No133 requires companies to
record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities, and to
measure those instruments at their fair value. Certain of these contracts
qualify as an exception provided under the Statement for activities that are
considered normal purchases and normal sales. These contracts are reflected in
the statements of income at the time of contract settlement. This Statement, as
amended, became effective for Registrants financial statements at the
beginning of fiscal year 2001. This Statement did not have any impact on
Registrants financial statements at the time of adoption. During 2002, SCW became a party to block-forward purchase power contracts
that qualify as derivative instruments under SFAS No133. Contracts with
Pinnacle West Capital Corporation PWCCwhich became effective in November
2002 have not been designated as normal purchases and normal sales and, as a
result, have been recognized at fair market value on the balance sheets as of
December31, 2003 and 2002. This resulted in a pre-tax unrealized gain of
$638,000 and a pre-tax unrealized loss of $25million in 2003 and 2002,
respectively. On a quarterly basis, the related asset or liability is adjusted
to reflect the fair market value at the end of the quarter. As this contract is
settled, the realized gains or losses will be recorded in power purchased for
resale, and the unrealized gains or losses will be reversed. The market prices
used to determine the fair value for this derivative instrument were estimated
based on independent sources such as broker quotes and publications. 60 Table of Contents Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued Under the terms of its power purchase contracts with Mirant Americas
Energy Marketing, LP Mirant Marketing and PWCC, SCW is required to post
security, at the request of the seller, if SCW is in default under the terms of
the contract and the future value of the contract is greater than the future
value of contracts of a similar term on the date of default. SCW will be in
default under the terms of these contracts if its debt is rated less than BBB-
by Standard Poors Ratings Service SP or Fitch, Inc. Fitch or less
than Baa3 by Moodys Investor Services, Inc Moodys. SCW currently has a
rating of A by S P and A2 by Moodys. Fitch does not rate SCW. Except as discussed above, Registrant has no other derivative financial
instruments, financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk or financial
instruments with concentrations of credit risk. Fair Value of Financial Instruments: For cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt, the carrying amount
is assumed to approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of the
amounts. The table below estimates the fair value of long-term debt held by
Registrant. Rates available to Registrant at December31, 2003 and 2002 for
debt with similar terms and remaining maturities were used to estimate fair
value for long-term debt. Changes in the assumptions will produce differing
results.

Stock Options: Registrant has a Stock Incentive Plan, which is described
more fully in Note 10. Registrant applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion
APBNo25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, in accounting for its
stock options which uses the intrinsic value method. Accordingly, no
compensation expense for the Plan has been recognized for options granted at
fair value at the date of grant. Registrant has also adopted the
disclosure-only requirements of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. If Registrant had elected to adopt the optional recognition
provisions of SFAS No123 for its stock options, net income and earnings per
share applicable to common shareholders would have been changed to the pro

61 Table of Contents Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued New Accounting Pronouncements: The following are recent accounting
pronouncements that were adopted effective January1, 2003 or will be effective
in 2004 Effective January1, 2003, Registrant adopted SFAS No143, Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires businesses to record the fair
value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which
it is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity
capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived
asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period,
and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related
asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the
obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement.
Registrants legal obligations for retirement reflect principally the
retirement of wells, which by law need to be destroyed and filled at the time
of removal. As such, the regulated subsidiaries of AWR incur asset retirement
obligations. Retirement costs have historically been recovered through rates at
the time of retirement. Accordingly, at implementation of SFAS No143, the
cumulative effect has been reflected as a regulatory asset. Registrant will
also reflect the gain or loss at settlement as a regulatory asset or liability
on the balance sheet. With regards to other long-lived assets, such assets
either have indefinite lives or there is no legal obligation to retire the
asset. Upon adoption of SFAS No143 on January1, 2003, Registrant recorded the
fair value of the asset retirement obligation of $132million at its net
present value of $27million, increased depreciable assets by $04million for
asset retirement costs, increased regulatory assets by $25million and
increased accumulated depreciation by $02million. Amounts recorded under SFAS
No143 are subject to various assumptions and determinations, such as
determining whether a legal obligation exists to remove assets, and estimating
the fair value of the costs of removal, when final removal will occur and the
credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates to be utilized on discounting future
liabilities. Changes that may arise over time with regard to these assumptions
will change amounts recorded in the future. Estimating the fair value of the
costs of removal were determined based on third party costs The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending aggregate
carrying amount of the asset retirement obligations ARO which is included

If SFAS No143 had been in place on January1, 2002, Registrants ARO as
of that date would not have differed significantly from amounts recorded as of
January1, 2003 upon adoption. If the standard had been applied retroactively
for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001, it would not have had any
impact on Registrants results of operations. SFAS No145, Rescission of SFAS Nos. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of SFAS
No13, and Technical Corrections: Among other things, SFAS No145 rescinds
various pronouncements regarding early extinguishment of debt and allows
extraordinary accounting treatment for early extinguishment only when the
provisions of APB No30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the
Effects of Disposal of a Segment of Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and
Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, are met. This Statement also
amends SFAS No13 to require sale-leaseback accounting for certain lease
modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback
transactions. SFAS No145 provisions were effective for fiscal years beginning
after May15, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No145 did not have any impact on
Registrants financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 62 Table of Contents Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities: This Statement addresses significant issues regarding the
recognition, measurement, and reporting of costs associated with exit or
disposal activities, and supercedes Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No94-3,
Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other
Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring. Costs addressed by SFAS No146 include costs to terminate a
contract that is not a capital lease, costs of involuntary employee termination
benefits pursuant to a one-time benefit arrangement, costs to consolidate
facilities, and costs to relocate employees. This Statement was effective for
exit or disposal activities that were initiated after December31, 2002. The
adoption of SFAS No146 did not have an effect on Registrants financial
position, results of operations or cash flows as Registrant did not exit,
discontinue or restructure any of its operations. However, unknown at this
time, the timing of expense recognition in Registrants financial statements
for future restructuring, exit or disposal activities could differ
significantly. SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and
Disclosure: This Statement amends SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary
change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. In addition, SFAS No148 amends the disclosure requirements of
SFAS No123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim
financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Although
Registrant is required to comply with the requirements of SFAS No148
beginning January1, 2003, the Company has elected to continue to apply the
recognition and measurement provisions of APB No25. Therefore, SFAS No148
did not have any impact on Registrants financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. Registrant adopted the disclosure-only requirements
of SFAS No148, which are included in Note 1 above. In April2003, the FASB issued SFAS No149, Amendment of Statement 133
on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This Statement amends and
clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for
hedging activities under SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities. This Statement is effective for contracts entered into
or modified after June30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after
June30, 2003. All provisions of this Statement will be applied prospectively.
Registrant has not entered into or modified any contracts or designated any
hedging relationships after June30, 2003. This Statement also requires that
any financing element of a derivative contract should be included in cash flows
from financing activities in the Statement of Cash Flows. For the year ended
December31, 2003, Registrant has reflected in its Statement of Cash Flows
approximately $18million related to the financing portion of the purchased
power contracts with PWCC. In June2003, the FASB issued SFAS No150, Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity.
This Statement specifies that instruments within its scope embody obligations
of the issuer and that, therefore, the issuer must classify them as
liabilities. This Statement was effective July1, 2003. Registrant does not
have any financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and
equity. FASB Interpretation No45: Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others. This interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a
guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations
under certain guarantees that it has issued and requires that they be recorded
at fair value. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this
interpretation are to be applied only on a prospective basis to guarantees
issued or modified after December31, 2002. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have
any impact on Registrants financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. FASB Interpretation No. FIN46, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities This interpretation expands upon existing guidance that addresses
when a company should include in its financial statements the assets and
liabilities of another entity. The primary objectives of FIN 46 are to provide
guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved
through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities
and to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the
variable interest entity the primary beneficiary. FIN 46 requires that both
the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable
interest make additional disclosures. In December2003, the FASB deliberated a
partial deferral of and certain proposed modifications to FIN 46 to address
certain implementation issues. The FASB decided that all of the proposed
modifications will be incorporated directly into a revised FIN 46 FIN 46-R,
rather than into a new interpretation that amends FIN 46. FIN 46-R will
incorporate much of the guidance previously issued in FIN 46. FIN 46 and FIN
46-R are effective by March15, 2004. The adoption of FIN 46 and FIN 46-R is
not expected to have a material impact on Registrants financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. 63 Table of Contents Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued SFAS No132 Revised, Employers Disclosures About Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits An Amendment of FASB Statements Nos. 87, 88, and 106
and a revision of FASB Statement No132: This statement revises employers
disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans. It
does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans. The new
disclosures were generally effective for 2003 calendar year-end financial
statements. Registrant has included the new disclosures in Note 9. Note 2 Regulatory Matters In accordance with accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises,
Registrant records regulatory assets, which represent probable future revenue
associated with certain costs that will be recovered from customers through the
rate-making process, and regulatory liabilities, which represent probable
future reductions in revenue associated with amounts that are to be credited to
customers through the rate-making process. Regulatory assets, less regulatory
liabilities, included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows

Supply Cost Balancing Accounts As permitted by the CPUC, SCW has historically maintained water supply
balancing accounts prior to November29, 2001 and electric supply balancing
accounts to account for under-collections and over-collections of revenues
designed to recover such costs. Costs are recorded in income and charged to
balancing accounts when such costs are incurred. The balancing accounts are
reversed when such costs are recovered through rate adjustments or through
refunds of previously incurred costs. SCW accrues interest on its supply cost
balancing accounts at the rate prevailing for 90-day commercial paper. CCWC
does not maintain a supply cost balancing account. Water Balancing Account On November29, 2001, the CPUC ordered water
utilities with existing water supply balancing accounts to cease booking
amounts to such accounts. In its place, water utilities are now required to
establish a memorandum supply cost account. The over- or under-collection of
water supply costs is recorded in this memorandum account in a manner similar
to the balancing account. The income statements of SCW will no longer include
entries reflecting differences between authorized water supply unit costs
included in rates and actual water supply costs. As a result, any changes in
water supply costs as well as any future authorized revenue increases for
supply expenses may directly impact earnings. 64 Table of Contents Note 2 Regulatory Matters Continued In a decision issued on June19, 2003 related to the memorandum supply
cost account, the CPUC concluded that iif a utility is within its 3-year
rate case cycle and does not earn in excess of its authorized rate of return,
the utility is entitled to recover its costs in the memorandum supply cost
account, subject to a reasonableness review by the CPUC; iiif a utility is
either within or outside of its rate case cycle and earns in excess of its
authorized rate-of-return, the utilitys recovery of expenses from the
memorandum supply cost account will be reduced by the amount exceeding the
authorized rate-of-return, and iiia utility is required to seek review of
under and over collections by filing an advice letter annually by March31.
Pursuant to the resolution, SCW filed advice letters on September12, 2003
seeking recovery of an under-collected balance of $26million for the period
November29, 2001 through December31, 2002. Upon receiving approval from the
CPUC, SCW will recognize the authorized under-collected amount as supply cost
balancing accounts on its books. As of December31, 2003, SCW has an
under-collection of approximately $55million in its memorandum supply cost
account, including the $26million filed with the CPUC. SCW intends to file
advice letters annually by March31. Amounts included in the memorandum supply
cost account are not capitalized until a rate order is received from the CPUC. With respect to pre-November29, 2001 water supply balancing accounts, SCW
has a net under-collection amount of $17million recorded at December31,
2003, the majority of which has been included in rates authorized on June19,
2003. Electric Balancing Account Electric power costs incurred by SCWs Bear
Valley Electric division continue to be charged to its electric supply cost
balancing account. The under-collection in the electric balancing account is
$227million at December31, 2003. The CPUC has authorized SCW to collect a
surcharge from its customers of 22 per kilowatt hour through August2011, to
enable SCW to recover the under-collection. SCW sold 132,849,639, 131,826,314
and 126,910,985 kilowatt hours of electricity to its Bear Valley Electric
division customers for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. SCW anticipates electricity sales to be sufficient during this
period for it to recover the amount of the under-collection. SCW is allowed to
include only up to a weighted annual energy purchase cost of $77 per MWh each
year through August2011 in its electric supply cost balancing account. To the
extent that actual weighted average annual cost for power purchased exceeds the
$77 per MWh amount, SCW will not be able to include these amounts in its
balancing account and such amounts will be expensed. During the years ended
December31, 2003 and 2002, approximately $240,000 and $718,000, respectively,
were expensed. CCWC, subject to regulation by the ACC, does not maintain balancing
accounts and increases in costs are normally expensed as incurred and recovered
through adjustments in general rate case applications. Costs Deferred for Future Recovery As discussed in Note 12, SCW sued Aerojet-General Corporation Aerojet
for causing the contamination of the Sacramento County Groundwater Basin
servicing SCW wells. On a related matter, SCW also filed a lawsuit against the
State of California. The CPUC authorized memorandum accounts to allow for
recovery, from customers, of costs incurred by SCW in prosecuting the cases
against Aerojet and the State, less any recovery from the defendants or others.
As of December31, 2003 and 2002, approximately $162million and $137
million, respectively, has been recorded as a non-yielding regulatory asset
representing primarily legal costs incurred to date in connection with
prosecuting the cases. At this time, management believes these costs are
recoverable either through rates or a settlement agreement with Aerojet, but
cannot give assurance that the CPUC will ultimately allow recovery of all or
any of these costs. Transmission Line Abandonment Costs The ability of SCW to deliver purchased power to customers in its Bear
Valley Electric service area is limited by the ability of the transmission
facilities owned by Southern California Edison Company Edison to transmit
this power. As more fully discussed in Note 11, SCW filed a lawsuit against
Edison in 2000 for breach of contract as a result of delays in upgrading these
transmission facilities as well as for other reasons. A settlement has been
reached between SCW and Edison, in which SCW is to pay a $5million project
abandonment fee to Edison. Edison will then file an application to the FERC
for approval of the entire $5million settlement payment as abandoned project
costs to be included in Edisons wholesale rate charged to SCW over a 15year
period which will be recovered through the supply cost balancing account.
Management believes that the FERCs approval of Edisons filing is probable and
the abandonment costs included in Edisons wholesale rate to SCW are
recoverable through rates. As a result, the $5million obligation to Edison
arising from the settlement was recorded as a regulatory asset during the
fourth quarter of 2003. 65 Table of Contents Note 2 Regulatory Matters Continued Asset Retirement Obligations As more fully discussed in Note 1, effective January1, 2003, Registrant
adopted SFAS No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Because
retirement costs have historically been recovered through rates at the time of
retirement, at implementation of SFAS No143, the cumulative effect has been
reflected as a regulatory asset. Registrant will also reflect the gain or loss
at settlement as a regulatory asset or liability on the balance sheet. Low Income Balancing Accounts This regulatory asset reflects primarily the costs of implementing the
California Alternate Rates for Water CARW program in SCWs Region II and
Region III to date. This program mandated by the CPUC provides a 15% discount
for qualified low-income individuals. The low income balancing account was
established in May2002 to track all the discounts and costs related to this
program for future recovery in rates. The Company anticipates the discounts for
low income families will eventually be incorporated in SCWs base rates to
customers. Refund of Water Right Lease Revenues In 1994, SCW entered into a contract to lease to the City of Folsom, 5,000
acre-feet per year of water rights to the American River, and has included all
associated revenues in a non-operating income account. The issue was raised by
the Office of Ratepayer Advocates ORA in SCWs Region III proceedings. In
a decision issued on March16, 2004, the CPUC determined that SCW failed to
seek the CPUCs approval to effectuate the lease and is to pay a fine of
$180,000. The decision also ordered SCW to refund 70percent of the total
amount of lease revenues received since 1994, plus interest, to customers.
Pursuant to the order, SCW recorded a $62million regulatory liability with a
corresponding charge against non-operating income less $25million of taxes
during the fourth quarter of 2003. Management disagrees with the CPUCs
decision and intends to file an appeal to the decision in which it will
vigorously defend its position. Revenues Subject to Refund Registrant recorded a $35million pre-tax charge to earnings in the
fourth quarter of 2003 to reflect a Proposed Decision issued by the CPUC. As
required by the Proposed Decision issued by the CPUC on December19, 2003, SCW
will be required to refund to customers approximately $35million in net
proceeds received from potentially responsible parties since 1998 for the
contamination of the Companys groundwater supply. Management believes the
refund is probable and as a result, SCW established a regulatory liability as
of December31, 2003. Changes in Rates Step increases of approximately $321,600 for four of seven ratemaking
districts in SCWs Region I were implemented in January2002. Region I also
received attrition increases of $219,400 effective January2003. On January16, 2003, the CPUC approved rate increases of approximately
$27million annually, effective January22, 2003, in SCWs Metropolitan
district to recover costs associated with an increase in Region II rate base
associated with SCWs 2002 infrastructure replacement program and,
additionally, to recover general increases in operating expenses. On January
31, 2003, the CPUC also approved SCWs Advice Letter filed for the Region II
2003 infrastructure replacement program with rate increases of $35million
annually, effective February4, 2003. 66 Table of Contents Note 2 Regulatory Matters Continued On August17, 2001, SCW filed an application with the CPUC seeking
recovery of an average cost of $87 per megawatt hour MWh for electric energy
purchased pursuant to power purchase contracts with Mirant Marketing and PWCC.
On July17, 2002, CPUC approved a settlement agreement reached among SCW, all
intervening parties and the Office of Ratepayer Advocates. As discussed
earlier, the authorization permits SCW to recover $77 per MWh of purchased
power costs through rates. SCW is allowed to include its actual purchased power
costs up to an average annual weighted cost of $77 per MWh each year, through
August2011, in its balancing account. To the extent SCWs actual average
annual weighted cost for purchased power is less than $77 per MWh, the
differential would offset amounts included in the electric supply balancing
account. Conversely, to the extent that actual average annual weighted costs
for power purchased exceed the $77 per MWh amount, SCW would not be able to
include these amounts in its balancing account and such amounts would be
expensed against income. In October2002, SCW filed an application to increase water rates in the
customer service areas that comprise Region III. SCW also filed a concurrent
application requesting a rate increase applicable to SCWs entire customer base
to recover costs associated with the general office functions of SCW. On March
16, 2004, the CPUC issued its decision under which the new approved water rates
will generate an initial annual increase in revenues of approximately $89
million. Note 3 Utility Plant The

Note 4 - Capital Stock During the 2003 Annual Meeting of shareholders held on May20, 2003,
shareholders approved the elimination of all references to stated value in the
Companys Articles of Incorporation. As a result, a reclassification
adjustment of $1016million was made that eliminated Registrants additional
paid-in capital. All Preferred Shares, including the 4%, 41/4% and 5% Series, were fully
redeemed at the option of AWR during 2002. At December31, 2003 and 2002, there
were no Preferred Shares outstanding. The redemption price per share for each
series of $25 Preferred Shares was $2700, $2650 and $2525 for the 4 41/4% and 5% Series, respectively, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the
redemption date. 67 Table of Contents Note 4 - Capital Stock Continued On June7, 2002, Registrant completed a 3-for-2 stock split of Common
Shares for the holders of record on May15, 2002. Earnings per share and number
of shares have been retroactively restated for all periods presented to reflect
the stock split. AWR has a Registration Statement on file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for issuance, from time to time, of up to $60million in aggregate
in Common Shares, Preferred Shares and/or debt securities. As of December31,
2003, approximately $31,080,000 remained for issuance under this Registration
Statement. During the year ended December31, 2003, Registrant issued 14,295 and
14,735 Common Shares under the Registrants Common Share Purchase and Dividend
Reinvestment Plan DRPand 401k Plan, respectively. There are 695,084 and
49,171 Common Shares authorized but unissued under the DRP and the 401k Plan,
respectively, at December31, 2003. Shares reserved for the 401k Plan are in
relation to Company matching contributions and for investment purposes by
participants. During the year ended December31, 2002, Registrant issued 30,180
and 31,211 Common Shares under the Registrants DRP and 401k Plan,
respectively. For the year ended December31, 2001, all shares issued under
Registrants DRP and the 401k Plan were purchased on the open market. In 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan Rights
Plan and authorized a dividend distribution of one right a Right to purchase
1/1000th of Junior Participating Preferred Share for each outstanding Common
Share. The Rights Plan became effective in September1998 and will expire in
September2008. The Rights Plan is designed to provide shareholders protection
and to maximize shareholder value by encouraging a prospective acquirer to
negotiate with the Board of Directors. Each
Right represents a right to purchase 1/1000th of Junior Participating
Preferred Share at the price of $120, subject to adjustment the Purchase
Price. Each Junior Participating Preferred Share is entitled to receive a
dividend equal to 1000 times any dividend paid on each Common Share and 100
votes per share in any shareholder election. The Rights become exercisable upon
occurrence of a Distribution Date event. A Distribution Date event occurs if
iany person accumulates 15% of the then outstanding Common Shares, iiany
person presents a tender offer which caused the persons ownership level to
exceed 15% and the board determines the tender offer not to be fair to AWRs
shareholders, or iiithe board determines that a shareholder maintaining a
15% interest in the Common Shares could have an adverse impact on AWR or could
attempt to pressure AWR to repurchase the holders shares at a premium. Until the occurrence of a Distribution Date, each Right trades with the
Common Share and is not separately transferable. When a Distribution Date
occurs, AWR would distribute separately Rights Certificates to Common
Shareholders. The Rights would subsequently trade separately from the Common
Shares and each holder of a Right, other than the acquiring person whose Rights
will thereafter be void, will have the right to receive upon exercise at its
then current Purchase Price that number of Common Shares having a market value
of two times the Purchase Price of the Right. If AWR merges into the acquiring
person or enters into any transaction that unfairly favors the acquiring person
or disfavors AWRs other shareholders, the Right becomes a right to purchase
Common Shares of the acquiring person having a market value of two times the
Purchase Price. The Board of Directors may determine that, in certain circumstances, a
proposal, which would cause a distribution of the Rights, is in the best
interest of AWRs shareholders. Therefore, the Board of Directors may, at its
option, redeem the Rights at a redemption price of $001 per Right. Note 5 Dividend Limitations On February3, 2004, AWR declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0221
per common share. The dividend, totaling approximately $34million, was paid
on March1, 2004 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on
February9, 2004. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, AWR paid quarterly dividends to the
shareholders, totaling approximately $134million or $0884 per share, $132
million or $0872 per share, and $131million or $0867 per share,
respectively. AWRs ability to pay cash dividends on common stock outstanding
depends primarily upon cash flows from its SCW subsidiary. 68 Table of Contents Note 5 Dividend Limitations SCW is subject to contractual restrictions on its ability to pay
dividends. SCWs maximum ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain Note
Agreements to the sum of $21million plus 100% of consolidated net income plus
the aggregate net cash proceeds received from capital stock offerings or other
instruments convertible into capital stock from various dates. Under the most
restrictive of the Note Agreements, $1549million was available to pay
dividends to AWR as of December31, 2003. Dividends in the amount of
$15,400,000, $14,630,000 and $13,530,000, were paid to AWR by SCW in 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively. The ability of AWR, ASUS and SCW to pay dividends is also restricted by
California law. Under restrictions of the California tests, approximately $848
million of retained earnings for AWR was available to pay dividends to Common
Shareholders at December31, 2003. Approximately $827million was available
from the retained earnings of SCW to pay dividends to AWR. At December31,
2003, ASUS was not allowed to pay dividends to AWR under the California tests. CCWC is subject to contractual restrictions on its ability to pay
dividends. CCWCs maximum ability to distribute dividends is limited to the
maintenance of no more than 55% debt in the capital structure for the quarter
immediately preceding the distribution. The ability of CCWC to pay dividends is
also restricted by Arizona law. Under restrictions of the Arizona tests,
approximately $44million was available to pay dividends to AWR at December
31, 2003. Dividends in an amount of $1,003,000 were paid to AWR in 2001 by
CCWC. There were no dividends distributed from CCWC to AWR in 2003 or 2002. Note 6 - Bank Debt AWR paid off a $25million non-revolving credit facility on January2,
2002. In June2002, AWR established a new $75million syndicated credit
facility. Under the terms of this facility, either AWR or SCW may obtain
letters of credit for up to an aggregate of $15million. At December31, 2003 56million in cash borrowings was outstanding under this facility, $19million
of which was used to fund AWRs activities, $34million was used to fund SCWs
operations and is included in inter-company payables on SCWs balance sheets as
of December31, 2003, and $30million was used to fund ASUS activities.
Additionally, SCW has obtained letters of credit, in the amount of $7,481,000
in aggregate, including 1a letter of credit with a fee of 0625%, which
expires February6, 2005, in the amount of $6,296,000 to a trustee with respect
to the variable rate obligation issued by the Three Valleys Municipal Water
District, 2a letter of credit with an annual fee of 0625%, which expires on
October1, 2004, in the amount of $600,000 as security for the deductible in
the Companys business automobile insurance policy, and 3a letter of credit
with a fee of 0625%, which expires March31, 2005 in an amount, which varies
from $270,000 to $585,000 during the year as security for the purchase of
power. There were no compensating balances required. Loans can be obtained at
the option of Registrant and bear interest at rates based on credit ratings and

There were no short-term borrowing activities at CCWC. 69 Table of Contents Note 7 Long-Term Debt Registrants long-term debt consists primarily of Notes and Debentures.
The Company summarizes its long-term debt in the Statements of Capitalization.
No new long-term debt was issued in 2003 and 2002. In October2003, the 582%
Notes totaling $12,500,000 matured. Proceeds from short-term bank borrowings
were used to repay the Notes. SCW has no mortgage debt, and leases and other
similar financial arrangements are not material. Redemption of certain of the
long-term debt issues outstanding as of December31, 2003 and 2002 can be made
in whole or in part at the option of SCW subject to redemption schedules
embedded in the agreements particular to each issue. With the exception of the
956% Notes, the redemption premiums in effect for 2003 range up to 7% of par
value. The 956% Notes are subject to a make-whole premium based on 55 basis
points above the applicable Treasury Yield if redeemed prior to 2021. After
2021, the maximum redemption premium is 3% of par value. CCWC has long-term Industrial Development Authority Bonds IDA Bonds and
a repayment contract due 2006. Substantially all of the utility plant of CCWC
is pledged as collateral for its IDA Bonds. The Bond Agreement, among other
things, irequires CCWC to maintain certain financial ratios, iirestricts
CCWCs ability to incur additional debt, make liens, sell, lease or dispose of
assets, merge with another corporation, and pay dividends, and iiirequires
CCWC to establish a debt service reserve fund held in trust for future
payments, which totaled $655,760 and $658,774 as of December31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. AWR

SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, for certain transactions which are
recognized for income tax purposes in a period different from that in which
they are reported in the financial statements. The most significant items are
the tax effects of accelerated depreciation, the supply cost balancing accounts
and advances for, and contributions-in-aid-of-, construction. SFAS No109 also
requires that rate-regulated enterprises record deferred income taxes for
temporary differences accorded flow-through treatment at the direction of a
regulatory commission. The resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recorded at the expected cash flow to be reflected in future rates. Given that
the CPUC has consistently permitted the recovery of flowed-through tax effects,
SCW has established regulatory liabilities and assets offsetting such deferred
tax assets and liabilities Note 2. Deferred investment tax credits are
amortized ratably to the nonoperating deferred tax provision over the lives of
the property giving rise to the credits. The significant components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as
reflected in the balance sheets at December31, 2003 and 2002 were

72 Table of Contents Note 9 - Employee Benefit Plans Pension and Postretirement Plans Registrant maintains a pension plan the Plan that provides eligible
employees those aged 21 and older, with one year of service monthly benefits
upon retirement based on average salaries and length of service. The normal
retirement benefit is equal to 2% of the five highest consecutive years average
earnings multiplied by the number of years of credited service, up to a maximum
of 40years, reduced by a percentage of primary social security benefits. There
is also an early retirement option; however, for terminations on or after
January1, 2004, the early retirement provisions changed increasing benefits
under the Plan for employees who retire prior to age 65. The eligibility
requirements for early retirement are age 55 and 5years of vesting service.
This Plan amendment is expected to increase Registrants annual pension cost by
approximately 5%. Annual contributions are made to the Plan, which comply with
the funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
ERISA. Registrant also provides all active employees medical, dental and vision
care benefits through a medical insurance plan Other Postretirement
Benefits. Eligible employees, who retired prior to age 65, and/or their
spouses, were able to retain the benefits under the active plan until reaching
age 65. Eligible employees upon reaching age 65, and those employees retiring
at or after age 65, and/or their spouses, receive coverage through a Medicare
supplement insurance policy paid for by Registrant subject to an annual cap
limit. Registrants postretirement medical plan does not provide prescription
drug benefits to Medicare-eligible employees and is not affected by the
Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. The CPUC issued a decision, which provides for the recovery in rates of
tax-deductible contributions made to a separate trust fund. In accordance with
that decision, Registrant established two separate trusts in 1995, one for
those retirees who were subject to a collective bargaining agreement and
another for all other retirees. Registrants funding policy is to contribute
annually an amount at least equal to the revenues authorized to be collected
through rates for postretirement benefit costs. Postretirement benefit costs
for 1993, 1994 and 1995 were estimated at a total of $16million and have been
recorded as a regulatory asset for recovery over a 20-year period. The
unamortized balance at December31, 2003 and 2002 was $324,852 and $386,676,
respectively. At December31, 2003, Registrant had 782 participants in the Plan, 73 of
these are employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. One collective
bargaining agreement expires in 2004 and one should have expired in 2002, but
has been extended by mutual consent of the parties involved until a new
contract is ratified. At December31, 2003, the accumulated benefit obligation of the Plan
exceeded the related plan assets at the measurement date. In accordance with
accounting standards, Registrants balance sheets include an additional minimum
liability, with a corresponding charge to an intangible asset. The following
table sets forth the Plans funded status and amounts recognized in
Registrants balance sheets and the components of net pension cost and accrued
postretirement liability at December31, 2003 and 2002 73 Table of Contents Note 9 - Employee Benefit Plans Continued

70% for union plan, 42% for non-union, net of income taxes in 2003,
and 80% in 2002 and 2001 A sliding scale for assumed health care cost increases was used for the
periods presented. In 2003 and 2002, health care cost increases started at
120% grading down to 50% in 10years for those under age 65, and at 140%
grading down to 45% in 10years for post 65. In 2001, health care cost
increases started at 85% then graded down percentage point each year to
the ultimate rate of 5% after 6years. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the
amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in

Determination of the Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Assets To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for
the pension plan, Registrant considered the historical returns and the future
expectations for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset
allocation of the pension portfolio. This resulted in the selection of the
70% long-term rate of return on assets assumption. Registrants policy is to fund the medical benefit trusts based on
actuarially determined amounts as allowed in rates. Registrant may invest such
funds in qualified instruments to achieve the desired return objective and
minimize recovery through rates. During 2004, the Registrant intends to invest
the funds in the postretirement trusts that will achieve a desired return and
minimize amounts necessary to recover through rates. The mix is expected to
provide for a return on asset similar to the pension plan and to achieve
Registrants targeted allocation. This resulted in the selection of the 7%
long-term rate of return on assets assumption. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan Registrant has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP that
provides additional retirement benefits to certain key employees and officers
of the Company by making up benefits, which are limited by Sections415 and
401a17 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As of December
31, 2003 and 2002, the benefits are unfunded. During 2003, amendments affecting the SERP were approved which increased
the related benefit obligation. The increase was primarily due to an amendment
related to a change in the early retirement provisions. At December31, 2003,
the accumulated benefit obligation of the SERP exceeded the related plan assets
at the measurement date. In accordance with accounting standards, Registrants
balance sheets include an additional minimum liability, with a corresponding
charge to an intangible asset. The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, funded
status of the SERP, as well as a summary of significant estimates at December

401k Investment Incentive Program Registrant has a 401k Investment Incentive Program under which employees
may invest a percentage of their pay, up to a maximum investment prescribed by
law, in an investment program managed by an outside investment manager. Company
contributions to the 401k are based upon a percentage of individual employee
contributions and, for 2003, 2002 and 2001, totaled $1,031,793, $975,687 and
$953,938, respectively. Directors Plan Registrant has a Retirement Plan for Non-Employee Directors. This
Non-Employee Directors Plan provides annual benefits to an eligible director in
an amount equal to the annual retainer in effect at the directors date of
retirement. Benefits are payable in monthly installments for a period equal to
the shortest of athe period he or she was a director or b10years.
Benefits are payable to directors after the age of 62 and after retirement from
the Board. As of December31, 2003, liability recorded for this plan totaled
$530,500. 77 Table of Contents Note 10 Stock Compensation Plan Registrant established a 2000 Stock Incentive Plan the 2000 Plan
adopted at the Shareholders Annual Meeting in 2000 to provide stock-based
incentives as a means of promoting the success of the Company by attracting,
retaining and aligning the interests of employees with those of shareholders
generally. There are 750,000 Common Shares reserved for issuance under the 2000
Plan. All stock options are granted at the fair market value of the underlying
stock on the date of the grant, accordingly, no compensation expense was
recognized during the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. The fair
value of stock options used to compute pro forma net income and earnings per
share disclosures discussed in Note 1, is the estimated fair value at grant
date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following

One-third of the stock options granted become exercisable on each of the
first three anniversaries of the grant date, but may be exercised earlier if
there is a change in control of the Company. The stock options generally expire
ten years from the date of grant. Weighted average remaining contractual life
at December31, 2003 is 797years. Exercise prices of options outstanding at
December31, 2003 ranged from $2083 to $2343 per share. 78 Table of Contents Note 11 - Business Risks and Commitments Registrants utility operations are engaged in supplying water and
electric service to the public. Registrant is required to provide service and
grant credit to customers within its defined service areas. Although Registrant
has a diversified base of residential, industrial and other customers, revenues
derived from commercial and residential water customers accounted for
approximately 91% of total water revenues in 2003, which is about the same
percentage as in 2002 and 2001. Registrant faces additional risks associated
with weather conditions, adequacy and quality of water supplies, regulatory
decisions, pronouncements and laws, water-related litigation, and general
business conditions. Cooler and wetter weather conditions experienced in 2003
in most of SCWs service areas as compared to 2002 resulted in a decrease in
water demand. SCWs Water Supply During 2003, approximately 432% of SCWs water supply was purchased from
wholesalers of imported water, with the remainder produced from Company wells.
The long-term availability of imported water supplies is dependent upon, among
other things, drought conditions throughout the state of California, increases
in population, water quality standards, legislation that may potentially reduce
water supplies and issues related to Californias allocation of Colorado River
water. Reservoir storage in California statewide stood at 100% of normal in
February of 2004. CCWCs Water Supply Arizonas precipitation levels for the 2003 water year were between 70%
and 89% of normal with the Colorado River area getting 82%. However this was a
marked improvement over 2002 when precipitation was almost nonexistent. The
Colorado River basin continues to experience drought conditions with
precipitation at 32% of normal. Lake Powell and Lake Mead storage levels are
currently at 68% of average. So far this water year inflow to Lake Powell has
been 1,366,200 acre feet with outflow at 1,254,500 acre feet which is 72% of
average. The April-July inflow to Lake Powell is forecast to be 6,800,000 acre
feet, which is 86% of normal. Snowpack above Lake Powell is 95% of average. The Arizona Water Banking Authority AWBAwas created to store Arizonas
unused Colorado River water entitlement in western, central and southern
Arizona to develop long-term storage credits to: ifirm existing water
supplies for municipal and industrial users during Colorado River shortages or
Central Arizona Project CAPservice interruptions; iihelp meet the water
management objectives of the Arizona Groundwater Code; and iiiassist in the
settlement of American Indian water rights claims. The ABWA successfully
recharged more than 209,000 acre-feet in 2003 allowing for the second year in a
row for Arizona to use its full allocation of Colorado River entitlement of 28
million acre-feet. This banked water can be used as a hedge against future
drought conditions. Further, the first curtailment of CAP deliveries in the
event of shortage would occur to non-Indian agricultural users. Such users
accounted for a third of CAP deliveries in 2003, creating a buffer for users
such as CCWC. Though it is difficult to predict drought conditions with
certainty, the activities of AWBA, and the priority for users of CAP, such as
CCWC, provides an improved outlook for CCWC supplies. CCWC obtains its water supply from two operating wells and from Colorado
River water delivered by the CAP. The majority of CCWCs water supply is
obtained from its CAP allocation and well water is used for peaking capacity in
excess of treatment plant capability, during treatment plant shutdown, and to
keep the well system in optimal operating condition. CCWC has an Assured Water Supply designation, by decision and order of the
Arizona Department of Water Resources ADWR, providing in part that, subject
to its requirements, CCWC has a sufficient supply of ground water and CAP water
which is physically, continuously and legally available to satisfy current and
committed demands of its customers, plus at least two years of predicted
demands, for 100years. CCWC has, however, received a letter from the ADWR stating that the
current and committed demand for water in CCWCs service area has exceeded
CCWCs supply of water in its proven assured water supply account by 400
acre-feet per year. ADWRs letter requires CCWC to make up this accounting
deficit by securing additional water supplies and/or providing information to
ADWR that would allow ADWR to issue a new decision that CCWCs current and
committed demands are within the proven available supplies in CCWCs assured
water supply account. 79 Table of Contents Note 11 - Business Risks and Commitments Continued The ADWR letter is part of a routine administrative review of all water
providers. ADWRs review will have no impact on CCWCs ability to deliver
water to its existing customers. CCWC has submitted an application to the ADWR
to modify its designation of assured supply on February11, 2004. If there
are no objections to the application to modify CCWCs designation of assured
supply by ADWR, they may proceed to modify CCWCs designation, subject to CCWC
obtaining membership in the Central Arizona Groundwater Replenishment District. Notwithstanding an assured water supply designation, CCWCs water supply
may be subject to interruption or reduction, in particular owing to
interruption or reduction of CAP water. In the event of interruption or
reduction of CAP water, CCWC can currently rely on its well water supplies for
short-term periods. However, in any event, the quantity of water CCWC supplies
to some or all of its customers may be interrupted or curtailed, pursuant to
the provisions of its tariffs. CCWC has the physical capability to deliver
water in excess of that which is currently accounted for in CCWCs assured
water supply account. MCO Properties, Inc. MCO, a real estate developer and former owners of
CCWC, has filed a complaint against AWR and CCWC in the Superior Court of
Maricopa County on June6, 2003 alleging breach of contract, breach of implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, interference with prospective economic
advantage, negligence and negligent misrepresentation and seeking a declaratory
judgment. The complaint arises out of allegations by MCO that AWR has failed to
comply with the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement between AWR and MCO
pursuant to which AWR acquired CCWC from MCO and has thereby interfered with
MCOs ability to develop its real property in the Town of Fountain Hills. A
revised complaint was filed on December12, 2003 further alleging that CCWC did
not maintain its designation of assured water supply as required in the Stock
Purchase Agreement. Similar allegations have been filed by MCO against CCWC
with the Arizona Corporation Commission. There have been settlement discussions
seeking to resolve these issues Note 12. In addition, to the actions described above with respect to CCWCs assured
water supply designation, ADWR and CCWC have agreed that the Town of Fountain
Hills may approve and record final parcel plats for subdivisions for which CCWC
has entered into written commitments to provide water service, conditional on
iADWR sending a notification to the Town that ADWR has approved a
modification to CCWCs designation or otherwise has determined that CCWC has
enough water for current and committed demands including the subdivision, and
iiMCO not submitting a request to the State Real Estate Commissioner for a
public report for the subdivision in advance of ADWRs issuance of the
notification to the Town. Bear Valley Electric All electric energy sold by SCW to customers in its Bear Valley Electric
customer service area is purchased from others. In March2001, SCW entered into
a five-year nine-month, block forward purchase contract with Mirant Marketing
to supply its Bear Valley Electric customer service area with 15 MWs of
electric energy at a price of $95 per MWh beginning April1, 2001 through
December31, 2006. SCW has filed a complaint with the FERC seeking to reduce
the rates in the Mirant Marketing contract to a just and reasonable price. On
December19, 2002 the FERC issued an initial decision denying SCWs complaint.
SCW has appealed the initial decision but anticipates that it is unlikely that
FERC will grant its request to reduce these charges. In June2003, the FERC
issued a final order denying SCWs complaint. On November10, 2003, the FERC
denied SCWs rehearing request. SCW is currently reviewing its options with
respect to the FERCs latest order denying rehearing and is determining if it
will appeal the decision in Federal Court. In June2001, SCW also executed a
three-year, block forward purchase agreement with PWCC for an additional 8 MWs
of electric energy to meet Bear Valley Electrics peak winter demands at a
price of $75 per MWh for the first year, $48 per MWh for the second year and
$36 per MWh for the third year. Effective November2002, SCW entered into a series of purchase power
contracts with PWCC. Under the agreements, SCW will exchange 15 MWs of electric
energy with PWCC at $7465 per MWh that results in an upfront payment of $2035
per MWh for 15 MWs over the period beginning November1, 2002 through December
31, 2006. This upfront payment is being recorded as a reduction of purchased
power costs which are included in the supply cost balancing account. In
addition, 8 MWs of electric energy are also being sold to PWCC at the prices
set forth in the June2001 energy purchase agreement with PWCC, and 8 MWs are
being purchased at $7465 per MWh beginning on November1, 2002 through March
31, 2003 and each succeeding November 1 through March31 through March31, 2008
and for the period November1, 2008 through December31, 2008. Total
commitments under these agreements amount to $719million with $12million due
each year through December31, 2008. 80 Table of Contents Note 11 - Business Risks and Commitments Continued The average minimum load at SCWs Bear Valley Electric customer service
area has been approximately 14 MWs. The average winter load has been 18 MWs
with a winter peak of 39 MWs when the snowmaking machines at the ski resorts
are operating. On July17, 2002, the CPUC approved a settlement agreement reached among
SCW, all intervening parties and the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, which
permits SCW to recover $77 per MWh of purchased power costs through rates,
effective immediately thereafter. SCW will only be allowed to include up to a
weighted annual energy purchase cost of $77 per MWh each year through August
2011,in its balancing account. To the extent SCWs actual average annual
weighted cost for purchased power is less than $77 per MWh, the differential
will recover amounts included in the electric supply balancing account.
Conversely, to the extent that actual average annual weighted costs for power
purchased exceed the $77 per MWh amount, SCW will not be able to include these
amounts in its balancing account and such amounts will be expensed. In 2003 and
2002, approximately $02million and $07million, respectively, was expensed.
As a result of the settlement, SCW is also permitted to collect a surcharge of
22 per kilowatt hour from its customers for up to ten years commencing August
2001 to allow SCW an opportunity to collect amounts remaining in its electric
cost balancing account, with interest, incurred by SCW during the energy crisis
in 2000-2001. Demand for energy in SCWs Bear Valley Electric customer service area
generally has been increasing. However, the ability of SCW to deliver purchased
power to these customers is limited by the ability of the transmission
facilities owned by Southern California Edison Company to transmit this power.
As a means of meeting these increasing demands for energy, SCW is constructing
a natural gas-fueled 84 MW generation facility to be owned by SCW. A
Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity filed with the CPUC seeking
authorization for construction of the generation facility was approved on July
10, 2003. It is expected that the generator will be on line during the second
quarter of 2004, and should assist SCW in controlling its spot purchase prices. SCW has been, in conjunction with Edison, planning to upgrade transmission
facilities to 115kv the 115kv Project in order to meet increased energy and
demand requirements for SCWs Bear Valley Electric Service area. On December
27, 2000, SCW filed a lawsuit against Edison for declaratory relief and seeking
damages for breach of contract as a result of delays in the 115kv Project,
violations of good faith and fair dealing, negligent misrepresentation,
intentional misrepresentation and unjust enrichment. Subsequently Edison filed
a cross-complaint against SCW for breach of contract, anticipatory breach, and
quantum meruit. SCW has also sought declaratory relief from Edisons claims. To
date, SCW has spent approximately $34million in this matter, all of which has
been expensed. A settlement has been reached between SCW and Edison, in which
iSCW is to pay Edison $50million as the cost of abandoning and terminating
the 115kv Project, iiEdison shall make a filing the FERC to include the cost
into a FERC rate schedule under the Transmission Service Agreement between SCW
and Edison, and iiiEdison is to sell the Goldhill substation and associated
transmission line to SCW at its book value. Management believes that the
FERCs approval on Edisons filing is probable and this cost is within the
meaning of the CPUCs Code of Abandonment Fee which is recoverable through
the supply cost balancing account. As a result, the $50million obligation to
Edison arising from this settlement was recorded as a liability with a
corresponding amount to a regulatory asset in the fourth quarter of 2003. A
final settlement agreement was reached on March17, 2004. Operating Leases Registrant leases equipment and facilities primarily for its Regional and
District offices under non-cancelable operating leases with varying terms,
provisions, and expiration dates. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, Registrants
consolidated rent expense was $2,187,008, $1,992,889 and $1,893,337,
respectively. Registrants future minimum payments under long-term
non-cancelable operating leases at December31, 2003 are as follows

There is no material difference between the consolidated operations of AWR
and the operations of SCW in regards to the future minimum payments under
long-term non-cancelable operating leases. 81 Table of Contents Note 12 - Contingencies Water Quality-Related Litigation SCW has been named as a defendant in twenty-two lawsuits that allege that
SCW and other water utilities, delivered unsafe water to their customers.
Plaintiffs in these actions seek damages, including general, special, and
punitive damages, according to proof at trial, as well as attorneys fees on
certain causes of action, costs of suit, and other unspecified relief. Nineteen
of the lawsuits involve customer service areas located in Los Angeles County in
the southern portion of California; three of the lawsuits involve a customer
service area located in Sacramento County in northern California. On September
1, 1999, the Court of Appeal in San Francisco held that the CPUC had preemptive
jurisdiction over regulated public utilities and ordered dismissal of a series
of these lawsuits. On October11, 1999, one group of plaintiffs appealed the
decision to the California Supreme Court. On February4, 2002, the California Supreme Court concluded that ithe
CPUC had preemptive jurisdiction over claims seeking injunctive relief and
claims based on the theory that a public utility regulated by the CPUC provided
unsafe drinking water even though it had complied with federal and state
drinking water standards, but iithe CPUC did not have preemptive
jurisdiction over damage claims alleging violations of federal and state
drinking water standards by public utilities regulated by the CPUC. As a
result, damage claims based on allegations of violations of federal and state
drinking water standards may proceed while the other claims must be dismissed.
In light of the breadth of plaintiffs claims, the lack of factual information
regarding plaintiffs claims and injuries, if any, the impact of the California
Supreme Court decision on plaintiffs claims and the fact that no discovery has
yet been completed, SCW is unable at this time to determine what, if any,
potential liability it may have with respect to claims based on allegations of
violation of federal and state drinking water standards. Based upon the
information currently available to it, Registrant believes that these claims
are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against these claims. SCW is subject to self-insured retention provisions in its applicable
insurance policies and has either expensed the self-insured amounts or has
reserved against payment of these amounts as appropriate. SCWs various
insurance carriers have, to date, provided reimbursement for costs incurred
above the self-insured amounts for defense against these lawsuits, subject to a
reservation of rights. In addition, on March16, 2004, the CPUC issued a
decision which authorizes SCW to establish a memorandum account to accumulate
costs to comply with certain contamination remediation requirements for future
recovery. Based on the decision, SCW reversed $10million of water quality
related reserves into income during the fourth quarter of 2003. Order Instituting Investigation OII In March1998, the CPUC issued an OII to regulated water utilities in the
state of California, including SCW. The purpose of the OII was to determine
whether existing standards and policies regarding drinking water quality
adequately protect the public health and whether those standards and policies
were being uniformly complied with by those water utilities. On November2,
2000, a final decision from the CPUC concluded that the CPUC has the
jurisdiction to regulate the service of water utilities with respect to the
health and safety of that service; that the California Department of Health
Services requirements governing drinking water quality adequately protect the
public health and safety; and that, based on an extensive review of 25years of
water quality records, regulated water utilities, including SCW, have
satisfactorily complied with past and present drinking water quality
requirements, except for one small unrelated water utility in Northern
California. The CPUC had previously authorized establishment of memorandum accounts to
capture expenses related to the OII. Under the memorandum account procedure,
SCW may recover litigation costs from ratepayers to the extent authorized by
the CPUC. As of December31, 2003 and 2002, SCW had incurred a net cost of
$890,000 related to the OII for which it had established a reserve in prior
years due to uncertainty of recoverability. In a decision issued by the CPUC
on March16, 2004 on SCWs filing for its Region III and general office
functions, SCW is now allowed to recover these cost through a special condition
surcharge over a twelve-month period. Based on the decision, SCW reversed the
$890,000 OII reserve into income during the fourth quarter of 2003. 82 Table of Contents Note 12 Contingencies Continued Other Water Quality Litigation On October25, 1999, SCW filed a lawsuit against the State of California
and its State Water Resources Control Board, Central Valley Regional Water
Quality Control Board, and Department of Toxic Substances Control
collectively, the State alleging that the State had substantially
participated in a project to inject chemical pollution into portions of the
Sacramento County groundwater basin and that pollution is progressively
destroying the groundwater supply in SCWs Rancho Cordova water system. SCW and
the State have entered into a comprehensive $2,475,000 settlement for all of
SCWs claims against the State, contingent upon the courts approval of the
good faith of the settlement, which SCW received in full during the third
quarter of 2003. In a separate case, also filed on October25, 1999, SCW sued
Aerojet-General Corporation Aerojet for causing the contamination of eastern
portions of the Sacramento County groundwater basin. A cross complaint filed by
Aerojet against SCW for negligence and constituting a public nuisance was
voluntarily dismissed by Aerojet in October2002. On October10, 2003,
Registrant entered into a confidential Memorandum of Understanding MOU with
the Aerojet-General subsidiary of GenCorp, Inc. for the settlement of legal
actions brought by SCW. The MOU sets forth the present financial terms and the
structure of a settlement to cover, over time, capital and litigation related
costs incurred by SCW resulting from the contamination. The MOU and the
settlement embodied therein was found to be binding by the Sacramento Superior
Court on January18, 2004. Further documentation incorporating the terms of
the MOU is presently underway. However, documentation is not complete and
management is presently unable to predict when a comprehensive set of
settlement documents will be completed. Based on the financial terms in the MOU, SCW established a receivable from
Aerojet in an amount of $167million at the end of 2003, of which $87million
has been received in early 2004 and is included in current Other Accounts
Receivable on the balance sheets. The remainder of the costs is subject to
further settlement documentation. Reimbursements received from Aerojet have
been applied directly to reduce SCWs costs of utility plant and purchased
water. Prior to the MOU, Aerojet had reimbursed SCW $43million in capital
costs and $171,000 for additional water supply. In an action related to the draft settlement agreement, Registrant and
Aerojet have signed three separate agreements requiring Aerojet to pay for
certain infrastructure and upgrades to the Coloma Treatment Plant as a
contingency plan should additional wells be impacted prior to the high summer
demand period of 2004. The value of the three agreements approximates $68
million in capital improvements. In addition, SCW is in negotiations with the
County of Sacramento regarding a replacement of water supply. The CPUC has previously authorized memorandum accounts to allow for
recovery, from customers, of costs incurred by SCW in prosecuting the suits
filed against the State and Aerojet, less any recovery from the defendants or
others. As of December31, 2003, approximately $162million in legal and
consulting related costs has been recorded as deferred charges and included in
Regulatory Assets on the balance sheets. The CPUC has authorized SCW to
increase rates, effective April28, 2001, for recovery over a six-year period
of approximately $18million, in expenses that were incurred on or before
August31, 2000, in the Aerojet matter recorded as a regulatory asset Note 2.
As part of an abbreviated application for SCWs Region I, SCW requested a
long-term amortization of the balance of costs included in the Aerojet
litigation memorandum account, net of any reimbursement amount. The draft
agreement also addresses the possible recovery of SCWs deferred charges
through revenues in new development areas. Management believes these costs are
recoverable either through rates or the settlement agreement with Aerojet. It
is managements intention to offset any settlement that may occur from these
actions against the balance in the memorandum accounts at the time of
settlement. 83 Table of Contents Note 12 Contingencies Continued The compound MTBE has been detected in a well serving SCWs Los Osos water
system. For some time, SCW has been working with the Regional Water Quality
Control Board as well as the owner of a service station. Although the owner of
the service station has attempted remediation with funds provided through the
California Underground Storage Tank Fund CUSTF, it appears there will be
insufficient funds from the CUSTF to complete remediation sufficient to return
the well to service. In order to prevent the running of the statute of
limitations, on August12, 2002 SCW filed suit in the Superior Court of the
State of California for the County of San Luis Obispo against the operators and
owners of the service station facility, and Chevron USA Products, Inc., the
supplier. A settlement with Chevron has been reached and a filing has been made
for dismissal by the Court. The impacted well may need to be removed
permanently from service and the settlement with Chevron is expected to afford
SCW sufficient funds to commence site development and construction of a
replacement well. Perchlorate and/or Volatile Organic Compounds VOChave been detected in
five wells servicing SCWs San Gabriel System. SCW filed suit, along with two
other affected water purveyors and the San Gabriel Basin Water Quality
Authority WQA, in the federal court against some of those responsible for the
contamination. Some of the other potential defendants settled with SCW, other
water purveyors and the WQA on VOC related issues prior to the filing of the
lawsuit. In response to the filing of the Federal lawsuit, the Potentially
Responsible Party PRPdefendants filed motions to dismiss the suit or strike
certain portions of the suit. The judge issued a ruling on April1, 2003
granting in part and denying in part the defendants motions. A key ruling of
the court was that the water purveyors, including the Registrant, by virtue of
their ownership of wells contaminated with hazardous chemicals are themselves
PRPs under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act CERCLA. Registrant has, pursuant to permission of the court,
amended its suit to claim certain affirmative defenses as an innocent party
under CERCLA. Registrant is presently unable to predict the outcome of this
ruling on its ability to fully recover from the PRPs future costs associated
with the treatment of these wells. On August29, 2003, the US Environmental Protection Agency issued
Unilateral Administrative Orders UAO against 41 parties deemed responsible
for polluting the groundwater in that portion of the San Gabriel Valley from
which SCWs two impacted wells draw water. SCW was not named as a party to the
UAO. The UAO requires that these parties remediate the contamination. As a
result of the issuance of the UAO, these parties have begun settlement
discussions regarding the Federal lawsuits with SCW, the other two affected
water purveyors and WQA. Registrant is presently unable to predict the ultimate
outcome of these settlement discussions. As discussed previously, MCO has filed a complaint against AWR and CCWC in
the Superior Court of Maricopa County CV 2003-011184 on June6, 2003 alleging
breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing, interference with prospective economic advantage, negligence and
negligent misrepresentation and seeking a declaratory judgment. The complaint
arises out of allegations by MCO that AWR has failed to comply with the terms
of the Stock Purchase Agreement between MCO and AWR pursuant to which AWR
acquired CCWC from MCO and has thereby interfered with MCOs ability to develop
its real property in the Town of Fountain Hills. A revised complaint was filed
on December12, 2003 further alleging that CCWC has not maintained its
designation of assured supply as required in the Stock Purchase Agreement.
Similar allegations have been filed by MCO against CCWC with the Arizona
Corporation Commission Docket No.W-02113A-3-0383. There have been settlement
discussions seeking to resolve these issues. In addition, CCWC has undertaken
actions that it believes will enable it to continue to maintain its assured
water supply designation in a manner that will enable CCWC to provide water
service to new real estate developments in the Town of Fountain Hills,
including properties owned by MCO. AWR and Arizona Department of Water
Resources ADWR have also agreed that the Town of Fountain Hills may approve
and record final parcel plats for subdivisions for which CCWC has entered into
written commitments to provide water service, conditional on iADWR sending a
notification to the Town that ADWR has approved a modification to CCWCs
designation or otherwise has determined that CCWC has enough water for current
and committed demands including the subdivision, and iiMCO not submitting a
request to the State Real Estate Commissioner for a public report for the
subdivision in advance of ADWRs issuance of the notification to the Town. 84 Table of Contents Note 12 - Contingencies Continued Condemnation of Properties The laws of the State of California provide for the acquisition of public
utility property by governmental agencies through their power of eminent
domain, also known as condemnation, where doing so is in the public interest.
In addition, however, the laws of the State of California also provide: 1
that the owner of the utility property may contest whether the condemnation is
actually in the public interest; and 2that the owner is entitled to receive
the fair market value of its property if the property is ultimately taken.
Although the City of Claremont, California located in SCWs Region III has not
initiated the formal condemnation process pursuant to California law, the City
hired a consultant to perform an appraisal of the value of Registrants water
system serving that city. SCW intends to vigorously defend itself against any
condemnation action initiated by the City. Other Litigation Registrant is also subject to ordinary routine litigation incidental to
its business. Other than those disclosed above, no other legal proceedings are
pending, which are believed to be material. Management believes that rate
recovery, proper insurance coverage and reserves are in place to insure against
property, general liability and workers compensation claims incurred in the
ordinary course of business. Note 13 - Construction Program Construction Program SCW maintains an ongoing water distribution main replacement program
throughout its customer service areas based on the priority of leaks detected,
fire protection enhancement and a reflection of the underlying replacement
schedule. In addition, SCW upgrades its electric and water supply facilities in
accordance with industry standards, local requirements and CPUC requirements.
SCWs Board of Directors has approved anticipated net capital expenditures for
2004 principally reflecting water supply related projects such as drilling and
equipping of new wells, building a new reservoir, and distribution and street
improvement projects. As of December31, 2003, SCW has unconditional purchase
obligations for capital projects of approximately $125million. CCWCs Board of Directors has approved a net capital budget for 2004
primarily reflecting a new treatment center building and distribution
improvement on its Golden Eagle Plant. AWR and ASUS have no material capital commitments. However, ASUS actively
seeks opportunities to own, lease or operate water and wastewater systems for
governmental entities, which may involve significant capital commitments. Registrant does not have any material capital expenditures for specific
environmental control facilities or measures. 85 Table of Contents Note 14 - Business Segments AWR has three principal business units: water and electric distribution
units, through its SCW subsidiary, a water-service utility operation conducted
through its CCWC unit, and a nonregulated activity unit through the ASUS
subsidiary. All activities of SCW currently are geographically located within
California. All activities of CCWC are located in the state of Arizona. All
activities of ASUS are conducted in California and Arizona. Both SCW and CCWC
are regulated utilities. On a stand-alone basis, AWR has no material assets
other than its investments in its subsidiaries. The tables below set forth
information relating to SCWs operating segments, CCWC and nonregulated
businesses. Included in the amounts set forth, certain assets, revenues and
expenses have been allocated. The identifiable assets are net of respective
accumulated provisions for depreciation. Capital additions reflect capital
expenditures paid in cash and exclude property installed by developers and
conveyed to the Company.

No133. 89 Table of Contents Report of Management The consolidated financial statements contained in the annual report were
prepared by the management of American States Water Company, which is
responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The consolidated financial
statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and include, where necessary, amounts based upon managements best
estimates and judgments. All other financial information in the annual report
is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and is also the
responsibility of management. Registrant maintains systems of internal control, which are designed to
help safeguard, the assets of Registrant and provide reasonable assurance that
accounting and financial records can be relied upon to generate accurate
financial statements. These systems include the hiring and training of
qualified personnel, appropriate segregation of duties, delegation of authority
and an internal audit function, which has reporting responsibility to the Audit
Committee of the board of directors. The Audit Committee, composed of three outside directors, exercises
oversight of managements discharge of its responsibilities regarding the
systems of internal control and financial reporting. The committee periodically
meets with management, the internal auditor and the independent accountants to
review the work and findings of each. The committee also reviews the
qualifications of, and recommends to the board of directors, a firm of
independent accountants. The independent accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, have performed an
audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards. Their audit gave consideration to Registrants
system of internal accounting control as a basis for establishing the nature,
timing and scope of their work. The result of their work is expressed in their
Report of Independent Auditors.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of American States Water Company In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated
statements of capitalization and the related consolidated statements of income,
of changes in common shareholders equity and of cash flows present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of American States Water Company
and its subsidiaries the Company and Southern California Water Company SCW
at December31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for the each of the three years in the period ended December31,
2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys and SCWs management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audits
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. As discussed in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements,
on January1, 2003 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No143 and began accruing for asset retirement obligations. As discussed in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements,
on January1, 2002 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No142 and changed its method of accounting for goodwill. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

Item5. Controls and Procedures Registrant has established disclosure controls and procedures that are
designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and
forms. In accordance with Exchange Act Rules13a-15 and 15d-15, Registrant
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of
the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of December31, 2003 to provide
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commissions rules and forms. Registrant has been reviewing the procedures and controls for development
of its tax accruals and current and deferred tax estimates. In the fourth
quarter of 2003, Registrant completed this review of its processes and controls
for developing its tax provision and related balances. This culminated in the
development of a formal procedure for the development and review of the tax
balances and estimates. Registrant hired a new tax manager to carry out the
review and to implement and comply with the formal procedures. In addition, Registrant has formalized procedures in place, covering the
bidding of capital projects. These procedures are designed to achieve the
lowest bid price from qualified contractors as well as to promote diversity
among contractors. The procedures also provide for bypass of a formal bid
process for emergency situations. Registrant has recently discovered that a
greater than anticipated percentage of contracts in certain areas were being
awarded on an emergency basis and to fewer than anticipated contractors.
Certain of those contracts are being further scrutinized by Registrant. In
addition, two executives involved in awarding such capital contracts have been
terminated, in part, for perceived failures to adequately follow Registrants
procedures. Registrant is evaluating its bidding procedures for capital
projects as a part of its review of internal controls in preparation for
compliance with Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and may, based on
the results of this review, modify those procedures in order to ensure that the
Companys objectives are being met in a consistent manner. 92 Table of Contents PART III
