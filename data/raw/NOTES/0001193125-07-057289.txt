ITEM8.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Diversa Corporation  We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Diversa Corporation as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Diversa Corporation at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Diversa Corporation changed its method of accounting for
share-based payments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 revised 2004 on January 1, 2006.  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that Diversa will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial
statements, Diversa has entered into a definitive merger agreement. The Company has insufficient cash and working capital to effect the merger and fund the combined business plan as contemplated, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to
continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Diversa Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 14, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.

DIVERSA CORPORATION  NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1.
Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  The Company  Diversa Corporation is a biotechnology company, founded in 1992, that customizes enzymes for manufacturers within the alternative fuels, industrial, and
health and nutrition markets to enable higher throughput, lower costs, and improved environmental outcomes.  As more fully described in the accompanying footnotes and prior filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, on January5, 2006 the Company
announced a strategic reorganization, pursuant to which the Company has focused its resources on advancing its most promising product candidates and programs that have the greatest near-term opportunities. As part of this reorganization, the Company
eliminated and/or significantly scaled back its investments in certain programs and lines of business which were not consistent with this current strategic focus. Specifically, the Company reduced or eliminated programs in fine chemicals, animal
health, therapeutic antibody optimization, and small molecule drug discovery. As a result, the Company reduced its workforce by 83 employees and consolidated its facilities. In connection with the reorganization, during the fourth quarter of 2005,
the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $457 million to write off long-lived tangible and intangible assets that the Company determined to be no longer essential to the Companys focus and determined to be impaired under current
accounting rules. During the twelve months ended December31, 2006, the Company also recorded net restructuring charges of $120 million related to employee separation and facilities consolidation costs as part of this reorganization See
Note 7Impairment Charges and Restructuring Activities.  Recent Strategic Events and Capital Requirements  As more fully described in Note 3Significant Agreements, in December 2006, the Company entered into a new agreement with Syngenta Participations AG Syngenta, a related party, which replaced
a prior agreement with Syngenta. Under the terms on the new 10-year agreement, Syngenta will commit a minimum of $160 million over the next two years to fund joint research and development activities, largely in defined areas of biofuels. This new
agreement reduces total committed funding as compared to the prior agreement by approximately $190 million over the next three years, but also gives the Company the freedom to operate in fields which were previously excluded under the prior
agreement.  In January 2007, the Company announced that it
would pursue opportunities for the vertically-integrated commercialization of biofuels, in particular ethanol from cellulosic biomass. To date, the Company has focused primarily on the development of novel, high-performance enzymes for cellulosic
biomass feedstocks as part of its specialty enzyme business.  In February 2007, as more fully described in Note 14Subsequent Events, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement with Celunol Corp. Celunol, a Delaware corporation. The merger agreement has been
approved by the boards of directors of both the Company and Celunol, and is subject to shareholder approval. In February 2007, Celunol completed a significant upgrade of its pilot-scale facility in Jennings, Louisiana and, on the same Celunol-owned
property, has begun construction of a 14 million gallons-per-year, demonstration-scale facility to produce cellulosic ethanol from sugarcane bagasse and specially-bred energy cane. Celunol expects that its demonstration-scale facility will be
mechanically complete by the end of 2007. 
75  DIVERSA CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
In connection with the proposed merger, the Company is committed to funding Celunol up to $20 million
in cash prior to the close of the transaction, subject to the terms and conditions of a promissory note.In addition, substantial cash requirements will be necessary to execute the combined business plan subsequent to the closing, which is
expected by the end of the second quarter of 2007. The Company
has insufficient cash and working capital to effect the merger and combined business plan as contemplated. Management believes that it will be able to obtain sufficient financing in the short-term to fund the operations of the combined entity
through at least 2007; however, there is substantial doubt as to whether the Company will be able to continue as a going concern through 2007 without access to additional working capital. If the Company cannot obtain sufficient additional financing
in the short-term, it may be forced to restructure or significantly curtail its operations, file for bankruptcy or cease operations.The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be forced to take any such actions.  Basis of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its two wholly-owned subsidiaries,
which were inactive as of December31, 2006. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.  Cash and Cash
Equivalents  The Company considers cash equivalents to
be only those investments which are highly liquid, readily convertible to cash and which mature within three months from the date of purchase.  Short-term Investments  Based on the nature of the assets held by the Company and managements investment strategy, the Companys investments have been classified as
available-for-sale. Management determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase. Securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at estimated fair value, as determined by quoted market prices, with
unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of comprehensive income. At December31, 2006, the Company had no investments that were classified as trading or held-to-maturity as defined by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB Statement No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion is included in interest income. Realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities are computed based upon initial cost adjusted for any other than temporary
declines in fair value and are included in interest income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest on securities classified as available-for-sale is included in interest income. 
76  DIVERSA CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Inventories  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is substantially determined by the first-in, first-out
method, and includes material, labor, and factory overhead. If necessary, the Company adjusts its inventories by an estimated allowance for excess and obsolete inventories. The determination of the need for an allowance is based on managements
review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales as well as judgments, quality control testing data, and assumptions about the likelihood of obsolescence. The Company maintained a valuation allowance of $350,000 and
$150,000 at December31, 2006 and 2005.  Concentration of Credit Risk  Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by placing its cash with high credit quality
financial institutions. The Company generally invests its excess cash in U.S. Treasury and government agency obligations and investment-grade corporate securities.  The Companys accounts receivable consist of amounts due from customers for the sale of products, amount due from
governmental agencies for costs incurred under funded projects, and amounts due from corporate partners under various collaboration agreements. The Company regularly assesses the need for an allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts
receivable arising from its customers inability to make required payments. The Company has a limited number of accounts receivable and uses the specific identification method as a basis for determining this estimate. Historically, losses
related to uncollectible accounts receivable have been minimal. The Company maintained an allowance for doubtful accounts of $229,000 at December31, 2006, and had no allowance for doubtful accounts at December31, 2005.  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated
useful lives of the assets generally three to five years using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets. For the years ended
December31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company recorded depreciation expense of $90 million, $125 million and $128 million, which includes the depreciation of assets under capital leases.  Acquired Intangible Assets  In accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB
No17, Accounting for Intangible Assets, the Companys intangible assets, which all fall into one intangible asset class, are recorded at cost and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from seven
to fifteen years. For purposes of evaluating impairment of the acquired intangible assets, the Company compares the carrying values and estimated future cash flows of both the acquired assets and the Companys internally developed technologies
on a combined basis. In connection with the Companys strategic reorganization, the Company determined, based on an analysis of estimated future cash flows, that the acquired intangible assets were fully impaired as of December31, 2005,
and recorded an impairment charge totaling $435 million to write off the value of these assets See Note 7Impairment Charges and Restructuring Activities.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  In accordance with FASB No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, if
indicators of impairment exist, the Company assesses the recoverability of the affected long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating 
77  DIVERSA CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
cash flows. If impairment is indicated, the Company measures the amount of such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the present value
of the expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset. In connection with the Companys strategic reorganization, the Company determined, based on an analysis of estimated future cash flows, that the Companys property and
equipment carrying values were impaired as of December31, 2005, and recorded an impairment charge totaling $22 million to write down the value of these assets to their net realizable value See Note 7Impairment Charges and
Restructuring Activities.  Fair Value of Financial
Instruments  Financial instruments, including cash and
cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, are carried at cost, which management believes approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying
amounts of debt obligations approximate their respective fair values as they bear terms that are comparable to those available under current market conditions. 
Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No104,
Revenue Recognition and Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.  Under SAB No104 revenue is recognized when the following criteria have
been met: i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; ii services have been rendered or product has been delivered; iii price to the customer is fixed and determinable; and iv collection of the underlying receivable is reasonably assured.
Billings to customers or payments received from customers are
included in deferred revenue on the balance sheet until all revenue recognition criteria are met.  Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables  The Company sometimes enters into revenue arrangements that contain multiple deliverables. The Company recognizes revenue from such arrangements entered
into subsequent to June30, 2003 in accordance with EITF No. 00-21. This issue addresses the timing and method of revenue recognition for revenue arrangements that include the delivery of more than one product or service. In these cases, the
Company recognizes revenue from each element of the arrangement as long as separate value for each element can be determined, the Company has completed its obligation to deliver or perform on that element, and collection of the resulting receivable
is reasonably assured.  Collaborative Revenue
The Company recognizes revenue from research funding
under collaboration agreements when earned on a proportional performance basis as research hours are incurred. The Company performs services as specified in each respective agreement on a best-efforts basis, and is reimbursed based on
labor hours incurred on each contract. The Company initially defers revenue for any amounts billed or payments received in advance of the services being performed and recognize revenue pursuant to the related pattern of performance, based on total
labor hours incurred relative to total labor hours estimated under the contract.  The Company recognizes fees received to initiate research projects over the life of the project. The Company recognizes fees received for exclusivity in a field over the period of exclusivity. 
78  DIVERSA CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The Company recognizes milestone payments when earned, as evidenced by written acknowledgement from
the collaborator, provided that ithe milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement, iithe milestone represents the culmination of an earnings process, iiithe
milestone payment is non-refundable and ivthe Companys past research and development services, as well as its ongoing commitment to provide research and development services under the collaboration, are charged at fees that are
comparable to the fees that the Company customarily charges for similar research and development services.  Product-Related Revenue  The Company recognizes product-related revenue at the time of shipment to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The
Company recognizes revenue on product sales through third-party distribution agreements, if the distributor has a right of return, in accordance with the provisions set forth in Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement FASB
No48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists. Under FASB No48, the Company recognizes product revenues upon shipment to distributors, provided that ithe price is substantially fixed and determinable
at the time of sale; iithe distributors obligation to pay the Company is not contingent upon resale of the products; iiititle and risk of loss passes to the distributor at time of shipment; ivthe distributor has
economic substance apart from that provided by the Company; vthe Company has no significant obligation to the distributor to bring about resale of the products; and vifuture returns can be reasonably estimated. For any sales that do
not meet all of the above criteria, revenue is deferred until all such criteria have been met.  The Company recognizes product-related profit-sharing revenue during the quarter in which such revenue is earned, based on estimates provided by the Companys profit-sharing partner. These estimates are adjusted
for actual results in the subsequent quarter. Profit-sharing revenue is included in product-related revenue in the statement of operations.  Grant Revenue  The Company recognizes revenue from grants as related costs are incurred, as long as such costs are within the funding limits specified by the underlying
grant agreements.  Deferred Revenue  As of December31, 2006, the Company had $62 million in deferred
revenue, of which $12 million was related to product sales, and $50 million was related to funding from collaborative partners.  Research and Development  Research and development expenses, including direct and allocated expenses, consist of independent research and development costs, as well as costs
associated with sponsored research and development. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  Cost of Product-Related Revenue  Cost of product-related revenue includes both internal and third-party fixed and variable costs including materials and supplies, labor, facilities and
other overhead costs associated with its product-related revenues. The Company expenses the cost of idle manufacturing capacity to cost of product-related revenue as incurred. 
79  DIVERSA CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Income Taxes  Current income tax expense benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable receivable for the current year.
A deferred income tax asset or liability is computed for the expected future impact of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and
credit carry-forwards. Deferred income tax expense is generally the net change during the year in the deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are established unless, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than
not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. The effect of tax rate changes is reflected in income tax expense benefit during the period in which such changes are enacted. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance against any
deferred tax assets.  Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss is defined as the change in equity
of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, including unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities. The Company presents comprehensive loss in its Consolidated
Statements of Stockholders Equity.  Net Loss per
Share  Basic and diluted net loss per share has been
computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. During the year ended December31, 2006 and 2005, the Company issued approximately 1,035,000 and 726,000 restricted shares to employees, of
which 1,118,000 shares and 560,000 shares were unvested. For purposes of the computation of net loss per share, these unvested shares are considered contingently returnable shares under FASB No128, Earnings Per Share, and
are not considered outstanding common shares for purposes of computing net loss per share until all necessary conditions are met that no longer cause the shares to be contingently returnable. The impact of these unvested shares on weighted average
shares outstanding has been excluded for purposes of computing net loss per share.  The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share in thousands, except per share data:  Years Ended December31 2006 2005 2004 Weighted average shares outstanding during the period 47,503 44,589 43,416 Less: Weighted average unvested restricted shares outstanding 1,029 525 Weighted average shares used in computing basic and diluted net loss per share 46,474 44,064 43,416 Net loss 39,271 89,718 33,425 Net loss per share, basic and diluted 085 204 077  The Company has
excluded all outstanding stock options and warrants from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because all such securities are anti-dilutive for all applicable periods presented. The total number of shares excluded from the calculations of
diluted net loss per share, prior to application of the treasury stock method for options and warrants, was 50million, 89million, and 98million for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. Such securities, had
they been dilutive, would have been included in the computation of diluted earnings per share. 
80  DIVERSA CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Segment Reporting  Through December31, 2006, the Company operated in only one segment. Accordingly, no segment disclosures have been
included in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.  Reclassification  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  Effect of New Accounting Standards  In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan
interpretation of FASB Statement No109 FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 requires recognition in the financial statements of the impact of a tax position, if that position
is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The provisions are effective for our first quarter 2007 financial statements with the cumulative effect, if any, of the change in accounting
principle recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on its consolidated financial statements but does not expect the impact to be material.  In September2006, the FASB issued FASB No157, Fair Value
Measurements. FASB No157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FASB No157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after November15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that SFAS No157 will have on its consolidated financial statements.  In February2007, the FASB issued FASB No159, The Fair Value
Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an Amendment of FASB Statement No115. This standard permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Most of the
provisions in FASB No159 are elective; however, the amendment to FASB No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, applies to all entities with available-for-sale and trading securities. The fair
value option established by FASB No159 permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates. A business entity will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has
been elected in earnings or another performance indicator if the business entity does not report earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The fair value option: amay be applied instrument by instrument, with a few exceptions, such as
investments otherwise accounted for by the equity method; bis irrevocable unless a new election date occurs; and cis applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments. FASB No159 is effective as of the
beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November15, 2007. The Company does not expect the adoption of FASB No159 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Significant Agreements  The Company has a number of strategic alliances and relationships, the more significant of which include the following:  Research and Development Collaborations  Syngenta  The following summarizes the Companys relationship with Syngenta AG,
and its affiliates collectively, Syngenta, a related party see Note 5Related Party Transactions:  In 1999, the Company entered into a strategic alliance with Syngenta. In conjunction with the transaction, Syngenta Biotechnology purchased 5,555,556
shares of Series E convertible preferred stock which converted to 
84  DIVERSA CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
common shares upon completion of the Companys initial public offering, paid a technology access fee, and provided project research funding to the
Company, for aggregate total proceeds of $125 million.  Also
in 1999, the Company formed a five-year strategic alliance with Syngenta. Through a contract joint venture, named Zymetrics, Inc., the Company and Syngenta jointly pursued opportunities in the field of animal feed and agricultural product
processing. Under the agreement, Syngenta received exclusive, worldwide rights in the field of animal feed and project exclusive, worldwide rights in the field of agricultural product processing. Syngenta agreed to pay $200 million for the rights
granted under the original agreement, which expired in 2004. In May 2004, the Company entered into an agreement with Syngenta that continued the development and commercialization of novel animal feed enzymes beyond the five-year initial term of the
1999 Zymetrics joint venture agreement.  During 2003, the
Company completed a series of transactions with Syngenta and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Torrey Mesa Research Institute TMRI. Under the transactions, the companies formed an extensive research collaboration whereby the Company was
entitled to receive a minimum of $1180 million in research and development funding over the initial seven-year term of the related research collaboration agreement. The Company also purchased certain property and equipment from TMRI and assumed
certain miscellaneous liabilities under equipment maintenance contracts.  Upon closing, the Company issued to Syngenta and TMRI a total of 6,034,983 shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase 1,293,211 shares of common stock at $2200 per share that is exercisable for ten years
starting in 2008. The total value of the acquisition was approximately $740 million, of which $549 million was allocated to certain intangible assets. In December 2005, in connection with its strategic reorganization, the Company recorded an
impairment charge related to the write-down of the carrying values of assets and technologies acquired as part of the acquisition See Note 7Impairment Charges and Restructuring Activities.  In December 2006, the Company entered into a new 10-year research and
development partnership with Syngenta which replaced the 2003 agreement and is focused on the discovery and development of enzymes to economically convert pre-treated cellulosic biomass to mixed sugarsa critical step in the process of biofuel
production. Under the terms of the new agreement, Syngenta will commit a minimum of $160 million over the next two years to fund joint research and development activities, largely in defined areas of biofuels. In addition, the Company will be
entitled to development- and commercialization-related milestone payments as well as royalties on any products that are commercialized by Syngenta. This new license and research agreement allows us to independently develop and commercialize
fermentation-based enzyme combinations from our proprietary platform, and we are free to pursue opportunities for the integrated commercialization of biofuels. Syngenta will have the rights to market and sell plant-expressed, or transgenic, enzyme
products developed under the collaboration in the fields of animal feed or biofuels. The Company has also licensed its existing collection of enzymes for plant expression to Syngenta within these two fields.  As a result of the restructuring of the Syngenta agreement, the
Companys minimum guaranteed collaborative revenue will be reduced by approximately $190 million over the next 3 years, with $120 million of this reduction occurring in 2007.  The Company also has a manufacturing agreement with an affiliate of Syngenta to supply commercial quantities of Quantum
phytase at a fixed price, determined by a negotiated formula that is subject to adjustment during the term of the agreement. In addition, the Company is entitled to receive royalties from Syngenta on sales of Quantum phytase.  Total revenue recognized under the Syngenta agreements was $227 million 243 million, and $369 million for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. 
85  DIVERSA CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
DuPont Bio-Based Materials  In 2003, the Company entered into a six-year alliance with DuPont Bio-Based
Materials DuPont. This multi-year program is being co-funded by the U.S. Department of Energy DOE, and is focused on the development of an integrated corn-based biorefinery ICBR for the production of ethanol
and other value-added chemical products from corn biomass. The program includes within its consortium the National Renewable Energy Lab, or NREL, which is part of the DOE. The Companys objective under the program is to discover, optimize, and
manufacture a cocktail of enzymes that can efficiently convert the different components of an entire corn plant, including the stalk, into simple sugars that can then be used to make ethanol and other products. The Company has received
research funding, as well as milestone payments, and is entitled to additional milestone payments as well as royalties on any new products developed under the agreement that incorporate the Companys technologies.  In 2005, the Company announced that the performance of the enzymes developed
under the ICBR program with DuPont substantially exceeded the initial targets set by the Department of Energy, triggering a milestone payment to the Company of approximately $500,000. DuPont has the right to exclusively license a selected number of
enzymes comprising this cocktail for use in converting biomass to fuels and/or other chemicals, in exchange for the payment to the Company of up-front license fees and running royalties on sales of these enzymes or DuPonts revenues from
licensing technologies to third parties that include one or more enzymes the Company may have licensed to DuPont.  Revenue recognized under the DuPont ICBR program was $15 million, $30 million and $24 million for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and
2004.  DSM  In 2003, the Company entered into a collaborative agreement with DSM Pharma

under the Bunge agreements was $22 million and $07 million for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005.  Government Grants and Contracts  The Company has received grants and contracts from a number of government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of
Energy, and the National Institutes of Health. Revenue related to government grants and contracts was $33 million, $101 million, and $102 million for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005, and 2004.  Manufacturing, Supply and Distribution Agreements  Valley Research, inc  In 2005, the Company signed, and later amended, a distribution agreement
with Valley Research, inc. Valley covering the Ultra-Thin alpha amylase enzyme and potentially additional enzyme products. Under the amended agreement, the Company appointed Valley as its exclusive distributor in the United States for
Ultra-Thin enzyme for ethanol and high fructose corn sweetener applications, subject to certain limitations, and subject to certain conditions required to be met for such exclusivity to be maintained. Valley must purchase certain minimum dollar
amounts of Ultra-Thin enzyme from the Company during each year of the agreement in order to maintain exclusivity. The term of this distribution agreement regarding Ultra-Thin enzyme is for a period of 
87  DIVERSA CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
fiveyears following regulatory approval of such enzyme by the FDAs Center for Veterinary Medicine, which approval was obtained on
February24, 2006.  The Company has deferred revenue on
its 2006 sales of this product to Valley, as it does not believe that, given its limited commercial experience with this product and Valley, all criteria for recognizing revenue related to its 2006 sales to Valley have been met. Specifically, the
Company plans to continue to defer revenue on sales to Valley until its has established to the Companys satisfaction that payment for the product is not dependent on Valleys sales of the product to its customers.  As more fully described in Note 6Litigation, the Company and
Valley are currently in a legal dispute over alleged breach of contract on the part of both parties.  Danisco Animal Nutrition  In May 1996, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with Danisco Animal Nutrition formerly Finnfeeds International Ltd to jointly identify
and develop a novel phytase enzyme that when used as an additive in animal feed applications allows higher utilization of phytic acid phosphates from the feed, thereby increasing its nutritional value. The addition of phytase to animal feed reduces
the need for inorganic phosphorus supplementation and lowers the level of harmful phosphates that are introduced to the environment through animal waste, resulting in inorganic phosphate cost savings and a significant reduction in environmental
pollution. Following the completion of the initial objectives of the agreement with Danisco, in December 1998, the Company entered into a license agreement with Danisco to commercialize an enzyme developed under the collaboration agreement. Under
the terms of the license agreement, the Company granted Danisco an exclusive license to manufacture, use, and sell the developed enzyme. In consideration for the license, the Company is paid a profit share equal to 50% of the cumulative profits
generated by Danisco on such sales. The Company also has a manufacturing agreement with Danisco to supply commercial quantities of Phyzyme XP at the Companys cost to manufacture such quantities. In March 2003, the FDA approved Phyzyme XP
Animal Feed Enzyme, which the Company developed in collaboration with Danisco. In September 2006, the EU Commission granted permanent authorization for the use of Phyzyme XP in broiler poultry feed in Europe.  Revenue recognized from transactions with Danisco, including contract
manufacturing performed on behalf of Danisco, was $89 million, $52 million, and $20 million for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005, and 2004.  License Agreements  Xoma Ltd.  In 2003, the Company signed a license and product development agreement with Xoma Ltd. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company received a license to
use Xomas antibody expression technology for developing antibody products independently and with collaborators, and an option to a license for the production of antibodies under the Xoma patents. The Company paid an initial license fee of $20
million, which was initially capitalized and was being amortized over the estimated useful life of seven years. Under the agreement, the Company may also be required to pay future milestones and royalties. As of December31, 2005, in connection
with the Companys strategic reorganization, the Company assessed the carrying value of this license on its balance sheet and determined that it was impaired. As a result, the Company has written off the carrying value of the license on its
balance sheet as of December31, 2005 See Note 7Impairment Charges and Restructuring Activities. 
88  DIVERSA CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Terragen Discovery, Inc.  In November 1999, the Company signed a license agreement with Terragen Discovery Inc., or Terragen, under which the Company
and Terragen agreed to cross license certain technologies. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company made an initial payment of $25 million in 1999 and agreed to make annual payments of $01 million to Terragen to maintain the patent rights
over the remaining patent life. The Company capitalized the initial payment as an intangible asset, which through December31, 2005 was amortized over the sixteen year patent life. As of December31, 2005, in connection with the
Companys strategic reorganization, the Company assessed the carrying values of this license on its balance sheet and determined that it was impaired. As a result, the Company has written off the carrying value of the license on its balance
sheet as of December31, 2005 See Note 7Impairment Charges and Restructuring Activities.  Other Agreements  The
Company has signed various agreements with research institutions, as well as other commercial entities. Generally, these agreements call for the Company to pay research support, cost reimbursement, and, in some cases, subsequent royalty payments in
the event a product is commercialized. The financial impact of these agreements on the Company is not significant.  4.
Debt  The Company has entered into various equipment financing line of credit agreements with lenders to finance equipment purchases. Under the terms of the credit agreements, equipment purchases are structured as notes and
are to be repaid over periods ranging from 36 to 48 months at interest rates ranging from 699% to 1043%. The notes are secured by the related equipment.  On September30, 2005, the Company entered into a $146 million Loan and Security Agreement the Bank Agreement with a commercial bank
the Bank. The Bank Agreement provides for a one-year credit facility for up to $100million in financing for qualified equipment purchases in the United States and Mexico the Equipment Advances and a $46 million
letter of credit sub-facility the Letter of Credit Sublimit. The Bank Agreement was amended in October 2006 to increase the Letter of Credit Sublimit to $47 million. Borrowings under the Equipment Advances are structured as promissory
notes which are secured by qualified equipment purchases and repaid over 36 to 48months, depending on the location of the equipment financed. Borrowings will bear interest at the Banks prime rate 825% at December31, 2006 plus
075%. On September30, 2006, the Companys draw-down period under the Equipment Advances expired.  At December31, 2006, there was approximately $37 million in outstanding borrowings under the Equipment Advances and a letter of credit for
approximately $47 million under the Letter of Credit Sublimit, as required under the Companys facilities leases See Note 6Commitments and Contingencies.  The Bank Agreement contains standard affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions on actions by the Company
including, but not limited to, activity related to the Companys common stock repurchases, liens, investments, indebtedness, and fundamental changes in, or dispositions of, the Companys assets. Certain of these actions may be taken by the
Company with the consent of the Bank. In addition, the Company is required to meet certain financial covenants, primarily a minimum balance of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments in marketable securities of $250 million, including
$150 million maintained in accounts at the Bank or its affiliates. 
89  DIVERSA CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
As of December31, 2006 the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants under its various
financing agreements; however, the Company could be at risk of non compliance with its covenants under the Bank Agreement if it is unable to raise additional capital during 2007 See Note 1Recent Strategic Events and Capital
Requirements. The Bank Agreement also provides for an event of default upon the occurrence of a material adverse effect on i the business operations, condition financial or otherwise or prospects of the Company, ii the ability of the
Company to repay its obligations due to the bank or otherwise perform its obligations under the Bank Agreement, or iii the Companys interest in, or the value of, perfection or priority of the banks security interest in the collateral.
In the event of non compliance or a material adverse effect, the Company would be required to cash-secure its existing obligations under the Bank Agreement $84 million at December31, 2006.  At December31, 2006, the Companys future minimum payments under

Related Party Transactions  Syngenta AG  The Company has had an ongoing research collaboration with Syngenta, a greater-than 10% owner of the Companys outstanding common stock since 1999.
See Note 3Significant Agreements.  The Company
recognized revenue from Syngenta and its affiliates of $227 million, $243 million, and $369 million for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. Accounts receivable due from Syngenta were $04 million and $17 million, and deferred
revenue associated with Syngenta was $31 million and $59 million, at December31, 2006 and 2005.  In connection with the research collaboration with Syngenta, the Company received $03 million and $05 million in rental cost reimbursements from
Syngenta during the year ended December31, 2006 and 2005, which was recorded as a reduction in rent expense See Note 6Leases.  Notes Receivable from Officers  In February 2000, the Company initiated a loan program for six employees to pay personal tax liabilities resulting from the failure to file Form 83b
elections with the Internal Revenue Service related to those employees exercise of incentive and non-qualified stock options during 1999. This failure to timely file the Form 83b elections exposed the employees to significant personal tax
liabilities. The Company agreed to loan the employees up to $16 million in full recourse promissory notes. As of December31, 2005, the Company had 
90  DIVERSA CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
a remaining loan balance from three individuals aggregating $06 million, which amounts are included in other current assets on the accompanying balance
sheet. The notes bore interest at 494%, and were repaid in full as they came due in April 2006.  6.
Commitments and Contingencies  Leases  At December31, 2006, the Companys minimum commitments under non-cancelable operating leases were as follows in thousands:  Operating Leases

Thereafter 31,405 Total minimum lease payments 51,747  In November 2000, the
Company relocated its San Diego operations to a 75,000 square foot facility. In April 2002, the Company occupied an additional 60,000 square foot research and development facility adjacent to its existing office. The operating leases for the
Companys two facilities expire in November 2015 and March 2017.  For the years ended December31, 2006, 2005, and 2003 rent and administrative service expense under operating leases was approximately $39 million, $46 million, and $49 million, net of rental income and restructuring charges. As
more fully described in Note 7Impairment and Restructuring Activities, the Company recorded a restructuring charge and related restructuring liability based on space vacated in its 60,000 square foot facility during 2006. As of
December31, 2006, approximately 75% of this space was idle. Accordingly, the rent payments of approximately $11 million related to the idle space are not included in rent expense, but rather recorded against the restructuring reserve as paid.
During 2006 and 2005, the Company received $03 million and
$05 million of rent reimbursement from Syngenta, a related party See Note 5Related Party Transactions.  Under the terms of its facilities leases, the Company is required to maintain an irrevocable standby letter of credit from a bank in lieu of a cash
security deposit. The amount of the letter of credit is based upon certain financial covenants requiring minimum market capitalization or working capital. As of December1, 2006, the amount of the letter of credit required was $47 million,
which has been issued under the Companys Bank Agreement See Note 4Debt. Amounts outstanding under the letter of credit are unsecured, and are subject to an annual fee of 125%.  During 2002, the Company entered into a manufacturing agreement with Fermic,
S.A. de C.V. Fermic, a fermentation and synthesis plant located in Mexico City, to provide the Company with the capacity to produce commercial quantities of certain enzyme products. Based on actual and projected increased product
requirements, the agreement was amended in 2004 to provide for additional capacity to be installed over the succeeding four year period. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company can cancel the committed 
91  DIVERSA CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
purchases with thirty months notice provided that the term of the agreement, including the termination notice period, aggregates four years. Pursuant
to the agreement with Fermic, the Company is also obligated to reimburse monthly costs related to manufacturing activities. These costs scale up as the projected manufacturing volume increases. As of December31, 2006, the Company had minimum
commitments to Fermic under this agreement of approximately $247 million over the next three years. In addition, under the terms of the agreement, the Company is required to purchase certain equipment required for fermentation and downstream
processing of the products. Through December31, 2006, the Company had incurred costs of approximately $134 million for equipment related to this agreement. During 2007, the Company anticipates spending as much as $30 million in additional
equipment costs related to the manufacturing agreement. As the Company continues to develop its commercial manufacturing platforms, it will be required to purchase additional capital equipment under this agreement.  The Company relies on Fermic as its sole-source manufacturer for large
volumes of commercial enzymes.  Litigation  Class Action Shareholder Lawsuit  In June 2004, we executed a settlement agreement with the Plaintiffs
pursuant to the terms of the memorandum of understanding. On February 15, 2005, the Court issued a decision certifying a class action for settlement purposes and granting preliminary approval of the settlement subject to modification of certain bar
orders contemplated by the settlement. On August 31, 2005, the Court reaffirmed class certification and preliminary approval of the modified settlement in a comprehensive Order. On February 24, 2006, the Court dismissed litigation filed against
certain underwriters in connection with the claims to be assigned to the plaintiffs under the settlement. On April 24, 2006, the Court held a Final Fairness Hearing to determine whether to grant final approval of the settlement. On December 5, 2006,
the Second Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the lower Courts earlier decision certifying as class actions the six IPO Cases designated as focus cases. The Court has ordered a stay of all proceedings in all of the IPO Cases pending
the outcome of Plaintiffs rehearing petition to the Second Circuit. Accordingly, the Courts decision on final approval of the settlement remains pending. The Company is covered by a claims-made liability insurance policy which it
believes will satisfy any potential liability of the Company under this settlement. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and assignment of claims against the Underwriters, and because the settlement has not yet been finally approved by
the Court, the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be predicted. In accordance with FASB No5, Accounting for Contingencies the Company believes any contingent liability related to this claim is not probable or estimable
and therefore no amounts have been accrued in regards to this matter.  Valley Research, inc.  On
September22, 2006, the Company issued a letter to Valley which communicated the Companys intent to exercise certain rights under the distribution agreement between the Company and Valley see Note 3Significant Agreements.
Specifically, the Company stated that it terminated Valleys exclusivity on the basis of certain minimum sales requirements not having been met as of August24, 2006, as provided by the distribution agreement.  On December7,
2006, Valley filed a civil complaint in San Diego Superior Court against the Company, alleging breach of contract. In the complaint, Valley alleges that the Valley Ultra-Thin product was unstable and performed poorly, which caused Valley to be unable to satisfy certain contractual requirements. In the complaint, Valley seeks
money damages for alleged breach of contract by the Company and potentially for additional damages for termination of Valleys exclusivity. The Company believes that the claims made by Valley have no merit, and intends to defend itself
vigorously.

On January8, 2007 the Company filed a cross-complaint in San Diego Superior Court against
Valley, alleging breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violation of the California Business and Professional Code. In its cross-complaint, the Company seeks payment in full of outstanding invoices due
from Valley. Pursuant to a letter dated March7, 2007, Diversa Corporation, a Delaware corporation, terminated that certain Distribution Agreement, dated January1, 2005, and the Amendment thereto dated August1, 2005 the
Agreement, between Diversa and Valley covering the enzyme Diversa currently markets under the Fuelzyme-LF label.  Under the Agreement, Valley was previously Diversas exclusive distributor in the United States for the Valley Ultra-Thin enzyme for
ethanol and high fructose corn sweetener applications, subject to certain limitations, and subject to certain conditions required to be met for such exclusivity to be maintained. On September22, 2006, Diversa terminated Valleys
exclusivity on the basis of certain minimum sales requirements not having been met as of August24, 2006, as provided by the Agreement. The term of the Agreement was set to expire on February24, 2011. Diversas termination of the
Agreement was based on, among other things, Valleys failure to meet certain minimum purchase requirements for the Valley Ultra-Thin enzyme. Specifically, Valley failed to purchase a minimum of $2,600,000 worth of the Valley
Ultra-Thin enzyme from Diversa within one year of the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations Center for Veterinary Medicines approval of the ValleyUltra-Thin enzyme. Pursuant to the Agreement, the termination was
effective immediately upon Valleys receipt of notice from Diversa of its intention to terminate the Agreement.  In accordance with FASB No5, Accounting for Contingencies the Company believes any contingent liability related to this claim is
not probable or estimable and therefore no amounts have been accrued in regards to this matter.  7.
Impairment Charges and Restructuring Activities  During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a $457million impairment charge for activities resulting from managements strategic

Stockholders Equity  Shareholder Rights Plan  On December13, 2000, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the adoption of a shareholder rights plan the Rights Plan. Under
the Rights Plan, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of one right to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series A junior participating preferred stock a Right for each share of Company common stock outstanding as of
December22, 2000. The exercise price of each Right is $12500.  Initially, the Rights trade with the Companys common stock and are not separately transferable. However, subject to certain exceptions, the Rights will become exercisable iat such time that a person or group of affiliated
persons acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding Company common stock an Acquiring Person or iion the tenth business day after a person or entity commences, or expresses an intention to commence, a
tender or exchange offer that would result in such person acquiring 15% or more of the outstanding Company common stock. In December 2002, in connection with the Companys entering into a series of agreements with Syngenta and Torrey Mesa
Research Institute, the Company amended the Rights Plan to provide that, with respect to Syngenta and its affiliates and associates, the threshold will be 22% rather than 15% for the aggregate beneficial ownership of the Companys common stock
that their holdings may not exceed without the Rights becoming exercisable.  In the event a person becomes an Acquiring Person, each Right held by all persons other than the Acquiring Person will become the right to acquire one share of Company common stock at a price equal to 50% of the
then-current market value of the Company common stock. Furthermore, in the event an Acquiring Person effects a merger of the Company, each Right will entitle the holder thereof to purchase one share of common stock of the Acquiring Person or the
Acquiring Persons ultimate parent at a price equal to 50% of the then-current market value of the Acquiring Persons or the Acquiring Persons ultimate parents common stock.  The Board of Directors can redeem the Rights at any time prior to a person
becoming an Acquiring Person at a redemption price of $001 per Right. In addition, the Board of Directors may, after any time a person becomes an Acquiring Person, exchange each Right for one share of common stock of the Company. The Rights will
expire on December12, 2010 if not redeemed prior to such date.

Equity Incentive Plans and Warrants  Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plans  2005 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan 
In March 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company Board adopted the Companys 2005 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive
Plan Directors Plan, and reserved a total of 600,000 shares for issuance thereunder. The number of shares available for issuance under the Directors Plan will automatically increase on the first trading day of each calendar
year, beginning with the 2006 calendar year and continuing through and including calendar year 2015, by an amount equal to the excess of ithe number of shares subject to stock awards granted during the preceding calendar year, over
iithe number of shares added back to the share reserve during the preceding calendar year pursuant to expirations, terminations, cancellations forfeitures and repurchases of previously granted awards. However this automatic annual increase
shall not exceed 250,000 shares in any calendar year.  The
Board adopted the Directors Plan as the primary equity incentive program for the Companys non-employee directors in order to secure and retain the services of such individuals, and to provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum
efforts for the success of the Company. The Directors Plan replaced the 1999 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan. As of December31, 2006, there were approximately 330,000 shares outstanding under the Directors Plan and
approximately 312,000 shares outstanding under the 1999 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan.  Employee Stock Option and Stock Purchase Plans  1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan  In December 1999, the Board of Directors adopted the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan. As of December31, 2006, a
total of 1,784,000 shares of the Companys common stock have been reserved for issuance under the Purchase Plan. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock at a discount, but only through payroll deductions, during
defined offering periods. The price at which stock is purchased under the Purchase Plan is equal to 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or last day of the offering period, whichever is lower. The Purchase Plan provides for
annual increases of shares available for issuance under the Purchase Plan.  1997 Equity Incentive Plan  In August 1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Equity Incentive Plan the 1997 Plan, which provides for the granting of incentive or non-statutory stock options, stock bonuses, and rights to purchase restricted stock to
employees, directors, and consultants as administered by the Board of Directors. Unless terminated sooner by the Board of Directors, the 1997 Plan will terminate in August 2007.  The incentive and non-statutory stock options are granted with an exercise price of not less than 100% and 85 respectively, of the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock as determined by the Board of Directors. The 1997 Plan allows the purchase of restricted stock at a price that is not less than 85% of the estimated fair value of the
Companys common stock as determined by the Board of Directors.  Options granted under the 1997 Plan vest over periods ranging up to four years and are exercisable over periods not exceeding ten years. As of December31, 2006, the aggregate number of shares which may be awarded under the 1997 Plan
is approximately 12,983,000, with approximately 4,076,000 available for grant. 
96  DIVERSA CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Accounting for Share-Based Compensation  In January 2006 the Company adopted FASB No123R,
Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of FASB No123, Accounting for Share-based Compensation. FASB No123R supersedes APB No25 and amends FASB No95, Statement of Cash
Flows. Generally, the approach in FASB No123R is similar to the approach described in FASB No123. However, FASB No123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to
be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure, which has previously been used by the Company, is no longer an alternative.  The Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of FASB No123R, using the modified prospective transition
method. Under this transition method, compensation expense includes options vesting for i share-based payments granted prior to, but not vested as of December31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
original provisions of FASB No123; ii share-based payments granted after December31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FASB No123R; and iii shares issued under the ESPP
after December31, 2005, based on calculations of fair value which are similar to how stock option valuations are made. Because this transition method was selected, results of prior periods have not been restated.  Prior to January1, 2006, the Company accounted for share-based employee
compensation plans using the intrinsic value method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related interpretations.
Under the provisions of APB 25, no compensation expense was recognized with respect to purchases of the Companys common stock under the ESPP or when stock options were granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than market value on the
date of grant.  All of the Companys equity incentive
plans are considered to be compensatory plans under FASB No123R.  The Company recognized $57 million $012 per share and $09 million $002 per share in share-based compensation expense for its share-based awards for years ended December31, 2006 and 2005. These charges
had no impact on the Companys reported cash flows. Share-based compensation expense was allocated among the following expense categories in thousands:  YEARENDED DECEMBER 31 2006
2005
Research and development 3,611 476
Selling, general and administrative 2,079 401 5,690 877  During 2005, the
Company issued approximately 726,000 shares of restricted stock to employees and, pursuant to FASB No123, recorded net expense of $08 million related to the amortization of deferred stock-based compensation during the year ended
December31, 2005. The Company also recorded a non-cash share-based compensation charge of approximately $01 million during the fourth quarter of 2005 related to the acceleration of vesting on approximately 28,000 restricted shares granted to
its former Chief Executive Officer. Under the modified prospective method of transition under FASB No123R, the Company is not required to restate its prior period financial statements to reflect expensing of share-based compensation under
the new standard. Therefore, the results for the year ended December31, 2006 are not comparable to 2005. 
97  DIVERSA CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The Company has determined its share-based compensation expense under FASB No123R for the
year ended December31, 2006 as follows:  Valuation of
Stock Options  Share-based compensation related to stock
options includes both the amortization of the fair value of options granted prior to January1, 2006, determined using the multiple option approach under the Black-Scholes-Merton BSM valuation model, as well as the amortization of
the fair value of options granted after December31, 2005, determined using the single option approach under the BSM valuation model. The fair value of options determined under FASB No123R is amortized to expense over the vesting
periods of the underlying options, generally four years.  The
fair value of stock option awards for the twelve months ended December31, 2006 was estimated on the date of grant using the assumptions in the following table. The expected volatility in this model is based on the historical volatility of the
Companys stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time awards are granted, based on maturities which approximate the expected life of the options. The expected life of the options granted is
estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees. The expected dividend rate takes into account the absence of any historical dividends paid by the Company and managements intention to retain all earnings for future operations and
expansion.  AverageRisk-Free InterestRate

Awards  Share-based compensation related to awards issued
under the ESPP after December31, 2005 are based on calculations of fair value under the BSM valuation model which are similar to how stock option valuations are made. The fair value of ESPP awards determined under FASB No123R is
amortized to expense over the vesting periods of the underlying awards, ranging from six months to two years. For the twelve months ended December31, 2006, the fair value was based on the following assumptions.  AverageRisk-Free InterestRate

Valuation of
Non-Restricted and Restricted Stock Awards  The fair value
of non-restricted and restricted stock awards is equal to the closing market price of the Companys common stock at the date of grant. The fair value of non-restricted awards is charged to share-based compensation upon grant. The fair value of
restricted awards is amortized to share-based compensation expense over the vesting period of the underlying awards, ranging from two years to four years.  Forfeiture Rate for Options and Restricted Stock Awards 
The Company is required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods on a cumulative basis in the
period the estimated forfeiture rate changes for all share-based awards. The Company considered its historical experience of pre-vesting option forfeitures as the basis to arrive at its estimated pre-vesting option forfeiture rate of 5%per
year for the year ended December31, 2006 for all share-based awards. 
98  DIVERSA CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Unrecognized Share-Based Compensation Expense  As of December31, 2006, there was approximately $60 million of total
unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the equity incentive plans. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 14 years as follows:  inthousands
Fiscal Year 2007 3,795
Fiscal Year 2008 1,772
Fiscal Year 2009 409
Fiscal Year 2010 21 5,997  During the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of unvested stock options awarded to all employees and officers under its stock option plans that had exercise prices greater than $1000. The unvested options to purchase approximately
710,000 shares became fully vested as of December8, 2005 as a result of the acceleration. These stock options would have all become fully vested before or during 2008. The Company accelerated these options because the options had exercise
prices significantly in excess of the then current market value $525 at December8, 2005, and thus were not fully achieving their original objectives of incentive compensation and employee retention. The acceleration eliminated future
compensation expense that would have been recognized in the statements of operations with respect to these options with the implementation of FASB No123R. The future expense eliminated as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of these
options was approximately $11 million.  Prior Year Pro

Subsequent Events  Proposed Merger Transaction with Celunol Corp  On February12, 2007, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement with Celunol Corp., a Delaware corporation, pursuant to which the
parties agreed to a merger transaction involving the merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company into Celunol, with Celunol continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The merger agreement has been
approved by the boards of directors of both the Company and Celunol.  Management believes that the combined company will be the first within the cellulosic ethanol industry to possess integrated end-to-end capabilities in pre-treatment, novel enzyme development, fermentation, engineering, and project
development. It will seek to build a global enterprise as a leading producer of cellulosic ethanol and as a strategic partner in bio-refineries around the world. The combined company will be headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts and have
research and operations facilities in San Diego, California; Jennings, Louisiana; and Gainesville, Florida.

AND PROCEDURES.  Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive officer, and Chief Financial Officer, who is our principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and
procedures, as such term is defined under Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this
evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control,
including the possibility of human error and the circumventions or overriding of controls. Consequently, even effective internal controls can only provide reasonable assurances with respect to any disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial statement preparation and presentation.  Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Rule13a-15f promulgated under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2006 based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2006, and that no material weaknesses have been identified.  Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2006 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is included herein.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting.On January5, 2006 we implemented a strategic reorganization of our business, including a reduction in workforce of 83 employees. We do not believe that any of these changes has materially affected, or
likely to materially effect, our internal control over financial reporting. Our CEO and CFO also evaluated whether any change had occurred in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the
Exchange Act during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on such evaluation, such officers have concluded that there was no
change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
105  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  The Board of Directors and Stockholders Diversa Corporation  We have
audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Diversa Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Diversa Corporations management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on
the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  A companys
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  In our opinion, managements assessment that Diversa Corporation
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Diversa Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets
as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive loss, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 and our report dated March 14,
2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon, and included an explanatory paragraph that highlighted a going concern uncertainty.  /s/ERNST YOUNG LLP  San Diego, California March 14, 2007

The material in this report is not soliciting material, is not deemed filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is not to be incorporated by
reference into any filing of Diversa under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.  Governance and Nominating Committee  The governance and nominating committee evaluates our corporate governance functions on behalf of the board of directors, including procedures for compliance with applicable legal, ethical, and regulatory requirements
that affect corporate governance, makes recommendations to the board of directors regarding governance issues, identifies, reviews, and evaluates candidates to serve as directors of Diversa, serves as a focal point for communication between such
candidates, the board of directors, and our management, and recommends such candidates to the board of directors. The governance and nominating committees primary responsibilities include assessment of the board of directors, conflicts of
interest assessment, corporate governance guidelines, procedures for information dissemination, and director nominations, board of directors committee nominations, and recommendations regarding director changes of position. The governance and
nominating committee was composed of Messrs. Cavanaugh, Johnson and Leschly. All members of the governance and nominating committee are independent, as independence is currently defined in Rule 4200a15 of the NASDAQ Stock Market listing
standards. The governance and nominating committee met four times during 2006.  The governance and nominating committee believes that candidates for director should possess certain minimum qualifications, including high personal integrity and ethics and the ability to understand basic financial
statements. The governance and nominating committee also considers factors such as relevant expertise upon which to be able to offer advice and guidance to management, sufficient time to devote to the affairs of Diversa, demonstrated excellence in
his or her field, experience in the markets Diversa serves, and the ability to exercise sound business judgment. However, the governance and nominating committee retains the right to modify these factors from time to time. Candidates for director
are reviewed in the context of the current composition of the board of directors, the operating requirements of Diversa, and the long-term interests of stockholders. In conducting this assessment, the governance and nominating committee considers
the current needs of the board of directors and Diversa, and seeks to maintain a balance of knowledge, experience and capability, and to avoid potential conflicts of interest. In the case of new director candidates, the governance and nominating
committee also determines whether a particular candidate must be independent for NASDAQ Stock Market purposes, which determination is based upon applicable NASDAQ Stock Market listing standards and applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules
and regulations. In the case of incumbent directors whose terms of office are set to expire, the governance and nominating committee reviews such directors overall service to Diversa during their term, including the number of meetings
attended, level of participation, quality of performance, and any other relationships and transactions that might impair such directors independence. 
111  At this time, the governance and nominating committee does not consider director candidates recommended
by stockholders. The governance and nominating committee believes that it is in the best position to identify, review, evaluate, and select qualified director candidates based upon its comprehensive criteria for board of directors membership. The
governance and nominating committee uses its network of contacts to compile a list of potential director candidates, but it may also engage, if it deems appropriate, a professional search firm. The governance and nominating committee conducts any
appropriate and necessary inquiries into the backgrounds and qualifications of possible candidates after considering the function and needs of the board.  Stockholder Communications with Diversas Board of Directors 
Stockholders and other parties interested in communicating directly with the non-management directors of Diversa as a group may do so by writing to the
Secretary of Diversa Corporation, 4955 Directors Place, San Diego, California 92121. Any communication must state the number of shares owned by the security holder making the communication. Effective September21, 2004, the Governance and
Nominating Committee of our board of directors approved a process for handling letters received by Diversa and addressed to non-management members of our board of directors. Under that process, the Secretary of Diversa reviews all such
correspondence and regularly forwards to our board of directors a summary of all such correspondence and copies of all correspondence that, in the opinion of the Secretary, deals with the functions of ourboard of directors or committees thereof or
that the Secretary otherwise determines requires their attention. If the Secretary determines that the communication is unduly hostile, threatening, or similarly inappropriate, the Secretary shall discard the communication. Directors may at any time
review a log of all correspondence received by Diversa that is addressed to members of the board of directors and request copies of any such correspondence. Concerns relating to accounting, internal controls, or auditing matters are immediately
brought to the attention of our accounting department and handled in accordance with procedures established by the audit committee with respect to such matters. There have been no material changes to the procedures under which security holders may
recommend nominees to the Companys Board of Directors.  Code of
Ethics  We have adopted the Diversa Corporation Code
of Business Conduct and Ethics, or Code of Conduct, that applies to all officers, directors and employees. The Code of Conduct is available on our website at  If we make any
substantive amendments to the Code of Conduct or grants any waiver from its provisions to any executive officer or director, we will promptly disclose the nature of the amendment or waiver on its website.
