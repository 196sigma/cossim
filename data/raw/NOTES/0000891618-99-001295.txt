REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Amkor Technology, Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amkor
Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1998, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of Anam Semiconductor,
Inc. ASI, the investment in which is reflected in the accompanying 1996 and
1997 financial statements using the equity method of accounting. The investment
in ASI represents 2% of total assets at December 31, 1997 and the equity in its
net loss represents 4% and 29% of net income before the equity in loss of ASI in
1996 and 1997, respectively. The statements of ASI were audited by other
auditors whose report has been furnished to us and our opinion, insofar as it
relates to amounts included for ASI, is based solely on the report of the other
auditors.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based upon our audits and the report of other auditors
regarding 1996 and 1997, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Amkor
Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1998, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
The report of the other auditors referred to above indicates that the
financial statements of ASI have been prepared assuming that ASI will continue
as a going concern. This report states that the operations of ASI have been
significantly affected, and will continue to be affected for the foreseeable
future, by Korea unstable economy caused by currency volatility and unstable
finance markets in Korea and that ASI has historically operated with a
significant amount of debt relative to its equity, had a significant working
capital deficit at December 31, 1997 and has contractually guaranteed the debt
obligations of certain affiliates and subsidiaries. These significant
uncertainties may affect ASI future operations and its ability to maintain or
refinance certain debt obligations as they mature, which raise substantial doubt
regarding ASI ability to continue as a going concern. ASI plans to address
these matters, which are disclosed in ASI financial statements, including
entering into the Korean financial restructuring program known as Workout in
October 1998. The Workout program is the result of an accord among Korean
financial institutions to assist in the restructuring of Korean business
enterprises and does not involve the judicial system. Finally, the report of
other auditors states that the ultimate outcome of these uncertainties cannot be
determined presently and ASI financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from these uncertainties.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amkor
Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company. All of the Company
subsidiaries are wholly owned except for a small number of shares of each of the
Company Philippine subsidiaries which are required to be owned by directors of
these companies pursuant to Philippine law.
The consolidated financial statements reflect the elimination of all
significant intercompany accounts and transactions.
The investments in, and the operating results of, 20% to 50% owned
companies are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity
method of accounting.
Prior to the Reorganization as defined below, the Company financial
statements were presented on a combined basis as a result of common ownership
and business operations of all the Amkor Companies as defined below, including
AK Industries, Inc. AKI. The Reorganization was treated similar to a pooling
of interests as it represented an exchange of equity interests among companies
under common control, except for the acquisition of AKI which was accounted for
as a purchase transaction. The purchase price for the AKI stock, which
represented the fair value of those shares, approximated the book value of AKI.
Reorganization
Prior to the Reorganization as defined herein the combined financial
statements of Amkor Technology, Inc. ATI and its subsidiaries and AKI and
its subsidiary included the accounts of the following based on the ownership
structure prior to the Reorganization these companies are referred to as the
Amkor Companies:
M Amkor Electronics, Inc. AEI, a U.S. S Corporation and its wholly
owned subsidiaries, Amkor Receivables Corp a U.S. Corporation and Amkor
Wafer Fabrication Services SARL a French Limited Company AWFS;
M T.L. Limited TLL a British Cayman Island Corporation and its
Philippine subsidiaries, Amkor Anam Advanced Packaging, Inc. AAAP
wholly owned and Amkor/Anam Pilipinas, Inc. AAP, which was owned
60% by TLL and 40% by Anam Semiconductor Inc. ASIwhich changed its
name in 1998 from Anam Industrial Co., Ltd. -- see Notes 6 and 14, and
its wholly-owned subsidiary Automated MicroElectronics, Inc. AMI;
M C.I.L., Limited CIL a British Cayman Islands Corporation and its
wholly-owned subsidiary Amkor/Anam Euroservices S.A.R.L. AAES a
French Corporation;
M Amkor Anam Test Services, Inc. a U.S. Corporation see Note 17;
M The semiconductor packaging and test business unit of Chamterry
Enterprises, Ltd. Chamterry. During the third quarter of 1997
Chamterry transferred its customers to AEI and CIL and ceased operations
of its semiconductor and test business unit; and
M AKI a U.S. Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Amkor-Anam,
Inc. a U.S. Corporation.
Prior to the Reorganization, all of the Amkor Companies were substantially
wholly owned by Mr. and Mrs. James Kim or entities controlled by members of Mr.
James Kim immediate family the Founding Stockholders, except for AAP which
was 40% owned by ASI and one third of AEI and all of AKI which were owned by
trusts established for the benefit of other members of Mr. James Kim family

Trusts. The Amkor Companies were an interdependent group of companies involved
in the same business under the direction of common management. ATI was formed in
September 1997 to facilitate the Reorganization and consolidate the ownership of
the Amkor Companies. In connection with the Reorganization, AEI was merged into
ATI. Amkor International Holdings AIH, a Cayman Islands holding company,
became a wholly owned subsidiary of ATI. AIH was formed to hold the following
entities: First Amkor Caymans, Inc. FACI, which was formed to hold AAAP, AAP
and its subsidiary AMI, TLL and its subsidiary CIL and CIL subsidiary AAES.
The relative number of shares of common stock issued by the Company in
connection with each of the transactions comprising the Reorganization was based
upon the relative amounts of stockholders' equity at December 31, 1997. On April
14, 1998, Mr. and Mrs. James Kim and the Kim Family Trusts received two-thirds
9,746,760 shares and one-third 4,873,380 shares of the ATI common stock then
outstanding, respectively. On April 29, 1998, ATI issued 67,989,851 shares of
common stock, representing approximately 82% of its shares immediately after the
Reorganization, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of AIH and its
subsidiaries. Of such shares, 27,528,234 shares and 36,376,617 shares were
gifted to Mr. and Mrs. James Kim and the Kim Family Trusts, respectively, such
that Mr. and Mrs. James Kim and the Kim Family Trusts owned 451% and 499 respectively, of the ATI common shares outstanding after the Reorganization.
Following such transactions the Founding Stockholders beneficially owned a
majority of the outstanding shares of ATI common stock. In addition, ATI
acquired all of the stock of AKI from the Kim Family Trusts for approximately
$3,000. The merger of AEI and ATI, the creation of AIH and FACI, the issuance of
ATI common stock for AIH and the acquisition of AKI are collectively referred to
as the Reorganization. See -- Income Taxes regarding change in AEI tax
status.
Nature of Operations
The Company provides semiconductor packaging and test services as well as
wafer fabrication services to semiconductor and computer manufacturers located
in strategic markets throughout the world. Such services are provided by the
Company and by ASI under a long-standing arrangement see Note 14.
Approximately 72%, 68% and 67% of the Company packaging and test revenues in
1996, 1997 and 1998 respectively, relate to the packaging and test services
provided by ASI. In addition, 100% of the Company wafer fabrication revenues
relate to the wafer fabrication services provided by ASI under a long-term
agreement see Note 14.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments, for which the Company is subject to credit risk,
consist principally of accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents. With
respect to accounts receivable, the Company has mitigated its credit risk by
selling primarily to well established companies, performing ongoing credit
evaluations and making frequent contact with customers.
The Company has mitigated its credit risk with respect to cash and cash
equivalents through diversification of its portfolio of cash holdings into
various money market accounts, U.S. treasury bonds, federal mortgage backed
securities, and high grade municipal and commercial loans. At December 31, 1998,
the Company maintained approximately $35,000 in six high grade municipal and
commercial loans, with the largest individual loan balance of approximately
$10,000. However, at December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, the Company maintained
approximately $14,649, $34,622 and $29,303, respectively, in deposits and
certificates of deposits at foreign owned banks and $1,861, $2,548 and $4,406,
respectively, in deposits at U.S. banks which exceeded federally insured limits.

Significant Customers
The Company has a number of major customers in North America, Asia and
Europe. The Company largest customer, Intel Corporation, accounted for
approximately 235%, 234% and 206% of net revenues in 1996, 1997 and 1998,
respectively. The Company five largest customers collectively accounted for
392%, 401% and 416% of net revenues in 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively. The
Company anticipates that significant customer concentration will continue for
the foreseeable future, although the companies which constitute the Company
largest customers may change.
Risks and Uncertainties
The Company future results of operations involve a number of risks and
uncertainties. Factors that could affect the Company future operating results
and cause actual results to vary materially from historical results include, but
are not limited to, dependence on the highly cyclical nature of both the
semiconductor and the personal computer industries, competitive pricing and
declines in average selling prices, dependence on the Company relationship
with ASI see Note 14, reliance on a small group of principal customers, timing
and volume of orders relative to the Company production capacity, availability
of manufacturing capacity and fluctuations in manufacturing yields, availability
of financing, competition, dependence on international operations and sales,
dependence on raw material and equipment suppliers, exchange rate fluctuations,
dependence on key personnel, difficulties in managing growth, enforcement of
intellectual property rights, environmental regulations and results of ASI on an
equity accounting basis, assuming we make the $150,000 investment in ASI
because we will be required to record our proportional ownership interest in
ASI earnings or losses.
Foreign Currency Translation
Substantially all of the Company foreign subsidiaries use the U.S. dollar
as their functional currency. Accordingly, monetary assets and liabilities which
were originally denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S.
dollars at month-end exchange rates. Non-monetary items which were originally
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at historical rates. Gains and
losses from such remeasurement and from transactions denominated in foreign
currencies are included in other income expense, net. The cumulative
translation adjustment reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income in
stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets related primarily to
investments in unconsolidated companies which used the local currency as the
functional currency see Note 6.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of
three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
Accounts Receivable
At December 31, 1997 and 1998, trade accounts receivable represent the
Company interest in receivables in excess of amounts purchased by banks under
an accounts receivable sale agreement see Note 3. Of the total net trade
accounts receivable amount at December 31, 1997 and 1998, $19,905 and $22,488,
respectively relates to the trade accounts receivable of CIL which were not sold
under the Agreement.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
principally by using a moving average method.

Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is
calculated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
depreciable assets. Accelerated methods are used for tax purposes. Depreciable
lives follow:
Buildings and  10 to 30 years
Machinery and   3 to 5 years
Furniture, fixtures and other   3 to 10 years
Cost and accumulated depreciation for property retired or disposed of are
removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in
earnings. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred. Depreciation expense was $58,497, $81,159 and $116,424 for 1996, 1997
and 1998, respectively.
Other Noncurrent Assets
Other noncurrent assets consist principally of goodwill, deferred debt
issuance costs, security deposits, deferred income taxes and the cash surrender
value of life insurance policies.
The Company recorded goodwill representing the excess of cost over the book
value of minority interest in AAP see Note 17. Goodwill is amortized on a
straight-line basis over a period of ten years which is the estimated future
period to be benefited by the acquisition.
In connection with the $207,000 offering of Convertible Notes see Note 2
the Company incurred approximately $9,100 of debt issuance costs which have been
deferred and are amortized and reflected as interest expense over the life of
the Convertible Notes.
Other Noncurrent Liabilities
Other noncurrent liabilities consist primarily of pension obligations and
noncurrent income taxes payable.
Stock Compensation Plans
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans in accordance
with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. Accordingly, compensation cost for stock based plans is generally
measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the Company
stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire
the stock. Disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 123 are presented in Note 13.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes following the provisions of SFAS No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires the use of the liability
method. If it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax
asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is provided.
The Company reports certain income and expense items for income tax
purposes on a basis different from that reflected in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements. The principal differences relate to the
timing of the recognition of accrued expenses which are not deductible for
federal income tax purposes until paid, the use of accelerated methods of
depreciation for income tax purposes and unrecognized foreign exchange gains and
losses.

AEI elected to be taxed as an S Corporation under the provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and comparable state tax provisions. As a result,
AEI did not recognize U.S. federal corporate income taxes. Instead, the
stockholders of AEI were taxed on their proportionate share of AEI taxable
income. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal income taxes was recorded for
AEI. The accompanying consolidated statements of income include an unaudited pro
forma adjustment to reflect income taxes which would have been recorded if AEI
had not been an S Corporation, based on the tax laws in effect during the
respective periods see -- Reorganization.
Just prior to the Offerings see Note 2, AEI terminated its S Corporation
status at which point the profits of AEI became subject to federal and state
income taxes at the corporate level.
Revenue Recognition and Risk of Loss
The Company records revenues upon shipment of packaged semiconductors to
its customers. The Company does not take ownership of customer-supplied
semiconductors. Title and risk of loss remains with the customer for these
materials at all times. Accordingly, the cost of the customer-supplied materials
is not included in the consolidated financial statements. Risk of loss for the
Company packaging costs passes upon completion of the packaging process and
shipment to the customer. In regards to wafer fabrication services, the Company
records revenues upon shipment of completed wafers to its customers.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative
instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability
measured at its fair value. SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the
derivative fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific
hedge accounting criteria are met. Special accounting for qualifying hedges
allows a derivative gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged
item in the income statement, and requires that a company must formally
document, designate, and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive
hedge accounting.
SFAS No. 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999.
Early adoption at the beginning of any quarter after issuance is permitted, but
cannot be applied retroactively. The provisions of the statement must be applied
to derivative instruments and certain derivative instruments embedded in hybrid
contracts that were issued, acquired, or substantively modified after December
31, 1997.
The Company believes that the impact of adopting SFAS No. 133 on its
financial statements will not be material and has not determined the timing of
adoption.

2. INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
On May 6, 1998, the Company completed its Initial Public Offering of
30,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $1100 per
share and $180,000 aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes Initial
Public Offering or Offerings. Also on May 8, 1998, the Company sold
5,250,000 additional shares of its common stock and $27,000 additional principal
amounts of Convertible Notes in conjunction with the underwriters'
over-allotment options. The net proceeds were approximately $558,121, after
deducting the underwriter discounts and offering expenses. The convertible notes
1 are convertible into the Company common stock at $1350 per share; 2 are
callable in certain circumstances after three years; 3 are unsecured and
subordinate to senior debt; 4 carry a coupon rate of 5 3/4%; and 5 mature at
the end of five years. Approximately $264,000 of the proceeds were used to
reduce short-term and long-term borrowings. Approximately $86,000 of the
proceeds were used to reduce amounts due to Anam USA, Inc., ASI wholly owned
financing subsidiary AUSA. Approximately $34,000 of the proceeds was used to
purchase ASI 40% interest in AAP. See Note 17. In connection with the
Offerings, one existing stockholder sold approximately 5,000,000 of his shares.
3. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SALE AGREEMENT
Effective July 7, 1997, the Company entered into an agreement to sell
receivables the Agreement with certain banks the Purchasers. The
transaction qualifies as a sale under the provisions of SFAS No. 125 Accounting
For Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities. Under the Agreement, the Purchasers have committed to purchase,
with limited recourse, all right, title and interest in selected accounts
receivable of the Company, up to a maximum of $100,000. In connection with the
Agreement, the Company established a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary,
Amkor Receivables Corp., to purchase accounts receivable at a discount from the
Company on a continuous basis, subject to certain limitations as described in
the Agreement. Amkor Receivables Corp. simultaneously sells the accounts
receivable at the same discount to the Purchasers. The Agreement is structured
as a three year facility subject to annual renewals based upon the mutual
consent of the Company and purchasers. Prior to December 31, 1997, the Company
applied approximately $83,400 of the Receivables Sale proceeds together with
approximately $17,000 of working capital to reduce the Company indebtedness to
AUSA which amounts were advanced by AUSA to entities controlled by members of
James Kim family.
The first annual renewal under the Agreement was effective December 30,
1998 and the next renewal date is December 29, 1999. ASI had guaranteed the
Company obligations under the agreement See Note 14, however, ASI was
released from its obligations as guarantor effective December 30, 1998.
Proceeds, net of reduction in selected accounts receivable from the sale of
receivables were $84,400 in 1997 which has decreased by $12,900 during 1998 due
to a further reduction in selected accounts receivable. Losses on receivables
sold under the Agreement were approximately $2,414 and $4,693 in 1997 and 1998,
respectively and are included in other expense, net. As of December 31, 1997 and
1998, approximately $6,300 and $2,700, respectively, is included in current
liabilities for amounts to be refunded to the Purchasers as a result of a
reduction in selected accounts receivable.

On October 21, 1998, the Company announced that it entered into a joint
venture, Taiwan Semiconductor Technology Corporation TSTC, with Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, Acer Inc., United Test Center and
Chinfon Semiconductor & Technology Company. TSTC, which is expected to commence
operations during the first quarter of 1999, will provide independent advanced
integrated circuit IC packaging services primarily for the Taiwan market and
Taiwan foundry output. The Company plans to invest an estimated total of $40,000
in TSTC. In October 1998, the Company invested $10,000 as part of
57

AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

the second round of joint venture financing. In December, 1998, the Company
purchased additional TSTC shares from ASI for $10,000 which represented ASI
investment as part of the joint venture initial round of financing in which
ATI did not participate. ASI did not participate in the joint venture second
round of financing. As of December 31, 1998 the Company owns approximately a 25%
interest in TSTC and accordingly, the Company investment in TSTC is accounted
for using the equity method of accounting.
The Company investment in ASI was accounted for using the equity method
of accounting. Although the Company did not own in excess of 20% of the
outstanding common stock of ASI, the Company, through its common ownership with
the Kim family and entities controlled by the Kim family, owned 407% of the
outstanding common stock of ASI at December 31, 1997 and could have exercised a
significant influence over ASI. Accordingly the Company applied the equity
method based on its ownership interest.
In 1997, the Company recognized a loss of $17,291, resulting principally
from the impairment of value of its investment in ASI as well as the Company
equity in loss of ASI for the year ended December 31, 1997. The amount of the
impairment loss was determined based upon the market value of the ASI shares on
the Korean Stock Exchange on February 16, 1998, the date that the Company sold
its investment in ASI common stock to AK Investments, Inc., an entity owned by
James J. Kim. In exchange for the shares, AK Investments, Inc. assumed $13,863
of the Company long-term borrowings from Anam USA, Inc.
ASI independent auditors' report indicates that the financial statements
of ASI have been prepared assuming that ASI will continue as a going concern.
ASI business has been severely affected by the economic crisis in Korea. ASI
has traditionally operated with a significant amount of debt relative to its
equity and had a significant working capital deficit at December 31, 1997 and
has contractually guaranteed the debt obligations of certain affiliates and
subsidiaries. These significant uncertainties may affect ASI future operations
and its ability to maintain or refinance certain debt obligations as they
mature, which raise substantial doubt regarding ASI ability to continue as a
going concern. ASI plans to address these matters, which are disclosed in
ASI financial statements, include entering into the Korean financial
restructuring program known as Workout in October 1998. The Workout program is
the result of an accord among Korean financial institutions to assist in the
restructuring of Korean business enterprises and does not involve the judicial
system. The ultimate outcome of these uncertainties cannot be determined
presently and ASI financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from these uncertainties. See Note 14 for more information
regarding the Workout.
ASI financial statements are prepared on the basis of Korean GAAP, which
differs from U.S. GAAP in certain significant respects. The Company equity in
loss of ASI is based upon the Korean GAAP information noted above and the
Company estimate of significant U.S. GAAP adjustments. These adjustments were
not significant in 1996. In 1997, ASI recognized a W349 billion loss principally
as a result of foreign exchange losses on U.S. dollar denominated liabilities
due to the significant depreciation of the won relative to the U.S. dollar. For
purposes of determining the Company equity in loss of ASI under U.S. GAAP,
losses on remeasuring U.S. dollar denominated liabilities are not recognized as
the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for ASI. Such U.S. dollar denominated
liabilities were W2,144 billion at December 31, 1997. Also, at December 31,
1997, the carrying value of the investment in ASI, adjusted for the loss on the
1998 disposition discussed above, is less than the Company portion of ASI
net assets after consideration of the estimated U.S. GAAP adjustments. The most
significant such adjustment affecting net assets is the remeasurement of
property, plant and equipment to historical costs as required as the U.S. dollar
is the functional currency.

7. SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES
At December 31, 1997 and 1998, short-term borrowings consisted of various
operating lines of credit and working capital facilities maintained by the
Company. These borrowings are secured by receivables, inventories or property.
These facilities, which are typically for one-year renewable terms, generally
bear interest at current market rates appropriate for the country in which the
borrowing is made ranging from 1125% to 160% at December 31, 1998. For 1997
and 1998, the weighted average interest rate on these borrowings was 86% and
119%, respectively. Included in cash and cash equivalents is $11,200 of
certificates of deposit pledged as collateral for certain of these lines. The
unused portion of lines of credit total $54,077 at December 31, 1998.

The Bank loans were obtained to finance the expansion of the Company
factories in the Philippines. The Company had the option to prepay all or part
of the loans on any interest payment date. These Bank loans were unconditionally
and irrevocably guaranteed by ASI. The Bank loans contained provisions
pertaining to the maintenance of specified debt-to-equity ratios, restrictions
with respect to corporate reorganization, acquisition of capital stock or
substantially all of the assets of any other corporations and advances and
dispositions of all or a substantial portion of the borrower assets, except in
the ordinary course of business. AAP was not in compliance with covenants
regarding the maintenance of certain debt-to-equity ratios and advances to
affiliates at December 31, 1997. As a result of the receipt of the net proceeds
from the Initial Public Offering see Note 2, amounts due under these
agreements, certain other agreements with cross-default clauses and $42,500 of
short-term borrowings which were refinanced were classified as non-current
liabilities at December 31, 1997 in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
Other bank debt instruments have interest rates based on Singapore
interbank rates and LIBOR plus an annual spread. The loans are secured by assets
of the Company including assets acquired through proceeds from the loans.

U.S. Defined Contribution Plan
ATI has a defined contribution benefit plan covering substantially all U.S.
employees under which employees can contribute up to 13% of salary to the plan
and ATI matches 75% of the employee contributions up to a defined maximum on
an annual basis. The expense for this plan was $776, $959 and $1,394 in 1996,
1997 and 1998, respectively.
Philippine Pension Plan
AAAP, AAP and AMI sponsor a defined benefit plan that covers substantially
all employees who are not covered by statutory plans. Charges to expense are
based upon costs computed by independent actuaries.
During 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 132 Employers' Disclosures about
Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. The provisions of SFAS No. 132
revise employers' disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefit
plans. It does not change the measurement or recognition of this plan.
The components of net periodic pension cost for the defined benefit plan
are as follows:
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
1996   1997   1998
Service cost of current period. $1,542  $1,274  $1,618

10. INCOME TAXES
The provision for income taxes includes federal, state and foreign taxes
currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between
the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. The
components of the provision for income taxes follow:
FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

The Company has structured its global operations to take advantage of lower
tax rates in certain countries and tax incentives extended to encourage
investment. AAAP has a tax holiday in the Philippines which expires at the end
of 2002. Foreign exchange losses/gains recognized for income taxes relate to
unrecognized net foreign exchange losses/gains on U.S. dollar denominated
monetary assets and liabilities. These losses/gains, which are not recognized
for financial reporting purposes as the U.S. dollar is the functional currency
see Note 1, result in deferred tax assets that will be realized, for
Philippine tax reporting purposes, upon settlement of the related asset or
liability. The net deferred tax asset related to these losses increased in 1997
as a result of the dramatic devaluation of the Philippine peso relative to the
U.S. dollar. These assets decreased in 1998 as they were realized for Philippine
tax reporting purposes. The Company ability to utilize these assets depends on
the timing of the settlement of the related assets or liabilities and the amount
of taxable income recognized within the Philippine statutory carryforward limit
of three years.

Accordingly, a valuation allowance was established for a portion of the related
deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 1998, foreign net operating loss
carryforwards of $11,050 are available to offset future foreign income through
2001. In addition, minimum corporate income tax credits of $1,182 are available
to offset future foreign tax obligations through 2001.
The following is a summary of the significant components of the Company
deferred tax assets and liabilities:

Non-U.S. income before taxes and minority interest of the Company was
$20,420, $32,920 and $53,937 in 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively.
The company does not pay or record U.S. income taxes on the undistributed
earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as long as those earnings are permanently
reinvested in the companies that produced them. These cumulative undistributed
earnings are included in consolidated retained earnings on the balance sheet and
amounted to approximately $37,000 as of December 31, 1998. An estimated $12,000
in U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes would be due if these earnings were
remitted as dividends.
At December 31, 1997 and 1998 current deferred tax assets of $13,439 and
$9,838, respectively, are included in other current assets and noncurrent
deferred tax assets of $574 and $2,925, respectively, are included in other
assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company net deferred tax assets
include amounts which, in the opinion of management, are more likely than not to
be realizable through future taxable income.
The Company tax returns have been examined through 1993 in the
Philippines and through 1994 in the U.S. The tax returns for open years are
subject to changes upon final examination of these. Changes in the mix of income
from the Company foreign subsidiaries, expiration of tax holidays and changes
in tax laws or regulations could result in increased effective tax rates for the
Company.
In connection with the Initial Public Offering, the Company and the
stockholders of AEI entered into a Tax Indemnification Agreement providing that
the Company and AEI will be indemnified by such stockholders, with respect to
their proportionate share of any federal or state corporate income taxes
64

AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

EXCEPT SHARE AND DOLLAR PER SHARE DATA
attributable to the failure of AEI to qualify as an S Corporation for any period
or in any jurisdiction for which S Corporation status was claimed through the
date AEI terminated its S Corporation status. The Tax Indemnification Agreement
provides that the Company and AEI will indemnify the stockholders if such
stockholders are required to include in income additional amounts attributable
to taxable years on or before the date AEI terminated its S Corporation status
as to which AEI filed or files tax returns claiming status as an S Corporation.
Prior to AEI termination of its S Corporation status, Mr. and Mrs. James
Kim and the Kim Family Trusts had been obligated to pay U.S. federal and certain
state income taxes on their allocable portion of AEI income. AEI has made
various distributions to Mr. and Mrs. Kim and the Kim Family Trusts which have
enabled them to pay these income taxes. Upon finalization of the AEI tax
returns, approximately $3,000 of these distributions will be refunded to the
Company.
11. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
The common stock and additional paid-in-capital of the Company are
reflected at the original cost of the Amkor Companies. In connection with the
Reorganization see Note 1, the Company authorized 500,000,000 shares of $001
par value common stock, of which 82,610,000 shares were issued to the
stockholders of the Amkor Companies in exchange for their interests in these
Companies.
At the date of the Reorganization consolidated retained earnings included
$3,243 related to AKI. This amount is reflected as a reduction in retained
earnings in 1998 as a result of the purchase of AKI by the Company.
In addition, the Company authorized 10,000,000 shares of $001 par value
preferred stock, designated as Series A.
Changes in the division equity account reflected in the consolidated
statement of stockholders' equity represent the net cash flows resulting from
the operations of the Chamterry semiconductor packaging and test business for
the periods indicated. Such cash flows have been presented as distributions or
capital contributions since these amounts were retained in Chamterry
Enterprises, Ltd. for the benefit of the owners.
The line items included in Other Comprehensive Income, as presented in the
Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity, relate to S Corporation
activity prior to 1998. Accordingly, the related amounts reflected in Other
Comprehensive Income and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the
Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity and the Consolidated Balance
Sheets are net of taxes at an effective tax rate of 0%.
12. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Net income per common share was calculated by dividing net income and pro
forma net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the
respective periods, adjusted for the effect of the Reorganization see Note 1
and the Initial Public Offering see Note 2.
In 1997, the Company adopted SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, which
requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share on the face
of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed using only the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding for the period while diluted EPS is computed
assuming conversion of all dilutive securities, such as options. In accordance
with the statement, all prior period per share amounts were revised to reflect
this presentation. Both the Company basic and diluted as

A summary of the weighted average fair value of options at grant date
granted during the year ended December 31, 1998 follows:
WEIGHTED AVERAGE  WEIGHTED AVERAGE
NUMBER OF  EXERCISE PRICE    GRANT DATE
SHARES    PER SHARE     FAIR VALUES
Options whose exercise price is greater
than the market price on grant date.   42,600    $1100       $222

Options whose exercise price is less than
the market price on grant date.   30,000    $1034       $497
In order to calculate the fair value of stock options at date of grant, the
Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following assumptions
were used: expected option term -- 4 years, stock price volatility
factor -- 47%, dividend yield -- 0%, and risk free interest rate -- 538%.
1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company 1998 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in
January 1998 and was approved by the stockholders in April 1998. A total of
1,000,000 shares of common stock have been made available for sale under the
Purchase Plan and an annual increase is to be added on each anniversary date of
the adoption of the Purchase Plan. Employees including officers and employee
directors of the Company but excluding 5% or greater stockholders are eligible
to participate if they are customarily employed for at least 20 hours per week
and for more than five months in any calendar year. The Purchase Plan permits
eligible employees to purchase common stock through payroll deductions, which
may not exceed 15% of the compensation an employee receives on each payday. The
initial offering period began on October 1, 1998 with a seven-month offering
period. All subsequent offering periods will be consecutive six-month periods
beginning on May 1, 1999, subject to change by the Board of Directors. Each
participant will be granted an option on the first day of an offering period,
and shares of Common Stock will be automatically purchased on the last date of
each offering period. The purchase price of the Common Stock under the Purchase
Plan will be equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value per share of
Common Stock on the start date of the offering period or on the purchase date.
Employees may end their participation in an offering period at any time, and
participation ends automatically on termination of employment with the Company.
The Purchase Plan will terminate in January 2008, unless sooner terminated by
the Board of Directors.
Under the Purchase Plan, the Company has withheld approximately $600
through payroll deductions as of December 31, 1998. The fair market value per
share of the Company common stock was $456 on October 1, 1998, the start date
of the first offering period. The fair value of the purchase rights granted
during 1998 was $129 which was estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing
model with the following assumptions: expected option term -- 7 months, stock
price volatility factor -- 47%, dividend yield -- 0% and risk free interest
rate -- 431%.
The Company accounts for its stock compensation plans as prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and its related interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation cost
has been recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Had the Company
recorded compensation expense for its stock compensation plans, as provided by
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company reported
net income and basic and diluted earnings per

14. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
At December 31, 1997, the Company owned 81% of the outstanding stock of
ASI see Note 6, and ASI owned 40% of AAP. On February 16, 1998, the Company
sold its investment in ASI common stock for $13,863 to AK Investments, Inc.
based on the market value of ASI shares on the Korean Stock Exchange. On June 1,
1998 the Company purchased ASI interest in AAP for approximately $34,000 see
Note 17. In 1996, 1997, and 1998, approximately 72%, 68% and 67%, respectively,
of the Company packaging and test revenues as well as 100% of the Company
wafer fabrication revenues see Note 1 were derived from services performed for
the Company by ASI, a Korean public company in which certain of the Company
principal stockholders hold a minority interest. By the terms of a long-standing
agreement, the Company has been responsible for marketing and selling ASI
semiconductor packaging and test services, except to customers in Korea and
Japan to whom ASI has historically sold such services directly. During 1998, the
Company became responsible for marketing and selling ASI semiconductor
packaging and test services to the majority of ASI customers in Japan. The
Company has worked closely with ASI in developing new technologies and products.
Effective January 1, 1998, the Company entered into five-year supply agreements
with ASI giving the Company the first right to market and sell substantially all
of ASI packaging and test services and the exclusive right to market and sell
all of the wafer output of ASI new wafer foundry, both of which have
negotiable pricing terms. These agreements are cancellable by either party upon
five years prior written notice at any time after the fifth anniversary of the
effective date. The Company business, financial condition and operating
results have been and will continue to be significantly dependent on the ability
of ASI to effectively provide the contracted services on a cost-efficient and
timely basis. The termination of the Company relationship with ASI for any
reason, or any material adverse change in ASI business resulting from
underutilization of its capacity, the level of its debt and its guarantees of
affiliate debt, labor disruptions, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates,
changes in governmental policies, economic or political conditions in Korea or
any other change could have a material adverse effect on the Company business,
financial condition and results of operations.
The Company previously met a significant portion of its financing from
financing arrangements provided by AUSA. A majority of the amount due to AUSA
represented outstanding amounts under financing obtained by AUSA for the benefit
of the Company with the balance representing payables to AUSA for packaging and
69
72
AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS,
EXCEPT SHARE AND DOLLAR PER SHARE DATA
test service charges and wafer fabrication service charges from ASI. Based on
guarantees provided by ASI, AUSA obtained for the benefit of the Company a
continuous series of short-term financing arrangements which generally were less
than six months in duration, and typically were less than two months in
duration. Because of the short-term nature of these loans, the flows of cash to
and from AUSA under this arrangement were significant. Purchases from ASI
through AUSA were $460,282, $527,858 and $573,791 for 1996, 1997 and 1998,
respectively. Charges from AUSA for interest and bank charges were $7,074 6,002 and $2,215 for 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively. Excluding the $20,000
balance due from ASI at December 31, 1998 for prepaid wafer foundry service
charges see discussion below, the net amounts payable to ASI and AUSA were
$156,350 and $8,357 at December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively.
ASI ability to continue to provide services to the Company will depend on
ASI financial condition and performance. ASI currently has a significant
amount of debt relative to its equity, which debt the Company expects will
continue to increase in the foreseeable future. The Company is advised that ASI
has published its most recent annual unconsolidated financial statements as of
December 31, 1998. These unconsolidated financial statements are prepared on the
basis of Korean GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP financial
statements are not available See Note 6. As of December 31, 1998, ASI, on an
unconsolidated basis, had current liabilities of approximately W1,716 billion,
including approximately W924 billion of short-term borrowings and approximately
W214 billion of current maturities of long-term debt, and had long-term
liabilities of approximately W1,182 billion, including approximately W448
billion of long-term debt and approximately W655 billion of long-term capital
lease obligations. As of such date, the total shareholders' equity of ASI
amounted to approximately W164 billion. ASI business has been severely
affected by the economic crisis in Korea. In late 1997, the Republic of Korea
began to undergo a foreign currency liquidity crisis resulting in significant
adverse economic circumstances and significant depreciation in the value of the
Korea Won against the U.S. dollar. ASI historically operated with a significant
amount of debt relative to its equity. The economic crisis in Korea led to
sharply higher interest rates and significantly reduced opportunities for
refinancing maturing debts. Because ASI maintained a substantial amount of
short-term debt, its inability to refinance this debt created a liquidity crisis
for ASI.
As of December 31, 1998, ASI was contingently liable under guarantees in
respect of debt of its non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates in the
aggregate amount of approximately W668 billion. As of December 31, 1998, such
guarantees included those in respect of all of AUSA debt totaling
approximately $225,000. Prior to the Initial Public Offering, the Company met a
significant portion of its financing needs through financing arrangements
obtained by AUSA for the benefit of the Company based on guarantees provided by
ASI. The Company currently does not depend on such financing arrangements. In
addition, if any relevant subsidiaries or affiliates of ASI were to fail to make
interest or principal payments or otherwise default under their debt obligations
guaranteed by ASI, ASI could be required under its guarantees to repay such
debt, which event could have a material adverse effect on its financial
condition and results of operations.
In response to this situation, in October 1998, ASI announced that it had
applied for and was accepted into the Korean financial restructuring program
known as Workout. The Workout program is the result of an accord among Korean
financial institutions to assist in the restructuring of Korean business
enterprises. This process involves negotiation between the related banks and
ASI, and does not involve the judicial system. The Workout process also does not
impact debts outstanding with trade creditors, including balances due to/or from
the Company. ASI operations have continued uninterrupted during the process,
and we expect ASI operations to continue uninterrupted for the duration of the
process.
The Company has received the report of the meeting of ASI creditor banks
at which the principal terms of a workout plan for ASI were approved. We
understand from ASI management that many of the details of the Workout program
will be contained in definitive agreements between ASI and the creditor banks
and none
70

EXCEPT SHARE AND DOLLAR PER SHARE DATA
of these agreements have yet been finalized. The terms of ASI Workout set
forth below are based upon the reported information provided to us by ASI
management. References to won or W are to the currency of Korea.
The Workout as approved by the creditor banks contains the following relief
provisions for ASI:
N The creditor banks will allow ASI to defer repayment on principal of
ordinary loans until December 31, 2003. After December 31, 2003, bank
loans with repayment terms will be payable through readjustment of
repayment schedules on the basis of the repayment period as of October
24, 1998. For loans without repayment terms the schedule to repay
principal amounts will be determined by ASI and the creditor banks at the
end of such period.
N The creditor banks will allow ASI to defer repayment of principal under
capital leases until December 31, 1999, with payments of principal to
resume under a 7 year installment plan thereafter.
N The creditor banks will allow ASI to roll over the maturity of its
Won-denominated debentures held by the creditor banks for an additional
three year term after currently scheduled maturity dates.
N The creditor banks will allow ASI to make no interest payments on
ordinary loans until December 31, 1999. The creditor banks will add
accrued interest to the principal amounts of these loans every three
months.
N The creditor banks will reduce interest rates on ASI remaining
outstanding Won-denominated ordinary bank loans to 10% or the prime rate
of each creditor bank, whichever is greater. This would reduce ASI
weighted average interest rate from 129% before the Workout to 105%
after the Workout.
N The creditor banks will give ASI a five year grace period until December
31, 2003 against enforcement of guarantees made by ASI for liabilities of
ASI affiliates. In addition, interest will not accrue on guaranteed
obligations during the five year period.
N The creditor banks will provide to ASI a short-term loan of W50 billion
at the prime rate plus 1%, to be repaid with proceeds from the sale of
K4.
N The creditor banks will convert W250 billion $208,000, using the
December 31, 1998 exchange rate of W1207 to $100 of ASI debt held by
the creditor banks into: 1 W1223 billion $102,000 using the December
31, 1998 exchange rate in equity shares of ASI, 2 W1081 billion
$90,000 using the December 31, 1998 exchange rate in five-year
non-interest bearing convertible debt and 3 W196 billion $16,000 in
non-interest bearing loans. The conversion would take place in
installments over four years and at a conversion rate equal to W5,000 per
share, the par value of ASI common stock. In order for the initial
conversion of debt to take place in accordance with the terms of the
Workout, ASI will have to undergo a series of corporate actions,
including a reverse stock split to bring the fair market value of its
equity shares to a price at least equal to the par value of such shares.
The creditor banks would time their conversions of ASI debt to coincide
with equity investments made in ASI by a third-party foreign investor
company, in the aggregate amount of $150,000 over a four year period.
The conversion of debt by the creditor banks depends upon ASI obtaining a
commitment from a third party foreign investor to invest $150,000 in ASI equity
over a four-year period. We have sent a letter to ASI creditor banks
committing, subject to certain conditions, to make an investment of $41,000 in
1999 and, assuming certain additional conditions are met, we will invest an
additional $109,000 between years 2000 and 2002. As a result of our commitment
to invest, ASI agreed to reduce the K4 purchase price from $607,000 to $582,000.
Our letter to ASI creditor banks committing to an investment in ASI is
contingent upon completion of the acquisition of K4, the continuation of the
Workout plan as approved, the continued
71
74
AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS,
EXCEPT SHARE AND DOLLAR PER SHARE DATA
effectiveness of our Supply Agreements with Anam and coordination of proposed
equity investments with the conversion by the creditor banks of their ASI debt
to equity. Our commitment letter provides that upon meeting these conditions, we
would invest $41,000 in 1999, 2000, and 2001 with a final investment of $27,000
in 2002. We would purchase the ASI shares at W5,000 per share. Since our
commitment is in U.S. dollars, the number of shares we would purchase will vary
based on the exchange rate of Korean won to U.S. dollars. The letter has not yet
been accepted by ASI creditor banks and we cannot be certain that the banks
will agree to the terms we have proposed for the investment. Our commitment to
invest in ASI must be finalized before the Workout agreements will be
implemented. If the Company reaches an agreement with ASI creditor banks on
the terms of Amkor commitment, ASI has indicated that it will reduce the K4
purchase price to $582 million from $607 million. The Company does not believe
that any other third party is considering investing in ASI.
ASI has not finalized the Workout agreement with the creditor banks.
Assuming the creditor banks and ASI finalize and implement the Workout, upon
completion of the first installment of the conversion of debt of the creditor
banks to equity or convertible debt and the first installment of our equity
investment, the relative equity of ownership of ASI among the creditor banks,
the Kim family and the Company would be approximately 27%, 21% and 21 respectively assuming an exchange rate of W1200 to $100 and without any
future sales of ASI stock by these parties. Upon completion of all debt
conversions and equity investments contemplated by the Workout through 2002, the
relative equity ownership of ASI among the creditor banks, the Kim family and
the Company would be approximately 29%, 11% and 43%, respectively assuming an
exchange rate of W1,200 to $100 and without any future sales of ASI stock by
these parties. Upon conversion of all of the convertible debt issued to
creditor banks, which would be permitted beginning one year after the date of
issuance of such debt, the ownership of ASI among the creditor banks, the Kim
family and our company would be approximately 43%, 9% and 34%, respectively
assuming an exchange rate of W1,200 to $100 and without any future sales of
ASI stock by these parties.
The creditor banks have the right to terminate the Workout if ASI fails to
meet the conditions of the Workout, which includes conditions related to ASI
financial performance. We believe that if the Workout is not finalized by the
creditor banks and ASI or if the creditor banks subsequently terminate the
Workout, the debt relief afforded to ASI pursuant to the Workout would be
terminated, and the creditor banks could reinstate and enforce the original
terms of ASI debt, including accelerating ASI obligations. If this were to
occur, ASI and our businesses could be harmed.
There can be no assurance that ASI will be able to satisfy the terms of the
proposed Workout Agreement. Any inability of ASI to comply with the terms of the
proposed Workout Agreement, generate cash flow from operations sufficient to
fund its capital expenditures and other working capital and liquidity
requirements could have a material adverse effect on ASI ability to continue
to provide services and otherwise fulfill its obligations to the Company.
As previously discussed, the Company incurs charges from ASI for assembly
and test services performed on a monthly basis. Historically the Company has
paid ASI for these services on net 30-day terms. On July 21, 1998 the Company
entered into a prepayment agreement with ASI relating to assembly and test
services. In accordance with the agreement, the Company made a $50,000
non-interest bearing advance to ASI, representing approximately one month
charges for assembly and test services. The Company offset this advance against
billings by ASI for assembly and test services provided in the fourth quarter of
1998. During the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company has reduced this advance to
ASI in full by offsetting the balance against amounts due to ASI for fourth
quarter packaging and test services.
In connection with its wafer foundry agreement with Texas Instruments, Inc.
TI, the Company and TI agreed to revise certain payment and other terms
contained in the Master Purchase Agreement entered
72
75
AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS,
EXCEPT SHARE AND DOLLAR PER SHARE DATA
into during 1998 Master Purchase Agreement. As part of this agreement, TI
agreed to advance the Company $20,000 in June 1998 and an additional $20,000 in
December 1998, as prepayments of wafer foundry services to be provided in the
fourth quarter of 1998 and first quarter of 1999, respectively. The Company
recorded these amounts in accrued expenses. The Company in turn advanced these
funds to ASI as prepayments for foundry service charges. The Company has fully
offset the $20,000 advance made in June 1998 against billings by ASI in the
fourth quarter of 1998. The December 1998 advance is reflected in the current
portion of Due from Affiliates as of December 31, 1998. As of February 28, 1999,
the December 1998 advance from TI and the related advance to ASI have both been
reduced to $6,640. The Company expects both advances to be fully repaid by the
end of the first quarter of 1999.
To facilitate capacity expansion for new product lines, certain customers
advanced the Company funds to purchase certain equipment to fulfill such
customers forecasts. In certain cases, the customer has requested that the
equipment be installed in the ASI factories. In these cases, the Company
receives funds from the customer and advances the funds to ASI. ASI in turn
purchases the necessary equipment. ASI repays the Company through a reduction of
the monthly processing charges related to the customer product being assembled.
The Company will reduce its obligation to the customer through a reduction in
the accounts receivable, due from the customer, at the time services are billed.
As of December 31, 1998 this amount was approximately $2,600.
On August 1, 1997, the Company sold its equity investment in Anam
Semiconductor & Technology Co., Ltd. AST, an affiliate of ASI, and certain
investments and notes receivable from companies unrelated to the semiconductor
packaging and test business to AK Investments, Inc., at cost $49,740 and AK
Investments, Inc. assumed $49,740 of the Company long-term borrowings from
Anam USA, Inc. Management estimates that the fair value of these investments and
notes receivable approximated the carrying value at August 1, 1997. Subsequent
to the sale on August 1, 1997 the Company loaned AK Investments, Inc. $12,800
for the purchase of additional investments. The amount outstanding on this loan
at December 31, 1997 and 1998 was $4,350 and $59, respectively.
The Company utilizes AST as a key supplier of leadframes. Historically, the
Company has paid AST for these services on net 30-day terms. Effective at the
end of July 1998, the Company changed its payment policy from net 30-days, to
paid-in advance. Accordingly the Company now pays for its materials before
shipment. This change in payment policy resulted in an advance to AST which is
reflected in the current portion of Due from Affiliate. As of December 31, 1998,
the balance paid in advance to AST was approximately $3,500. Payments to AST
were approximately $27,300, $26,000 and $32,500 during 1996, 1997 and 1998,
respectively.
Anam Engineering and Construction, an affiliate of ASI, built the packaging
facility for AAAP in the Philippines. Payments to Anam Engineering and
Construction were $22,167, $3,844 and $869 in 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively.
Anam Precision Equipment and Anam Instruments manufacture certain equipment used
by the Philippine operations. Payments to Anam Precision Equipment and Anam
Instruments were $6,652, $4,211 and $10,272 in 1996, 1997 and 1998,
respectively.
During 1996, the Company extended guarantees on behalf of an affiliate to
vendors used by this affiliate. Outstanding guarantees as of December 31, 1996
and 1997 were $25,100 and $24,655 respectively. During the third quarter of
1998, the Company was released from its obligations under these guarantees.
Amounts guaranteed under this agreement fluctuated due to the cyclical nature of
the affiliate retail business. Balances guaranteed at December 31 were
generally the largest.
The Company had executed a surety and guarantee agreement on behalf of an
affiliate. The Company had unconditionally guaranteed the affiliate obligation
under a $17,000 line of credit and a $9,000 term loan note. The Company had also
unconditionally guaranteed another affiliate obligation under a $4,000 term
loan
73

EXCEPT SHARE AND DOLLAR PER SHARE DATA
agreement and a $1,000 line of credit. During the third quarter of 1998, the
Company was released from its obligations under these guarantees.
A principal stockholder of the Company has extended guarantees on behalf of
the Company in the amount of $91,000 at December 31, 1998. Also in 1997, a
company controlled by this stockholder purchased investments in the amount of
$49,740 see Note 6.
The Company leases office space in West Chester, PA from certain
stockholders of the Company. The lease expires in 2006. The Company has the
option to extend the lease for an additional 10 years through 2016. On September
11, 1997, the office previously being leased in Chandler, Arizona was purchased
from certain stockholders of the Company. The total purchase price of the
building $5,710 represented the carrying value to the stockholders. Amounts
paid for these leases in 1997 and 1998 were $1,458 and $1,118, respectively.
At December 31, 1997 and 1998, the Company had net balances due from
affiliates other than ASI and AUSA of $36,501 and $27,510, respectively.
Realization of these balances is dependent upon the ability of the affiliates to
repay the amounts due. In management opinion, these receivables are recorded
at the net realizable value.
15. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined by
the Company using available market information and appropriate methodologies;
however, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to
develop the estimates for fair value. Accordingly, these estimates are not
necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a
current market exchange. Certain of these financial instruments are with major
financial institutions and expose the Company to market and credit risks and may
at times be concentrated with certain counterparties or groups of
counterparties. The creditworthiness of counterparties is continually reviewed,
and full performance is anticipated.
The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for short-term
investments, due from affiliates, other accounts receivable, due to affiliates,
accrued expenses and accrued income taxes approximate fair value due to the
short-term nature of these instruments. The methods and assumptions used to
estimate the fair value of other significant classes of financial instruments is
set forth below:
Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are due on demand or
carry a maturity date of less than three months when purchased. The carrying
amount of these financial instruments is a reasonable estimate of fair value.
Available for sale investments. The fair value of these financial
instruments was estimated based on market quotes, recent offerings of similar
securities, current and projected financial performance of the company and net
asset positions.
Short-term borrowings. Short-term borrowings have variable rates that
reflect currently available terms and conditions for similar borrowings. The
carrying amount of this debt is a reasonable estimate of fair value.
Long-term debt. Long-term debt balances have variable rates that reflect
currently available terms and conditions for similar debt. The carrying amount
of this debt is a reasonable estimate of fair value.
Convertible Subordinated Notes. The fair value of these financial
instruments at December 31, 1998 is estimated to be $199,755 based on available
market quotes.
16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is involved in various claims incidental to the conduct of its
business. Based on consultation with legal counsel, management does not believe
that any claims, either individually or in the
74

aggregate, to which the Company is a party will have a material adverse effect
on the Company financial condition or results of operations.
Net future minimum lease payments under operating leases that have initial
or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year at December 31,
1998, are:
$ 8,461

Total net of minimum sublease income of
$112,404
Rent expense, net of sublease income of $131, $366 and $575 for 1996, 1997
and 1998, respectively, amounted to $5,520, $6,709 and $7,751 for 1996, 1997 and
1998, respectively.
The Company has various purchase commitments for materials, supplies and
capital equipment incidental to the ordinary conduct of business. As of December
31, 1998 the Company had commitments for capital equipment of approximately
$31,000. In the aggregate, such commitments are not at prices in excess of
current market.
17. ACQUISITIONS
On September 30, 1996, AEI and a principal stockholder each acquired 50% of
the outstanding common stock of Amkor Anam Test Services, Inc. AATS, formerly
Navell Test Consultants, Inc., a provider of test engineering services for the
semiconductor industry located in San Jose, California, for approximately
$2,860. Subsequent to September 30, 1996, AEI purchased the 50% interest owned
by a principal stockholder at the stockholder original cost. The acquisition
was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the results of
AATS' operations are included in the Company consolidated statements of income
effective October 1, 1996. Accordingly, the total purchase price was allocated
to the assets and liabilities based upon their estimated respective fair values.
This acquisition resulted in goodwill of approximately $2,356, which is being
amortized over 20 years.
On June 1, 1998, the Company purchased ASI 40% interest in AAP for
$33,750. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting which resulted in the elimination of the minority interest liability
reflected on the consolidated balance sheet and the recording of approximately
$23,910 of goodwill which is being amortized over 10 years.
18. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, during the fourth quarter of 1998.
The Company has identified two reportable segments packaging and test
services and wafer fabrication services that are managed separately because the
services provided by each segment require different technology and marketing
strategies.
Packaging and test services: Through its three factories located in the
Philippines as well as the four ASI factories in Korea, under contract, the
Company offers a complete and integrated set of packaging and test
75

services including IC packaging design, leadframe and substrate design, IC
package assembly, final testing, burn-in, reliability testing and thermal and
electrical characterization.
Wafer fabrication services: Through its wafer fabrication services
division, the Company provides marketing, engineering, and support services for
ASI deep submicron CMOS foundry, under a long-term supply agreement.
During the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, sales to Intel
Corporation accounted for approximately $275,000, $340,000 and $324,000,
respectively, of packaging and test revenues.
The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as those
described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company
evaluates its operating segments based on operating income.
Summarized financial information concerning the Company reportable
segments is shown in the following table. The Other column includes the
elimination of inter-segment balances and corporate assets which include cash
and cash equivalents, non-operating balances due from affiliates, investment in
TSTC see Note 6 and other investments.

20. THE ACQUISITION OF K4 AND INVESTMENT IN ASI
The Company has entered into an asset purchase agreement with ASI to
purchase the assets of ASI packaging and test facility located in Kwangju,
Korea K4, excluding cash and cash equivalents, notes and accounts
receivables, intercompany accounts and existing claims against third parties.
This purchase price would be reduced to $582,000 if the Company signs an
agreement to make an equity investment of $150,000. The purchase price for K4 is
$607,000, including the assumption of up to $7,000 of employee benefit
liabilities in ASI over a four year period, pursuant to the proposed financial
restructuring of ASI with its creditor banks, called Workout. The Company has
sent ASI creditor banks a letter committing to make an equity investment in
ASI see Note 14. K4 provides packaging and test services for advanced
leadframe and laminate packages that are used in high-performance electronic
products such as cellular telephones, laptop computers, digital cameras and
microprocessors. K4 began operating in October 1996 and is ASI newest
semiconductor packaging and test facility. In addition to other conditions,
including the satisfactory
77
80
AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS,
EXCEPT SHARE AND DOLLAR PER SHARE DATA
completion of due diligence, the receipt of a fairness opinion and final board
approval, the Company acquisition of K4 is subject to its ability to obtain
financing of the entire amount of the purchase price on reasonable terms. We
cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain this financing on reasonable
terms. The Company intends to finance the full purchase price of K4.
K4 is situated on approximately 100 acres and currently consists of a
1,000,000 square foot facility, including 782,000 square feet of manufacturing
and administrative space. K4 provides packaging and test services for many of
our most advanced packages. In addition, the K4 site has the infrastructure in
place to accommodate four pre-configured modules for a total of 1,600,000 square
feet of incremental capacity.
In connection with the acquisition of K4, the Company will enter into a
Transition Services Agreement with ASI. Pursuant to this agreement, ASI will
continue to provide many of the same non-manufacturing related services to K4
that it provided prior to the Acquisition, including transportation and
shipping, human resources and accounting and general administrative services.
The Company will also enter into an Intellectual Property License Agreement
with ASI that will become effective upon the closing of the acquisition.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Anam Industrial Co., Ltd.
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Anam Industrial Co.,
Ltd. and its subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, capital surplus and retained
earnings accumulated deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1997 which financial statements are prepared
under generally accepted accounting principles in the Republic of Korea and are
not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit
the financial statements of Anam USA, Inc. Anam USA, a wholly-owned
subsidiary, and Anam Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd. Anam
Construction, a 596% owned subsidiary, which statements reflect total assets
of W913,721 million and W660,729 million as of December 31, 1997 and 1996,
respectively, and total net income loss of W10,011 million in 1997, W5,738
million in 1996 and W2,925 million in 1995. Additionally, we did not audit the
financial statements of Amkor/Anam Pilipinas, Inc. AAPI, a 40% owned
affiliate, the investment in which is reflected in the financial statements
using the equity method of accounting. The Company investment in AAPI was
W38,612 million and W19,077 million as of December 31, 1997 and 1996,
respectively, and the equity in its net income loss was W44,491 million in
1997, W2,050 million in 1996 and W1,570 million in 1995. The aforementioned
financial statements were audited by other auditors whose reports have been
furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included
for Anam USA, Anam Construction and AAPI, is based solely on the reports of the
other auditors. The auditors of Anam Construction and AAPI expressed
uncertainties in their audit reports about the respective companies' ability to
continue as a going concern.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards in the Republic of Korea, which are substantially the same as those
followed in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the reports of
other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audits and the reports of other auditors, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Anam Industrial Co., Ltd. and its
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
in the Republic of Korea.
As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, in accordance with
revised Financial Accounting Standards in the Republic of Korea effective in
1997 and 1996, respectively, the Company changed it methods of accounting for
unrealized foreign currency translation gains or losses on long-term assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. In 1997, such gains or losses are
deferred and amortized over the lives or maturities of corresponding assets and
liabilities using the straight-line method. In 1996, such gains or losses had
been recorded, as a capital adjustment to shareholders' equity. Prior to 1996,
such gains or losses had been recognized currently.
The financial statements referred to above have been prepared assuming that
the Company, will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the
financial statements, the operations of the Company have been significantly
affected, and will continue to be affected for the foreseeable future, by
Korea unstable economy caused by currency volatility and unstable finance
markets in Korea. The Company has traditionally operated with a significant
amount of debt relative to its equity, has a significant working capital deficit
at December 31, 1997 and has contractually guaranteed the debt obligations of
certain affiliates and subsidiaries.

These significant uncertainties may affect the Company future operations and
its ability to maintain or refinance certain debt obligations as they mature,
which raise substantial doubt regarding the Company ability to continue as a
going concern. Management plans to address these matters, which are also
disclosed in Note 3, include entering into the Korean financial restructuring
program known as Workout in October 1998. The Workout program is the results
of an accord among Korea financial institutions to assist in the restructuring
of Korean business enterprises and does not involve the judicial system. The
ultimate outcome of these uncertainties cannot be determined presently and the
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from these
uncertainties.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Anam Engineering & Construction Co., Ltd.
We have audited the balance sheets of Anam Engineering & Construction Co.,
Ltd. the Company as of December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, and the related
statements of operations and accumulated deficit and cash flows for the years
then ended which financial statements are prepared under generally accepted
accounting principles in the Republic of Korea and are not included in this
prospectus or elsewhere in this Registration Statement. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards in the Republic of Korea, which are substantially the same as those
followed in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Anam Engineering &
Construction Co., Ltd. as of December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, and the results
of its operations and the changes in its accumulated deficit and its cash flows
for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the Republic of Korea.
The financial statements referred to above have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 20 to the
financial statements, the operations of the Company have been significantly
affected, and will continue to be affected for the foreseeable future, by
Korea unstable economy caused by currency volatility and unstable finance
markets in Korea. The Company has traditionally operated with a significant
amount of debt relative to its equity. Because of Korea unstable economy and
the Company dependence on debt financing, there are significant uncertainties
that may affect the Company future operations and its abilities to maintain or
regarding the Company ability to continue as a going concern. The Company
applied to the District Court of Seoul in Korea for permission to enter into the
Korean debts rescheduling plan known as court receivership in October 24,
1998. And the Company was bankrupted in October 29, 1998. It is presently
uncertain whether the application shall be approved by the court. The ultimate
outcome of these uncertainties cannot be determined presently and the financial
statements do not include adjustments that might result from these
uncertainties.
As discussed in Note 17 to the financial statements, the Company executed a
merger in which the operations of Hanyong Corporation were combined with the
Company as of July 31, 1997. This merger was accounted for as a transfer of
assets and liabilities under common control at historical costs in a manner
similar to a pooling of interest of U.S. GAAP reporting purposes.
As discussed in Note 14 to financial statements, the Company sales its
product to Anam Semiconductor Inc. Anam Industrial Co., Ltd. and other
affiliated companies. The amounts of sales are W244,013 million, W313,894
million and W47,109 million during the year ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and
1995, and balance of account receivable are W31,844 million, W53,816 million and
W79,316 million at December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 respectively and balances of
account payable are W4,834 million, W122 million and W403 million at December 31
of 1997, 1996 and 1995 respectively.
The amounts expressed in U.S. Dollars, presented solely for the convenience
of the reader, have been translated on the basis set forth in Note 3 to
financial statements.

Reference is made to the information regarding our directors and officers

incorporated by reference.
COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16a OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
Section 16a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company
officers and Directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a
registered class of the Company equity securities, to file reports of
ownership on Form 3 and changes in ownership on Form 4 or 5 with the Securities
and Exchange Commission the SEC and the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. Such officers, Directors and ten-percent stockholders are also
required by SEC rules to furnish the Company with copies of all forms that they
file pursuant to Section 16a. Based solely on its review of the copies of such
forms received by it, or written representations from certain reporting persons
that no other reports were required for such persons, the Company believes that
all Section 16a filing requirements applicable to its officers, Directors and
ten-percent stockholders were complied with in a timely fashion.
