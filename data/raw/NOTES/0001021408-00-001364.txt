Notes To Condensed Financial Statements 1.    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Viisage is a leader in the emerging field of biometrics technology and in
providing digital identification systems and solutions. The Company focuses on
identification solutions that improve personal convenience and security, deter
fraud, and reduce identification program costs. Viisage combines its systems
integration and software design capabilities with its proprietary software and
hardware products and other industry standard products to create complete
customized solutions. These turnkey solutions integrate image and data capture,
create relational databases, incorporate multiple biometrics and improve
customers' ability to move and manage information. Applications can include
driver licenses, voter registration, national ID, law enforcement, social
services, access control and PC network and internet access security. To date,
Viisage primary customers have been government agencies with particular
emphasis on U.S. drivers licensing agencies.
The Company is engaged in one business, the development and implementation of
digital identification systems and solutions. Effective June 1, 1998, the
Company reorganized its operations to create a separate biometrics division to
respond to the growing market interest in biometric solutions. The biometrics
division is focused on product, market, and channel development activities in
three principal areas: facility access control, PC network and internet access
security, and real-time large database identification and verification of
individuals. The systems integration and identification card division SI
division focuses on Viisage public sector markets and serves as a channel to
existing customers and the public sector for the Company biometric
technologies. Since June 1, 1998, the Company has operated in two segments.
Amounts for the biometrics division prior to the reorganization are not
material.
As of December 31, 1999, the Company was a 64% owned subsidiary of Lau
Technologies Lau. 2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
32 Computation of Net Loss per Share
Basic and dilutive net loss per share is computed based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. The diluted per share
amounts do not reflect the impact of options outstanding for approximately
2,472,139 shares in 1999, 2,784,531 shares in 1998, and 1,770,550 shares in
1997, the conversion of convertible subordinated debt, the conversion of
convertible preferred stock, or stock warrants because their effect is
antidilutive. Except for the convertible subordinated debt, convertible
preferred stock, warrants and options referred to above, the Company does not
have any other potential common stock at December 31, 1999. Contract Revenue and Cost Recognition
The Company provides services principally under contracts that provide for a
fixed price for each system and/or for each card produced. Revenue is recognized
using the percentage of completion method based on labor costs incurred and/or
cards produced. Contract losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which
they become determinable. Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings are
recorded as a current asset. Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings
and accrued contract costs are recorded as current liabilities. Generally,
contracts provide for billing when contract milestones are met and/or cards are
produced. Retainages and amounts subject to future negotiation are not material.
Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings include approximately $7
million expected to be billed and collected after December 31, 2000. Charges and Accounting Change
During the first quarter of 1998, the Company recorded charges of approximately
$230,000 related to a restructuring to reduce expenses in line with the
Company revised plan for 1998. Approximately $50,000 of such charges are
included in project costs, $170,000 are included in sales and marketing expenses
and $10,000 are included in general and administrative expenses in the statement
of operations. During the third and fourth quarters of 1998, the Company
recorded charges of $472,000 and $1,850,000, respectively, to revise project
margins and contract cost-to-complete estimates. Approximately $2,222,000 of
such charges are included in project costs and $100,000 are included in general
and administrative expenses in the statement of operations.
During 1998, the Company elected early adoption of Statement of Position No.
98-5 SOP 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities, which requires
start-up costs to be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized. The Company
previously capitalized certain start-up costs as pre-contract costs under SOP
81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain
Production-Type Contracts, and charged such costs to contracts upon award. As
required, the adoption of SOP 98-5 has been made effective as of the beginning
of 1998. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of
$1,038,000 was recorded as a one-time charge in the Company results for 1998.
33 During the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company recorded non-recurring charges of
approximately $76 million related to investments in technology, services and
markets. These investments relate principally to upgrades and enhancements to
older systems, enhancements to central production and data management
capabilities and enhancements to certain systems to facilitate the future use of
facial recognition technologies. Approximately $53 million of such charges are
included in project costs and $23 million are included in sales and marketing
expenses in the statement of operations. Cash and Cash Equivalents
The company considers all highly liquid instruments, with a maturity of three
months or less when acquired, to be cash equivalents. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Company financial instruments, including cash and
cash equivalents, accounts receivable and payable and short- and long-term
borrowings, approximate fair values. Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are due principally from government agencies and contractors
to government agencies. Management periodically reviews accounts receivable for
possible uncollectible amounts. In the event management determines a specific
need for an allowance, a provision for doubtful accounts is provided. Based on
management review, a $100,000 allowance for doubtful accounts has been
established at December 31, 1999 and 1998.
For 1999, 1998 and 1997, four customers, three customers, and one customer,
respectively, each accounted for more than 10% of revenues individually, and
approximately 52%, 40% and 46% in the aggregate of the Company revenues,
respectively. At December 31, 1999, 75% of accounts receivable are due from five
customers. Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost or the lesser of fair value or the
present value of minimum lease payments for items acquired under capital leases.
Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line or
usage-based methods over the estimated useful lives of the related assets or the
lease term, whichever is shorter. Research and Development
Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.
34 Software Development
The Company reviews software development costs incurred in accordance with the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 86,
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
Marketed, which requires that certain costs incurred in the development of
computer software to be sold or leased be capitalized once technological
feasibility is reached. The Company has not capitalized any software development
costs because development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of
technological feasibility have not been material.
Costs related to software developed for internal use are expensed as incurred,
except for externally purchased software, which is capitalized and depreciated
over its estimated useful life not to exceed five years. Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured
using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization
of the Company net deferred tax asset, the Company has provided a full
valuation allowance against this amount. Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans under Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, establishes a fair value based
method of accounting for stock-based compensation plans. The Company has adopted
the disclosure only alternative under SFAS No. 123, which requires disclosure of
the pro forma effects on earnings and earnings per share as if SFAS No. 123 had
been adopted as well as certain other information. See note 10 for required
disclosures. Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133 SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which requires companies to recognize all
derivative contracts at their fair values as either assets or liabilities on the
balance sheet.
Historically, the Company has not entered into derivative contracts either to
hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes. Accordingly, the Company does
not expect the adoption of the new standard to affect its financial statements.
35 3.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Debt
During the first quarter of 1999, the Company issued Lau options to purchase
60,000 shares of the Company common stock in exchange for Lau guarantee of
an indemnification obligation of the Company. The options are exercisable
through February 2002 at $190 per share. The fair value of the options,
amounting to $36,000, have been credited to shareholders' equity and included in
deferred financing cost, a component of other assets. The value of these options
will be amortized over the indemnification period and charged to interest
expense.
In May 1999, the Company received a commitment from Lau to lend to the Company
up to $2,000,000 in exchange for a 4% convertible subordinated note. Amounts
drawn under the note, with Lau consent, and related accrued interest are
convertible at Lau option into shares of the Company common stock at any
time prior to January 1, 2001 at $126 per share. In May 1999, the Company
borrowed $1,000,000 under this commitment, which is outstanding as of December
31, 1999.
The Company has a project lease financing arrangement with Lau that provides for
up to $31 million of capital lease financing in 1999 with $31 million
outstanding at December 31, 1999
On October 14, 1999, Lau Technologies exercised an option to convert $800,000,
4%, subordinated convertible debt, borrowed prior to 1999, plus accrued interest
of $33,000, into 526,582 shares of the Company common stock at the conversion
price of $158 per share. Licenses
The Company has two non exclusive license agreements with Lau, whereby Lau acts
as a distributor of the Company Facial Recognition Technology for certain
European Markets, U.S. Airports and other end users that are Federal Agencies.
Lau will pay the Company royalties, as defined, under these agreements. Through
December 31, 1999, no royalties have been earned.
The Company has also obtained from Lau an exclusive except for limited fields
reserved by Lau, perpetual, worldwide license to use the U.S. patent 5,432,864
purchased by Lau from Daozeng Lu and Simon Lu, and all improvements thereto,
which relates to a system for automatically verifying the identity of an
individual using identification parameters that are carried on an escort memory
such as an identification or credit card. This license requires royalty payments
to Lau for each unit sold or licensed by Viisage. The agreement also requires
the issuance of 50,000 shares of Viisage common stock to Lau following the
royalty commencement date.
36 Other
Under an Administration and Services Agreement, Lau provides general accounting,
data processing, payroll, certain human resources, employee benefits
administration and certain executive services to the Company. The agreement
requires the Company to pay a monthly fee based on the estimated actual cost of
such services and permits the Company to terminate selected services upon 30
days written notice. The annual fee for services is revised if the level of
services is changed. Amounts for 1999 and 1998 reflect a continued reduction in
services. The amounts for such services were approximately $418,000 in 1999 636,000 in 1998 and $864,000 in 1997.
A Use and Occupancy Agreement requires the Company to pay its proportionate
share of the cost of shared facilities and office services including rent,
insurance, property taxes, utilities and other operating expenses, based on
square footage or equipment utilized. The annual fee for facilities and services
is revised for changes in space utilized and in operating expenses. The amounts
for facilities and services were approximately $217,000 in 1999, $550,000 in
1998 and $512,000 in 1997, respectively. See note 7 for lease information.
Company employees participate in various Lau employee benefit plans. The Company
pays its proportionate share of the costs of such plans based on the number of
participating employees.
Management believes the methods for allocating expenses and those costs related
to shared facilities and equipment are reasonable and approximate what these
costs would be on a stand-alone basis.
The Company purchases certain system components and technical personnel services
from Lau. The amounts for such components and services were approximately $05
million in 1999, $10 million in 1998 and $19 million in 1997. During 1999 and
1998, the Company provided software development services as a subcontractor to
Lau amounting to $120,000 and $500,000, respectively.
At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company had approximately $35,000 and
$596,000 of accounts receivable due from Lau, respectively, and approximately
$119,000 and $906,000 of accounts payable due to Lau, respectively. The Company
also has a 9% note receivable from Lau Technologies due in monthly installments
of principal and interest of approximately $21,000 through February 28, 2002. At
December 31, 1999 and 1998, approximately $214,000 and $197,000 of the note was
included in other current assets, respectively, and the remaining balance of
approximately $258,000 and $472,000 was included in other assets, respectively,
in the accompanying balance sheet.
The Company has employment and noncompetition agreements with certain officers.
Such agreements provide for employment and related compensation, and restrict
the individuals from competing, as defined, with the Company during the terms of
their respective agreements and for up to two years thereafter. The agreements
also provide for stock options under the Company stock option plan and for
severance payments upon termination under circumstances defined in such
agreements.

During 1999 and 1998, the Company sold and leased back under capital leases
approximately $31 million and $52 million, respectively, of system equipment
used to produce identification cards for certain contracts.
In October 1997, Viisage completed a System Sale, License and Subcontract
Agreement the Agreement with Unisys Corporation Unisys. Under the Agreement,
Viisage purchased and licensed certain assets from Unisys and agreed to perform
certain services as Unisys' subcontractor relating to a digital imaging system
for the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. The purchase
price was $4 million, consisting of $38 million paid in 1997 and two payments
of $100,000 each, one made in December 1998 and the other to be made on October
1, 2000. In addition, Viisage agreed to additional contingent payments of up to
$754,000 depending largely on Unisys' support of Viisage efforts to generate
incremental revenues from Florida state agencies. The purchase, including
approximately $100,000 of transaction costs, was recorded using the purchase
method of accounting and has been allocated to system assets which are being
amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the system. 5.    ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES

38 6.   LONG TERM DEBT AND PROJECT LEASE ARRANGEMENTS
In December 1998, the Company executed an amended and restated agreement with a
commercial bank to provide a new revolving credit facility to the Company
through June 2000. Outstanding term and revolving credit borrowings were repaid
with funds from the new agreement at closing. In connection with the bank
commitment, the revolving credit facility was amended to provide for borrowings
of up to $9 million through December 31, 1999 and $65 million through June 30,
2000 at the prime rate plus 1%. The facility is secured by substantially all of
the Company assets and requires the Company to maintain certain financial
ratios and minimum levels of earnings and tangible capital funds, as defined. At
December 31, 1999, the Company was in compliance with all loan covenants. The
revolving credit facility also requires the Company to raise funds, as needed,
from other sources to cover biometrics division expenses. These sources are
expected to include a combination of biometrics division revenues, subordinated
debt and equity capital.
In March 2000, the Company received a two-year commitment letter from a
commercial bank to provide a new revolving credit facility to the Company
through April 2002. In connection with the bank commitment, the revolving
credit facility is amended to provide for borrowings of up to $4 million at the
prime rate plus 1 1/4%. The facility is secured by substantially all of the
Company assets and requires the Company to maintain certain financial ratios
and minimum levels of earnings and tangible capital funds, as defined. The
accompanying financial statements reflect this commitment as of December 31,
1999.
The Company also has a system project lease financing arrangement with a
commercial leasing organization. Pursuant to this arrangement, the lessor
purchases certain of the Company digital identification systems and leases
them back to Viisage for deployment with identified and contracted customers
approved by the lessor. The lessor retains title to systems and has an
assignment of Viisage rights under the related customer contracts, including
rights to use the software and technology underlying the related systems. Under
this arrangement, the lessor bears the credit risk associated with payments by
Viisage customers, but Viisage bears performance and appropriation risk and is
generally required to repurchase a system in the event of a termination by a
customer for any reason except credit default. The Company is also required to
maintain certain financial ratios and minimum levels of tangible capital funds,
as defined. At December 31, 1999, the Company was in compliance with all lease
covenants. These project lease arrangements are accounted for as capital leases.
The current arrangement provides for project financing of up to $150 million.
At December 31, 1999, the Company had approximately $116 million outstanding
under the lease financing arrangement. The Company has a similar project lease
financing arrangement with Lau that provides for up to $31 million of capital
lease financing in 1999 with $31 million outstanding at December 31, 1999.
The Company believes that it will continue to meet its debt covenants. However,
this expectation is dependent in part on achieving business forecasts and
raising funds to cover biometrics division expenses. If the Company does not
meet such covenants, the bank and the lessor could require immediate repayment
of amounts outstanding.
39 7.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Leases
The Company leases certain equipment and facilities used in its operations and
the shared facilities discussed in note 3. Rental expense for operating leases

At December 31, 1999, the Company had available estimated net operating loss
carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately $116 million to reduce,
subject to certain limitations, future income taxes. These carryforwards expire
from 2011 to 2019 and are subject to review and possible adjustment by the
Internal Revenue Service. 10.   SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
Stock Option Plans
Under the 1996 Management Stock Option Plan and the 1996 Director Stock Option
Plan the Plans, the Board of Directors may grant incentive and nonqualified
stock options to employees and officers and nonqualified stock options to
directors. Generally, incentive stock options are granted at fair value and are
subject to the requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended. Nonqualified options are granted at exercise prices determined by
the Board of Directors. Options granted to date to directors vest over three
years from the date of grant. Options granted to management and employees vest

41 years or, in some cases, earlier if certain performance measures are met. The
performance measures are based on each $1 million increase in Company value up
to approximately $500 million, as adjusted. All options granted under the Plans
expire ten years from the date of grant.
At December 31, 1999, the Company has reserved 2,057,100 shares of common stock
for issuance under the management plan of which 454,945 shares are available for
future grants, and 201,616 shares of common stock under the director plan which

177,000 employee options and from $625 to $225 on 21,000 options granted to
certain management personnel. These options were treated as cancelled and
reissued in the table that follows.

approximately $02 million for 1999, $11 million for 1998, and $37 million for
1997, respectively. Of these amounts, approximately $07 million, $08 million,
and $04 million would have been charged to operations for the years ended
December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, for currently vested options.
The remaining amounts of $58 million, $64 million and $61 million for the
years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, should be amortized
over the related vesting periods. The pro forma effect of SFAS No. 123 is as

on the number of shares the holder can convert at any one time, the holder can
convert up to 50% of the preferred stock into shares of the Company common
stock beginning six months after closing and the balance beginning nine months
after closing. Shares can be converted at the lesser of $300 per share or 85%

of 1933, as amended. In connection with this transaction, the Company paid an
investment banking fee of $112,500 and warrants to purchase 75,000 shares of the
Company common stock, exercisable for three years, at an exercise price of
$179 per share which was 130% of the then current closing price of the
Company common stock. The Company also issued warrants to purchase 75,000

42 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In connection with this
transaction, the Company paid an investment banking fee of $60,000 and warrants
to purchase 20,000 shares of the Company common stock, exercisable for three
years, at an exercise price of $894 per share which was 130% of the then

warrants to purchase 50,000 shares of the Company common stock, exercisable
for three years, at an exercise price of $894 per share to the investor.
In the event of liquidation of the company, the preferred shareholders would

accrued and unpaid dividends.
On December 9, 1999, warrants issued through the placement of the series A
preferred stock were exercised at $179 for the purchase of 75,000 shares of
common stock.

shares of common stock, closing warrants to purchase 97,979 shares of the
Company common stock, exercisable for five years at $1177 per share, and
adjustable warrants, exercisable at nominal consideration during three 25
trading day periods beginning four months following closing which may be
delayed to December 31, 2000. The adjustable warrants terminate if the market
value of the Company common stock exceeds $1428 for any 20 consecutive trading
days prior to the adjustment periods. If not terminated, the number of shares
that may be acquired under the adjustable warrants is determined by a formula
that is dependent on the extent to which the market value of the Company
common stock is less than $1109 per share during the adjustment periods.
Subject to certain closing conditions, two additional investments of $3,000,000
each may be invested by the same investor between 150 and 170 days after the
initial investment and between 120 and 140 days thereafter on similar terms. The
purchase price of the common stock for each additional investment will equal
115% of the average per share market value for the ten trading days prior to the
applicable closing date and the closing warrants will equal to 25% of each
investment at an exercise price equal to 125% of the average per share market
price for the five trading days prior to such closing date. The termination
amount for the subsequent adjustable warrants will be 140% of the market value
of the common stock on the applicable closing date and the formula amount will
be set at 108% of such market value. 11.   BUSINESS SEGMENTS, GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION, AND CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK
The Company is engaged in one business, the development and implementation of
digital identification systems and solutions. Effective June 1, 1998, the
Company reorganized its operations to create two separate divisions, a
biometrics division and a systems integration and identification card division
SI. Since June 1, 1998, the Company has operated in two segments. Amounts for
the biometrics division prior to the reorganization are not material. The costs
of shared facilities and certain administrative services have been allocated to
each division based on actual usage or other methods that approximate actual
usage. All other costs and expenses have been allocated to each business based
on actual usage. The Company accounting policies for its segments are the same
as disclosed in Note 2. Management evaluates segment performance based on
operating income.
45 Substantially all of the Company revenues are currently derived from the SI
division public sector customers and contractors to such customers. The
Company believes that for the foreseeable future it will continue to derive a
significant portion of its revenues from a limited number of large contracts.
For the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, four customers, three
customers and one customer, respectively, each accounted for more than 10% of
the Company revenues and an aggregate of 52%, 40% and 46% of revenues for each
of the years, respectively.                     1999   1998    1997
