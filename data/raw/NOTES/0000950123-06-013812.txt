See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 37 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies Rockwell Automation, Inc. the Company or Rockwell Automation is a leading global provider of
industrial automation power, control and information products and services. Basis of Presentation Except as indicated, amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements or the notes
thereto relate to our continuing operations. In September2004, we sold our FirstPoint Contact business. FirstPoint Contact is classified
as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. In June2006, we announced our intention to divest our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric
motors and motor repair services businesses. These businesses are reflected in continuing
operations for all periods presented as the criteria for discontinued operations prescribed by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFASNo144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, had not been met as of September30, 2006, the date in which this
standard requires the criteria to be assessed. On
November7, 2006, we announced that we have entered into a
definitive agreement to sell these businesses to Baldor Electric
Company Baldor for $18billion, comprised of $175billion in
cash and $50million in Baldor common stock. The
transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory
approval and is expected to close in the second quarter of our fiscal
2007. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned and controlled majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliates over which we have
the ability to exert significant influence, but that we do not control and are not the primary
beneficiary of, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, our
proportional share of the respective affiliates earnings or losses is included in other income
expensein the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Investments in affiliates over which we do
not have the ability to exert significant influence are accounted for using the cost method of
accounting. These affiliated companies are not material individually or in the aggregate to our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Use of Estimates The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. We use estimates in accounting for, among other items,
customer returns, rebates and incentives; allowance for doubtful accounts; excess and obsolete
inventory; impairment of long-lived assets; product warranty obligations; retirement benefits;
litigation, claims and contingencies, including environmental matters and conditional asset
retirement obligations; and income taxes. We account for changes to estimates and assumptions
prospectively when warranted by factually based experience. Revenue Recognition We record sales of products and services, representing approximately 90percent of our
consolidated sales, when all of the following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists; pricing
is fixed or determinable; collection is reasonably assured; and product has been delivered and
acceptance has occurred, as may be required according to contract terms, or services have been
rendered. We recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as construction-type contracts
using either the percentage-of-completion or completed contract method of accounting. We record
sales relating to these contracts using the percentage-of-completion method when we determine that
progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable; we use the completed contract
method for all others. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize sales and gross
profit as work is performed using either ithe relationship between actual costs incurred and
total estimated costs at completion or iiunits-of-delivery. Under the percentage-of-completion
method, we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue
in the period the change is identified. We record estimated losses on contracts when they are
identified. 38 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies Continued We use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of
sale. We use shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery. We
assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the
transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess
collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations
and analysis, as well as the customers payment history. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales and the related costs
are included in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Returns, Rebates and Incentives Our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based
on agreed amounts that vary depending on the end user or original equipment manufacturer OEM
customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product. We also offer various other
incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates, account
credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria. Certain
distributors are offered a right to return product, subject to contractual limitations. We record accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at the time of revenue
recognition based primarily on historical experience. Returns, rebates and incentives are
recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits. Rebates and
incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided.
Amounts are accrued at the time of recognition of our sale to a distributor or direct sale
customer. Accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or, where a right of
set-off exists, as a reduction of accounts receivable. Taxes on Revenue Producing Transactions Taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue producing transactions, including sales,
value added, excise and use taxes, are recorded on a net basis excluded from revenue. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include time deposits and certificates of deposit with original
maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Receivables We record allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general
matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions. Receivables are
stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $152million at September30, 2006 and $184
million at September30, 2005. In addition, receivables are stated net of an allowance for certain
customer returns, rebates and incentives of $85million at September30, 2006 and $94million at
September30, 2005. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out FIFOor
average cost methods. Market is determined on the basis of estimated realizable values. Property Property is stated at cost. We calculate depreciation of property using the straight-line
method over 15 to 40years for buildings and improvements, 3 to 14years for machinery and
equipment and 3 to 10years for computer hardware and software. We capitalize significant renewals
and enhancements and write off replaced units. We expense maintenance and repairs, as well as
renewals of minor amounts. Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets generally result from business acquisitions. We account
for business acquisitions by allocating the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets
acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values, the excess of the purchase price over the
allocated amount is recorded as goodwill. 39 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies Continued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to be reviewed
for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate an impairment may be
present, rather than amortized as previous standards required. Any excess in carrying value over
the estimated fair value is charged to results of operations. We perform an annual impairment test
during the second quarter of our fiscal year. We amortize intangible assets with finite useful lives on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 40years for distributor networks, 3 to 10
years for computer software products, 6 to 14years for patents and 3 to 14years for other
intangible assets. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate the recoverability of the recorded amount of long-lived assets whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully
recoverable. An impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived
from an asset are less than its carrying amount. If we determine that an asset is impaired, we
measure the impairment to be recognized as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset
exceeds its fair value. We report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the recorded amount or
fair value less cost to sell. We determine fair value using a discounted future cash flow
analysis. Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange
contracts and interest rate swap contracts to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks. We
use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset changes in the amount of future cash
flows associated with intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next three years cash
flow hedges and changes in the fair value of certain assets and liabilities resulting from
intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies. We
sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt.
Our accounting method for derivative financial instruments is based upon the designation of such
instruments as hedges under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. It is
our policy to execute such instruments with creditworthy banks and not to enter into derivative
financial instruments for speculative purposes. All foreign currency forward exchange contracts
are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. Foreign Currency Translation We translate assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States
with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars using exchange rates at the
end of the respective period. We translate sales, costs and expenses at average exchange rates
effective during the respective period. We report foreign currency translation adjustments as a
component of other comprehensive income. Currency transaction gains and losses are included in the
results of operations in the period incurred. Research and Development Expenses We expense research and development RD costs as incurred; these costs were $1604million
in 2006, $1386million in 2005 and $1217million in 2004. We include RD expenses in cost of
sales in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Income Taxes We record a liability for income tax exposures when they are probable and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. Tax benefits related to claims are also recognized when they become probable
and reasonably estimable. When determining the probability and the estimability of the liability
or tax benefit, we consider the relevant tax law as applied to us by the particular country, state,
or other taxing authority. 40 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies Continued Earnings Per Share We present basic and diluted earnings per share EPSamounts. Basic EPS is calculated by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS amounts are based upon the weighted average number of common and common equivalent
shares outstanding during the year. We use the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of
outstanding share-based compensation awards. Share-based compensation awards for which the total
employee proceeds exceed the average market price over the period have an antidilutive effect on
EPS, and accordingly, we exclude them from the calculation. Antidilutive share-based compensation
awards for the years ended September30, 2006 905,455 shares, 2005 20,013 shares and 2004
51,938 shares were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation. The following table reconciles basic weighted average outstanding shares to diluted weighted

Share-Based Compensation Effective October1, 2005, we adopted SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R, using
the modified prospective application transition method. We recognize share-based compensation
expense on grants of share-based compensation awards on a straight-line basis over the service
period of each award recipient. See Note 11 for additional information. SFAS 123R requires us
to report the tax benefit from the tax deduction related to share-based compensation that is in
excess of recognized compensation costs excess tax benefits as a financing cash flow rather than
as an operating cash flow. Prior to 2006 and the adoption of SFAS 123R, we reported the entire
tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options as an operating cash flow. Product and Workers Compensation Liabilities We record accruals for product and workers compensation claims in the period in which they
are probable and reasonably estimable. Our principal self-insurance programs include product
liability and workers compensation where we self-insure up to a specified dollar amount. Claims
exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies purchased from commercial
insurers. We estimate the liability for the majority of the self-insured claims using our claims
experience for the periods being valued. Environmental Matters We record accruals for environmental matters in the period in which our responsibility is
probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. We make changes to the accruals in the periods
in which the estimated costs of remediation change. At environmental sites for which more than one
potentially responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for our estimated
allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable
share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. At environmental
sites for which we are the only responsible party, we record a liability for the total estimated
costs of remediation. We do not discount to their present value future expenditures for
environmental remediation obligations. If we determine that recovery from insurers or other third
parties is probable, we record a receivable for the estimated recovery. 41 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies Continued Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations We account for conditional asset retirement obligations under Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASBInterpretation No47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations FIN
47. We accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible
long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal
operation of the long-lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not
conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional. See Note 17 for additional
information related to these obligations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statements No87, 88, 106, and 132R
SFAS 158. SFAS 158 requires companies to recognize the funded status of pension and other
postretirement benefit plans on sponsoring employers balance sheets and to recognize changes in
the funded status in the year the changes occur. It also requires the measurement date of plan
assets and obligations to occur at the end of the employers fiscal year. SFAS 158 is effective
for us at the end of fiscal 2007, except for the change in measurement date, which is effective for
us in fiscal 2008. The effect on our financial statements is dependent upon the discount rate at
our fiscal 2007 measurement date June30, 2007 and actual returns on our pension plan assets
during the year. We expect the statement to result in a reduction of our shareowners equity. It
is unlikely that FAS 158 will affect our loan covenant compliance or our other financial
arrangements. In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157. SFAS 157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. It also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes information
used in developing assumptions when pricing an asset or liability. SFAS 157 will be effective for
us beginning in fiscal 2008. We are evaluating the statement to determine the effect on our
financial statements and related disclosures. In September2006, the Securities Exchange Commission SECissued Staff Accounting Bulletin
No108, Financial Statements Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements SAB 108. SAB 108 requires companies to
quantify the impact of all correcting misstatements, including both the carryover and reversing
effects of prior year misstatements, on the current year financial statements. This pronouncement
is effective for us in fiscal 2007. We do not believe SAB 108 will have a material effect on our
financial statements and related disclosures. In June2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and retirement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN
48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 will be effective for us beginning in fiscal
2008. We are evaluating the interpretation to determine the effect on our financial statements and
related disclosures. 42 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   2.
Acquisitions and Divestitures 2006 Acquisitions and Divestitures In May2006, our Control Systems segment acquired GEPA mbH, a provider of change management
software for industrial automation, process control and industrial information technology. In
January2006, our Control Systems segment acquired Caribbean Integration Engineers, Inc. CIE. CIE
offers engineering services in control systems integration, process automation, computer system
validation and IT solutions. Our Control Systems segment also acquired Datasweep, Inc., a provider
of production management software, in December2005. The results of operations of the acquired businesses have been included in our Consolidated
Statement of Operations since the dates of acquisition. Pro forma financial information and
allocation of the purchase price is not presented as the effects of these acquisitions are not
material to our results of operations and financial position. In March2006, our Control Systems segment sold the assets of our ElectroCraft Engineered

During 2006, in connection with the final purchase price allocations of Quality Rewind,
Datasweep, Inc. and CIE see Note 2, we recorded intangible assets of $217million, of which $90
million was assigned to computer software products and $19million to intangible assets not
subject to amortization. The remainder is classified as other intangible assets. Our preliminary
purchase price allocation associated with our acquisition of GEPA mbH includes an allocation of
$18million to computer software products and $12million to other intangible assets. Computer software products amortization expense was $164million in 2006, $148million in
2005 and $160million in 2004. The Allen-Bradley, Reliance, Reliance ElectricTM, Dodge and CIETM
trademarks have an indefinite life, and therefore are not subject to amortization. Estimated amortization expense is $261million in 2007, $241million in 2008, $172million
in 2009, $86million in 2010, and $74million in 2011.   4.

We issued an aggregate of $800million principal amount of our 615% notes, 670% debentures
and 520% debentures in January1998. The debt offering yielded approximately $7500million of
proceeds. We issued the 520% debentures at a discount, and the 615% notes and 670% debentures
at par. In September2002, we entered into an interest rate swap contract the Swap that effectively
converted our $3500million aggregate principal amount of 615% notes, payable in 2008, to
floating rate debt based on six-month LIBOR. The floating rate was 802percent at September30,
2006 and 623percent at September30, 2005. As permitted by SFAS No133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133, as amended, we have designated the Swap
as a fair value hedge. Accordingly, the fair value of the Swap was recorded in other liabilities
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the
underlying debt at September30, 2006 and 2005. The fair value of the Swap, based upon quoted
market prices for contracts with similar maturities, was a liability of $68million at September
30, 2006 and a liability of $63million at September30, 2005. On October26, 2004, we entered into a five-year $6000million unsecured revolving credit
facility. On September29, 2006, we entered into a 364-day $2500million unsecured revolving
credit facility. Both credit facilities remain in effect and we have not drawn down under either
of them at September30, 2006 or 2005. Borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest based
on short-term money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding. The
terms of these credit facilities contain covenants under which we would be in default if our
debt-to-total-capital ratio was to exceed 60percent. We were in compliance with all covenants
under these credit facilities at September30, 2006 and 2005. In addition to our $6000 and $2500
million credit facilities, short-term unsecured credit facilities of approximately $1252million
at September30, 2006 were available to foreign subsidiaries. There were no significant commitment
fees or compensating balance requirements under any of our credit facilities. Borrowings under our
credit facilities during 2006 were not significant. Interest payments were $604million during 2006, $456million during 2005 and $409million
during 2004. 45 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   7.

runs for twelve months from either the date of sale or from installation to an end-user or OEM
customer. We also record a liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and
reasonably estimable. Our product warranty obligations are included in other current liabilities

We base the fair value of long-term debt upon quoted market prices for the same or similar
issues. We base the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts on quoted market
prices for contracts with similar maturities. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts provide for the purchase or sale of foreign
currencies at specified future dates at specified exchange rates. At September30, 2006 and 2005,
we had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts
relating to the euro, British pound sterling, South Korean won and Swiss franc. The foreign
currency forward exchange contracts are recorded in other current assets in the amounts of $19
million as of September30, 2006 and $222million as of September30, 2005 and other current
liabilities in the amounts of $85million as of September30, 2006 and $40million as of
September30, 2005. We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our results of operations
or financial position relating to these foreign currency forward exchange contracts. We have
designated certain foreign currency forward exchange contracts related to forecasted intercompany
transactions as cash flow hedges. The amount recognized in earnings as a result of the
ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges was not significant. We also hold financial instruments consisting of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and short-term debt. The carrying value of these assets and liabilities as reported in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate fair value. 46 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   10.
Shareowners Equity Common Stock At September30, 2006, the authorized stock of the Company consisted of one billion shares of
common stock, par value $100 per share, and 25million shares of preferred stock, without par
value. At September30, 2006, 170million shares of common stock were reserved for various
incentive plans. Changes in outstanding common shares are summarized as follows in millions

During September2006, we repurchased 04million shares of common stock for $206
million that did not settle until October2006. These outstanding purchases were recorded in
accounts payable at September30, 2006. Preferred Share Purchase Rights Each outstanding share of common stock provides the holder with one Preferred Share Purchase
Right Right. The Rights will become exercisable only if a person or group, without the approval
of the board of directors, acquires, or offers to acquire, 20percent or more of the common stock,
although the board of directors is authorized to reduce the 20percent threshold for triggering the
Rights to not less than 10percent. Upon exercise, each Right entitles the holder to 1/100th of a
share of SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Company Junior Preferred Stock at a
price of $250, subject to adjustment. Upon an acquisition of the Company, each Right other than Rights held by the acquirer will
generally be exercisable for $500 worth of either common stock of the Company or common stock of
the acquirer for $250. In certain circumstances, each Right may be exchanged by the Company for
one share of common stock or 1/100th of a share of Junior Preferred Stock. The Rights will expire
on December6, 2006. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Accumulated other comprehensive loss consists of in millions

losses and gains, respectively, on the hedged items. Approximately $13million $08million after tax of the net unrealized losses on cash flow
hedges as of September30, 2006 will be reclassified into earnings during 2007. We expect that
these unrealized losses will be offset when the hedged items are recognized in earnings. 47 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   11.
Share-Based Compensation Effective October1, 2005, we adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective application
transition method. Before we adopted SFAS 123R, we accounted for share-based compensation in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. Other than for restricted stock, no share-based employee compensation cost was reflected
in net income before October1, 2005. SFAS 123R requires us to report the tax benefit from the
tax deduction related to share-based compensation that is in excess of recognized compensation
costs excess tax benefits as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. Before
October1, 2005 we reported the entire tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options as an
operating cash flow. During 2006, we recognized $295million in share-based compensation expense. The total
income tax benefit recognized related to share-based compensation during 2006 was $103million.
We recognize compensation expense on grants of share-based compensation awards on a straight-line
basis over the service period of each award recipient. As of September30, 2006, total
unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based compensation awards was $306million, net of
estimated forfeitures, which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of approximately
13years. Our 2000 Long-Term Incentives Plan, as amended, authorizes us to deliver up to 24million
shares of our common stock upon exercise of stock options, or upon grant or in payment of stock
appreciation rights, performance shares, performance units and restricted stock. Our 2003 Directors
Stock Plan, as amended, authorizes us to deliver up to 05million shares of our common stock upon
exercise of stock options or upon grant of shares of our common and restricted stock.
Approximately 59million shares under our 2000 Long-Term Incentives Plan and 04million shares
under our 2003 Directors Stock Plan remain available for future grant or payment at September30,
2006. We use treasury stock to deliver shares of our common stock under these plans. Our 2000
Long-Term Incentives Plan does not permit share-based compensation awards to be granted after
November30, 2009. Stock Options We have granted non-qualified and incentive stock options to purchase our common stock under
various incentive plans at prices equal to the fair market value of the stock on the grant dates.
The exercise price for some options granted under the plans may be paid in cash, shares of common
stock or a combination of cash and shares. Stock options expire ten years after the grant date and
vest ratably over three years. The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended
September30, 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $1767, $1260 and $720, respectively. We estimated the
fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model and the
following assumptions

The average risk-free interest rate is based on the five-year U.S. treasury security rate in
effect as of the grant date. The expected dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend
as a percentage of the market value of our common stock as of the grant date. We determined
expected volatility using a weighted average of daily historical volatility 90percent of our
stock price over the past four years the period since our spinoff of Rockwell Collins, Inc. and
implied volatility 10percent based upon exchange traded options for our common stock. We
determined that a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility better reflects future
market conditions and better indicates expected volatility than purely historical volatility. We
determined the expected term of the stock options using historical data adjusted for the estimated
exercise dates of unexercised options. 48 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   11.

Performance Share Awards Certain officers and key employees are also eligible to receive shares of our common stock in
payment of performance share awards granted to them. During 2006, 143,100 performance share awards
were granted for which up to 286,200 shares of our common stock could be delivered in payment.
Grantees of performance shares will be eligible to receive shares of our common stock depending
upon our total shareowner return, assuming reinvestment of all dividends, relative to the
performance of the SP 500 over a three-year period. No performance share awards were outstanding
as of September30, 2005. At September30, 2006, 140,500 performance shares were outstanding. The per share fair value of performance shares granted during the year ended September30,

December 2004. Restricted Stock We also grant restricted stock awards to certain employees. Restrictions lapse over periods
ranging from three to five years. We value restricted stock awards at the closing market value of
our common stock on the date of grant. A summary of restricted stock activity for the years ended September30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 are as follows

Share-Based Compensation Continued Pro forma net income for 2005 includes an additional $49million after tax of compensation
expense, recognized in the second quarter of 2005, for retirement eligible stock option
participants. Previously we reported compensation expense for these participants over the vesting
period. Stock options granted to retirement eligible plan participants who retire under our
retirement plans on or after the first anniversary of the grant date continue to vest
post-retirement in accordance with plan provisions and agreements related thereto. If the plan
participant retires less than twelve months from the grant date, the options under that grant are
forfeited. Stock compensation expense on grants to plan participants who are retirement eligible
on the grant date or who will be retirement eligible in less than twelve months from the grant date
is reported in pro forma net income over the twelve month period from the grant date. We report
stock compensation expense on grants to plan participants who become retirement eligible between
twelve and thirty-six months after the grant date in pro forma net income over the period from
grant date to the retirement eligibility date. Pro forma net income for 2004 includes $36million after tax of expense related to
performance-vesting options that vested in the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the market
price on our common stock reaching a specified level for a pre-determined period of time. Net
income, as reported and pro forma net income in 2004 include $29million before and after tax of
compensation expense resulting from modifications made to certain stock options in connection with
the sale of our FirstPoint Contact business.   12.
Retirement Benefits We sponsor funded and unfunded pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for our
employees. The pension plans cover most of our employees and provide for monthly pension payments
to eligible employees after retirement. Pension benefits for salaried employees generally are
based on years of credited service and average earnings. Pension benefits for hourly employees are
primarily based on specified benefit amounts and years of service. Our policy with respect to
funding our pension obligations is to fund the minimum amount required by applicable laws and
governmental regulations. We may, however, at our discretion, fund amounts in excess of the
minimum amount required by laws and regulations, as we did in 2006 and 2005. Other postretirement
benefits are primarily in the form of retirement medical plans that cover most of our United States
employees and provide for the payment of certain medical costs of eligible employees and dependents
after retirement. The components of net periodic benefit cost are in millions

million for the year ended September30, 2004, and pre-tax other postretirement benefit cost of
$11million for the year ended September30, 2004, related to FirstPoint Contact. We retained the
pension liability related to eligible FirstPoint Contact participants and the other postretirement
benefit liability for eligible retirees through the date of sale, which will result in ongoing net
periodic benefit cost for us. Also in 2004, we recognized a pension curtailment loss of $04
million and an other postretirement benefits curtailment gain of $23million related to the sale
of our FirstPoint Contact business that is reflected in Income from discontinued operations in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations. 51 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   12.

During 2006, we recorded a decrease to our minimum pension liability of $6561million
resulting primarily from the discount rate change and the $4500million contribution to our U.S.
qualified pension plan in 2006. The decrease of our minimum pension liability and related deferred
tax asset resulted in a net increase to shareowners equity reflected as a decrease in accumulated
other comprehensive loss of $4013million. In 2005, we amended our U.S. pension plan effective for 2006 to eliminate the early retirement
subsidy for certain employees. The effect of the amendment is a reduction in the pension
obligation of approximately $70million recognized in 2005 and a corresponding reduction in annual
pension expense recognized over the average remaining service life of plan participants. In 2006, we made voluntary contributions of $4500million to our U.S. qualified pension plan
trust. In 2005, we contributed $1500million to our U.S. qualified pension plan trust. 52 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   12.
Retirement Benefits Continued The accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans is $2,1644million as of the 2006
measurement date and $2,3571million as of the 2005 measurement date. We use an actuarial measurement date of June30 to measure our benefit obligations, plan
assets and to calculate our net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement
benefits. Net Periodic Benefit Cost Assumptions Significant assumptions used in determining net periodic benefit cost for the period ended
September30 are in weighted averages

The healthcare cost trend rate reflects the estimated increase in gross
medical claims costs as required to be disclosed by SFAS No132, Employers Disclosures
about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. As a result of the plan amendment
adopted effective October1, 2002, our effective per person retiree medical cost
increase is zero percent beginning in 2005 for the majority of our postretirement
benefit plans. For our other plans, we assume gross healthcare cost trend rate will
decrease to 55% in 2011.   2
Decreasing to 425% in 2011. 53 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   12.
Retirement Benefits Continued Effective October1, 2002, we amended our United States postretirement healthcare benefit
program in order to mitigate the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare services. Effective
January1, 2004, we began contributing 50percent of the amount in excess of the 2003 per capita
amount. However, our calendar 2004 contribution was limited to a 75percent increase from the
2003 per capita amount. Effective January1, 2005, we limit our future per capita maximum
contribution to our calendar 2004 per capita contribution. As a result of the finalization during 2005 of the rules for the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act, we have included an additional reduction in
our accumulated projected benefit obligation of $135million as of September30, 2005, which is
being amortized to expense over the average remaining service life. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we equally consider
the historical performance and the future expected performance for returns for each asset category,
as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolios. This resulted in the selection
of the weighted average long-term rate of return on assets assumption. Our global weighted-average
asset allocations at September30, by asset category, are

The investment objective for pension funds related to our defined benefit plans is to meet the
plans benefit obligations, while maximizing the long-term growth of assets without undue risk. We
strive to achieve this objective by investing plan assets within target allocation ranges and
diversification within asset categories. Target allocation ranges are guidelines that are adjusted
periodically based on ongoing monitoring by plan fiduciaries. Investment risk is controlled by
rebalancing to target allocations on a periodic basis and ongoing monitoring of investment manager
performance relative to the investment guidelines established for each manager. As of September30, 2006 and 2005, our pension plans do not own our common stock. In certain non-U.S. countries in which we operate, there are no legal requirements or
financial incentives provided to companies to pre-fund pension obligations. In these instances, we
typically make benefit payments directly from cash as they become due, rather than by creating a
separate pension fund. Estimated Future Payments We expect to contribute approximately $500million related to our worldwide pension plans and
$239million to our postretirement benefit plans in 2007. The following benefit payments, which include employees expected future service, as
applicable, are expected to be paid in millions

Rocky Flats In 2006, we recorded a $50million $30million after-tax accrual for legal contingencies
related to our former aerospace and defense businesses operation of the Rocky Flats facility for
the U.S. Department of Energy. In 2004, we recorded a benefit of $76million $46million after tax as a result of a
final judgment in a defense claim legal proceeding related to our former aerospace and defense
businesses operation of the Rocky Flats facility for the U.S. Department of Energy. 55 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   13.
Discontinued Operations Continued FirstPoint Contact In 2004, we sold our FirstPoint Contact business for cash proceeds and a note convertible into
a minority interest in the corporate parent of the buyer. The value assigned to the convertible
note on the date of the transaction was approximately $270million. In September2005, the note
was converted to non-voting equity shares, accounted for under the cost method. The historical cost
value of $270million was used to value the equity shares at the date of conversion. In July2006
we received a cash dividend of $255million in respect of the equity shares resulting from a
recapitalization and distribution of cash to shareholders and management. We recorded dividend
income of $14million and the remaining $241million as a return of capital. Our value of the
equity shares recorded at September30, 2006 is $29million. No fair value is available for this
investment as the equity shares are not publicly traded. Accordingly, it is not practicable to
estimate fair value. The results of operations of FirstPoint Contact for 2004, as well as the gain on the sale, are
reflected in Loss income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations. Summarized results of FirstPoint Contact are as follows in millions

Related Party Transactions In September2006, we and Rockwell Collins, Inc. Rockwell Collins sold our investment in
RSC for an aggregate of $1675million in cash. Prior to the date of sale, we and Rockwell
Collins each owned 50percent of RSC. As part of the transaction, among other things, we retained
certain licenses for intellectual property owned by RSC. Additionally, we incurred expenses and
funded certain RSC cash balances in connection with the sale and are obligated to pay to RSC $28
million in 2007 and $12million in 2009. We recorded a gain on sale of $199million $120
million after tax, or $007 per share. We have an agreement with RSC pursuant to which RSC performs research and development services
for us, expiring on September30, 2009. We incurred $23million in 2006, $28million in 2005 and
$37million in 2004 for research and development services performed by RSC. At September30, 2006
and 2005, the amounts due to or from RSC were not significant. During 2006, we sold a portion of our ownership interest in CoLinx, LLC CoLinx, a company
that provides logistics and e-commerce services, resulting in a gain of $08million, and reducing
our ownership interest from 25percent to 20percent. We account for this ownership interest using
the equity method. We paid CoLinx $216million in 2006, $182million in 2005 and $171million
in 2004, primarily for logistics services. In addition, CoLinx paid us approximately $38million
in 2006, $28million in 2005 and $22million in 2004 for the use of facilities we own and other
services. The amounts due to and from CoLinx at September30, 2006 and 2005 were not significant. 56 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   15.

closure of the U.S. federal audit cycle for the years 2003 and 2004 and various state tax
audits

relating to cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the
transfer price for products, services and/or intellectual property; and   
$272million related to the reversal of valuation allowances on capital loss carryforwards. During 2005, we recognized net tax benefits resulting from   
$197million in income from continuing operations related to the resolution of claims
and other tax matters as well as the effect of the true-up of estimated tax audit
contingency accruals in connection with the closure of the U.S. federal audit cycle for the

assets through the reduction of future taxable income, other than as reflected below for tax
attributes to be carried forward. Significant factors we considered in determining the probability
of the realization of the deferred tax assets include our historical operating results $6435

We have a valuation allowance at September30, 2006 as noted above for carryforwards
for which future use is less than more likely than not. During 2006, the valuation allowance increased by $70million as a result of audit
settlements and decreased by $272million as a result of the planned utilization of capital loss
carryforwards related to the sale of our investment in RSC and our planned sale of our Dodge
mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses. During 2005, the valuation allowance decreased by $75million as a result of a basis
adjustment in connection with the filing of the 2004 income tax return related to the sale of
FirstPoint Contact and the recording of a valuation allowance for non-U.S. net operating losses. We operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by various
U.S. Federal, state and foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods. Additionally, we have
retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of
businesses in prior years. Our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of
the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Due to the
subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction, the differences and
interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating
the final resolution of complex tax audit matters, our estimates of income tax liabilities may
differ from actual payments or assessments. Cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for
products, services, and/or intellectual property as well as various U.S. state tax matters comprise
our more significant income tax exposures. We regularly assess our position with regard to tax
exposures and record liabilities for these uncertain tax positions and related interest and
penalties, if any, according to the principles of SFAS No5, Accounting for Contingencies. We
have recorded an accrual of $851million and $1031million at September30, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, that reflects our estimate of the likely outcome of current and future audits. The
accrual is recorded in Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The net change in the
accrual of $180million reflects a reduction of $183million related to the settlement
of the 2003 2004 U.S. federal audit and various state audits,
a net $133million reduction due to changes in estimates related
to current year audit developments, and a $136million increase
primarily related to current year taxes and interest on previously
identified income tax exposures. A final determination
of these tax audits or changes in our estimates may result in additional future income tax expense
or benefit. 59 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   16.

We have not provided U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative earnings of non-U.S. affiliates that
have been reinvested indefinitely. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and at September30,
2006, were approximately $7460million. Because of the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits,
it is not practicable to determine the U.S. or state income tax liabilities that would be payable
if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely. Deferred taxes are provided for non-U.S.
affiliates when we plan to remit those earnings. Income taxes paid were $2147million during 2006, $1348million during 2005 and $300
million during 2004.   17.
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities Environmental Matters Federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the
environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the environment have
and will continue to have an effect on our manufacturing operations. Thus far, compliance with
environmental requirements and resolution of environmental claims have been accomplished without
material effect on our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or financial
condition. We have been designated as a potentially responsible party at 14 Superfund sites, excluding
sites as to which our records disclose no involvement or as to which our potential liability has
been finally determined and assumed by third parties. We estimate the total reasonably possible
costs we could incur for the remediation of Superfund sites at September30, 2006 to be $104
million, of which $33million has been accrued. Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been asserted against us alleging
violations of federal, state and local environmental protection requirements, or seeking
remediation of alleged environmental impairments, principally at previously owned properties. As
of September30, 2006, we have estimated the total reasonably possible costs we could incur from
these matters to be $787million. We have recorded environmental accruals for these matters of
$329million. In addition to the above matters, we assumed certain other environmental
liabilities in connection with the 1995 acquisition of Reliance. We are indemnified by ExxonMobil
Corporation Exxon for substantially all costs associated with these matters. The indemnity
applies to liabilities for which we give Exxon notice by December29, 2006. At September30, 2006,
we have recorded a liability of $224million and a receivable of $213million for these matters.
We estimate the total reasonably possible costs for these matters to be $270million for which we
are substantially indemnified by Exxon. 60 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   17.
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities Continued Based on our assessment, we believe that our expenditures for environmental capital investment
and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection and
other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material adverse
effect on our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or financial condition. We
cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements. Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations Effective September30, 2006, we adopted FIN 47, which clarifies the guidance included in SFAS
No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143. Under FIN 47, companies must
accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible
long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal
operation of the long-lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not
conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional. Identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation
of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities. We estimated conditional
asset retirement obligations using site-specific knowledge and historical industry expertise. The
application of FIN 47 resulted in a charge, net of tax, of $181million included in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September30, 2006 as the cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle. The liability for conditional asset retirement obligations
recognized at September30, 2006 as the result of the application of FIN 47 was $293million and
is recorded in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Pro forma amounts, as if FIN 47 had been applied for all periods, are dollars in millions,
except per share amounts

Commitments from third parties under sublease agreements having noncancelable lease
terms in excess of one year aggregated $103million as of September30, 2006 and are receivable
through 2009 at approximately $33million per year. Most leases contain renewal options for
varying periods, and certain leases include options to purchase the leased property. 61 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   17.
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities Continued Lease Commitments Continued During 2006, we completed a sale-leaseback transaction of 24 properties, including the land,
buildings and improvements affixed to the properties. The lease terms vary from five to fifteen
years depending on the property and are classified as operating leases. The net proceeds on sale
were approximately $1475million. Three of the sold properties resulted in a loss of $18million
that we recognized during 2006, with the remaining properties resulting in a gain on sale of $369
million that will be amortized to rent expense over the term of the respective leases. The net
book value of the sold assets have been removed from our balance sheet, except for three properties
where we have retained a right to re-acquire a subdivided portion of adjacent vacant land. For
these properties, we will remove the assets from our balance sheet upon re-conveyance of the vacant
land or termination of our right. The net proceeds related to these three properties of $186
million are reported in other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. During 2004, we sold a facility in a sale-leaseback transaction with a third party resulting
in a $206million pre-tax loss. The net cash proceeds from the sale were $190million. Other Matters Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us
relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product liability, safety
and health, intellectual property, employment and contract matters. Although the outcome of
litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be
disposed of unfavorably to us, we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or have been
asserted will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. We including our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal
injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many
years ago. Currently there are thousands of claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants,
together with hundreds of other companies. The great bulk of the complaints, however, do not
identify any of our products or specify which of these claimants, if any, were exposed to asbestos
attributable to our products; and past experience has shown that the vast majority of the claimants
will never identify any of our products. In addition, when our products appear to be identified,
they are frequently from divested businesses, and we are indemnified for most of the costs. For
those claimants who do show that they worked with our products, we nevertheless believe we have
meritorious defenses, in substantial part due to the integrity of our products, the encapsulated
nature of any asbestos-containing components, and the lack of any impairing medical condition on
the part of many claimants. We defend those cases vigorously. Historically, we have been
dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants. We have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense costs, over
and above self-insured retentions, for most of these claims. We initiated litigation in the
Milwaukee County Circuit Court on February12, 2004 to enforce the insurance policies against
Nationwide Indemnity Company and Kemper Insurance, the insurance carriers that provided insurance
coverage to our former Allen-Bradley subsidiary. As a result, the insurance carriers have paid
some past defense and indemnity costs and have agreed to pay the substantial majority of future
defense and indemnity costs for Allen-Bradley asbestos claims, subject to policy limits. If either
carrier becomes insolvent or the policy limits of either carrier are exhausted, our share of future
defense and indemnity costs may increase. However, coverage under excess policies may be available
to pay some or all of these costs. 62 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   17.
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities Continued The uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation and the long term solvency of our insurance
companies make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims. That
uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting
asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process. Subject to these uncertainties and based on
our experience defending asbestos claims, we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition. In connection with the divestiture of our former aerospace and defense businesses the AD
Business to The Boeing Company Boeing, we agreed to indemnify Boeing for certain matters related
to operations of the AD Business for periods prior to the divestiture. In connection with the
spinoffs of our former automotive component systems business, semiconductor systems business and
Rockwell Collins avionics and communications business, the spun-off companies have agreed to
indemnify us for substantially all contingent liabilities related to the respective businesses,
including environmental and intellectual property matters. We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses. In connection with such
divestitures, lawsuits, claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to
the period that we owned the businesses. In many countries we provide a limited intellectual property indemnity as part of our terms
and conditions of sale. We also at times provide limited intellectual property indemnities in
other contracts with third parties, such as contracts concerning: the development and manufacture
of our products; the divestiture of businesses; and the licensing of intellectual property. Due to
the number of agreements containing such provisions, we are unable to estimate the maximum
potential future payments. However, we believe that future payments, if any, would not be material
to our business or financial condition. In 2007 we plan to execute on certain cost productivity initiatives. These initiatives will
likely include workforce reductions and facility rationalization. These actions are consistent
with the planned divestiture of most of our Power Systems operating segment and our globalization
and cost productivity efforts. Costs associated with these actions will be recorded when the
relevant recognition criteria have been met.   18.
Business Segment Information Rockwell Automation is a provider of industrial automation power, control and information
products and services. We are organized based upon products and services and have two operating
segments: Control Systems and Power Systems. Control Systems The Control Systems operating segment supplies industrial automation products, systems,
software and services focused on helping customers control and improve manufacturing processes.
Control Systems includes two main business groups: the Components and Packaged Applications Group
CPAGand the Automation Control and Information Group ACIG. CPAG supplies industrial components, power control and motor management products, and packaged
and engineered products and systems. It supplies motor starters, contactors, push buttons,
signaling devices, termination and protection devices, relays and timers, condition sensors,
adjustable speed drives, motor control centers and drive systems. CPAGs sales account for
approximately 39percent of Control Systems sales. ACIGs core products are used primarily to control and monitor industrial plants and processes
and typically consist of a processor, software and input/output I/O devices. ACIGs integrated
architecture and Logix controllers perform multiple types of control applications, including
discrete, batch, continuous process, drive system, motion and machine safety across various factory
floor operations. ACIGs products include controllers, control platforms, software, I/O devices,
high performance rotary and linear motion control systems, electronic operator interface devices,
sensors, industrial computers and machine safety components. ACIGs sales account for
approximately 45percent of Control Systems sales. In addition, Control Systems offerings also include services and solutions, such as
multi-vendor customer support, training, automation systems integration, asset management, and
manufacturing information solutions for discrete and targeted batch process industries. 63 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   18.
Business Segment Information Continued Effective October1, 2006, we have realigned our internal management reporting structure. The
reporting structure changes include realignment of our Control Systems services and solutions
offerings to report through the Components and Packaged Applications Group CPAGbusiness group.
Additionally, the Power Systems drives and drives related parts and services business has been
realigned to also report through the CPAG business group. As a result of changes in the internal
management reporting structure, we will begin reporting the historical Control Systems operating
segment as two separate operating segments in our first quarter of 2007. Power Systems The Power Systems operating segment consists of two business groups: Dodge mechanical
Mechanical and Reliance electrical Electrical. Mechanicals products include mounted bearings, gear reducers, mechanical drives, conveyor
pulleys, couplings, bushings, clutches and motor brakes. Electricals products include industrial
and engineered motors, adjustable speed drives, product repair, motor and mechanical maintenance
solutions, training and consulting services to OEMs, end-users and distributors. The following tables reflect the sales and operating results of our reportable segments for
the years ended September30 in millions

Among other considerations, we evaluate performance and allocate resources based upon segment
operating earnings before income taxes, interest expense, costs related to corporate offices,
certain non-recurring corporate initiatives, gains and losses from the disposition of businesses,
earnings and losses from equity affiliates that are not considered part of the operations of a
particular segment and incremental acquisition related expenses resulting from purchase accounting
adjustments such as intangible asset amortization, depreciation, inventory and purchased research
and development charges. Depending on the product, intersegment sales are either at a market price
or cost plus a mark-up, which does not necessarily represent a market price. In preparing the
segment information, we use accounting policies consistent with those described in Note 1. 64 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   18.

c
Income from continuing operations for 2005 includes special charges of $215million
$142million after tax, or $008 per diluted share associated with realignment of
administrative functions and a reduction of workforce in Europe in our Control Systems
segment and a facility closure in our Power Systems segment. Segment operating earnings of
Control Systems and Power Systems include these special charges of $165million and $50
million, respectively, for the quarter ended September30, 2005. The special charges are
included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September30, 2005
in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses in the amounts of $94
million and $121million, respectively. Total cash expenditures after-tax in connection
with these actions were approximately $114million related to employee severance and
separation costs. Non-cash charges of $28million after-tax relate to a write-down of
property to its fair value, determined by management using customary valuation techniques.

Subsequent Events In June2006, we announced our intention to divest our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric
motors and motor repair services businesses. These are the principal businesses of our Power
Systems operating segment. From the date of our announcement through
our fiscal year end, we have received expressions of interest from potential buyers, conducted management
presentations and responded to buyer due diligence activities.
Subsequent to our fiscal year end we have received bids from
prospective buyers and completed contract negotiations. On
November7, 2006, we announced that we have entered into a
definitive agreement to sell these businesses to Baldor Electric
Company for $18billion, comprised of $175billion in
cash and $50million in Baldor common stock. We expect to
recognize a gain from the transaction. The transactions effective tax
rate will be lower than our statutory tax rate. The
transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory
approval and is expected to close in the second quarter of our fiscal
2007. In
subsequent filings these businesses will be
reported as discontinued operations. The assets and liabilities
of these businesses to be sold are

68 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of
Rockwell Automation, Inc.
Milwaukee, Wisconsin We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rockwell Automation, Inc. and
subsidiaries the Company as of September30, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareowners equity, cash flows, and comprehensive income for each of the
three years in the period ended September30, 2006. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at a2. These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries at September30, 2006 and
2005, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended September30, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered
in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein. As described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on October1, 2005, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No123R, Shared Based Payments. As described
in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on September30, 2006, the Company adopted
FASB Interpretation No47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting
as of September30, 2006, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated November9, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness
of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. s/ Deloitte Touche LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness, as of September
30, 2006, of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule13a-15e and Rule
15d-15e of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
September30, 2006. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as defined in Rule13a-15f under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based upon that evaluation, management
has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September30,
2006. Our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
September30, 2006 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included on the following page. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of the changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting as such term
is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f during the quarter ended September30, 2006 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting. In 2005, we began planning to develop common global process standards and an enterprise-wide
information technology system. During 2006, we began the implementation phase, which included a
pilot roll-out to one of our small manufacturing locations. Additional roll-outs will occur to
most locations of our company over a multi-year period, with the next phase scheduled for fiscal
2007. As the phased roll-out occurs, we will experience changes in internal control over financial
reporting each quarter. No significant changes occurred during the year ended September30, 2006
related to this program. 70 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of
Rockwell Automation, Inc.
Milwaukee, Wisconsin We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September30, 2006,
based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of the changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of September30, 2006, is fairly stated, in
all material respects, based on the criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our
opinion, Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of September30, 2006, based on the criteria
established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of
and for the year ended September30, 2006 of the Company and our
report dated November9, 2006,
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule and
included an explanatory paragraph relating to the Companys adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No123R, Shared Based Payments and of FASB Interpretation No47, Accounting
for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. s/ Deloitte Touche LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin
