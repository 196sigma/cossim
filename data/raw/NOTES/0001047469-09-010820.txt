Item8. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 
Revenue Recognition 
We recognize revenue upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers. Accordingly, we recognize revenue for software titles when there
is 1persuasive evidence that an arrangement with the customer exists, which is generally based on a customer purchase order, 2the product is delivered, 3the selling price
is fixed or determinable and 4collection of the customer receivable is deemed probable. Our payment arrangements with customers typically provide net 30 and 60day terms. Advances
received for licensing and exclusivity arrangements are reported on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations, at which point we recognize the
revenue. 
Some
of our software products provide limited online functionality at no additional cost to the consumer. Generally, we consider such features to be incidental to the overall product offering and an
inconsequential deliverable. Accordingly, we do not defer revenue related to products containing such online features. We determine whether our products contain substantial online functionality by
evaluating the significance of the development effort and the nature of the online features, the extent of anticipated marketing focus on the online features, the significance of the online features
to the customers' anticipated overall gameplay experience, and the significance of our post sale obligations to customers. Overall, online play functionality is still an emerging area for us, and we
continue to monitor this developing functionality and its significance to our products. 
In
addition, some of our software products are sold exclusively as downloads of digital content for which the consumer takes possession of the digital content for a fee. Revenue from product downloads
is generally recognized when the download is made available assuming all other recognition criteria are met. 
Certain
of our software products include in-game advertising for third party products. Advance payments received for in-game advertising are reported on the balance sheet as
deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations, at which point we recognize the revenue, which is generally at the time of the initial release of the product. 
Revenue
is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns, price concessions and other allowances. In circumstances when we do not have a reliable basis to estimate returns and price
concessions or are unable to determine that collection of a receivable is probable, we defer the revenue until such time as we can reliably estimate any related returns and allowances and determine
that collection of the receivable is probable. 
Allowances for Returns, Price Concessions and Other Allowances 
We accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements. Following reductions in the price of our products, we
grant price concessions to permit customers to take credits against amounts they owe us with respect to merchandise unsold by them. Our customers must satisfy certain conditions to entitle them to
return products or receive price concessions, including compliance with applicable payment terms and confirmation of field inventory levels. 
Our
distribution arrangements with customers do not give them the right to return titles or to cancel firm orders. However, we sometimes accept returns from our distribution customers for stock
balancing and 
36 
Table of Contents make
accommodations to customers, which include credits and returns, when demand for specific titles falls below expectations. 
We
make estimates of future product returns and price concessions related to current period product revenue. We estimate the amount of future returns and price concessions for published titles based
upon, among other factors, historical experience and performance of the titles in similar genres, historical performance of the hardware platform, customer inventory levels, analysis of
sell-through rates, sales force and retail customer feedback, industry pricing, market conditions and changes in demand and acceptance of our products by consumers. Significant
management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price concessions in any accounting period. We believe we can make
reliable estimates of returns and price concessions. However, actual results may differ from initial estimates as a result of changes in circumstances, market conditions and assumptions. Adjustments
to estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. 
Software Development Costs and Licenses 
Capitalized software development costs include direct costs incurred for internally developed titles and payments made to third party software
developers under development agreements. 
We
capitalize internal software development costs including stock-based compensation, specifically identifiable employee payroll expense and incentive compensation costs related to the completion and
release of titles, third party production and other content costs, subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a software title. Technological feasibility of a product includes the
completion of both technical design documentation and game design documentation. Significant management judgment and estimates are utilized in establishing technological feasibility. 
We
enter into agreements with third party developers that require us to make payments for game development and production services. In exchange for these payments, we receive the exclusive publishing
and distribution rights to the finished game title as well as, in some cases, the underlying intellectual property rights. Such agreements allow us to fully recover these payments to the developers at
an agreed upon royalty rate earned on the subsequent retail sales of such software, net of any agreed upon costs. We capitalize all development and production service payments to third party
developers as software development costs. On a product-by-product basis, we reduce software development costs and record a corresponding amount of research and development
expense for any costs incurred by third party developers prior to establishing technological feasibility of a product. We typically enter into agreements with third party developers after completing
the technical design documentation for our products and therefore record the design costs leading up to a signed development contract as research and development expense. When we contract with third
party developers, we generally select third party developers that have proven technology and experience in the genre of the software being developed, which often allows for the establishment of
technological feasibility early in the development cycle. In instances where the documentation of the design and technology are not in place prior to an executed contract, we monitor the software
development process and require our third party developers to adhere to the same technological feasibility standards that apply to our internally developed products. 
Licenses
consist of payments and guarantees made to holders of intellectual property rights for use of their trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights in the development of our
products. Agreements with license holders generally provide for guaranteed minimum royalty payments for use of their intellectual property. Guaranteed minimum payments are initially recorded as an
asset licenses and as a liability accrued licenses upon execution of a licensing agreement, provided that no significant performance remains to be completed by the licensor. When significant
performance remains to be completed by the licensor, we record payments when actually paid. 
37 
Table of Contents
Certain
licenses, especially those related to our sports products, extend over multi-year periods and encompass multiple game titles. In addition to guaranteed minimum payments, these
licenses frequently contain provisions that could require us to pay royalties to the license holder based on pre-agreed unit sales thresholds. 
Amortization
of capitalized software development costs and licenses commences when a product is released and is recorded on a title-by-title basis in cost of goods sold. For
capitalized software development costs, amortization is calculated using 1the proportion of current year revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the life of the title or
2the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful life of the title, whichever is greater. For capitalized licenses, amortization is calculated as a ratio of
1current period revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the remaining life of the title or 2the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales as
defined in the licensing agreement, whichever is greater. 
Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of the recoverability of capitalized software costs. At each balance sheet date, or earlier if an indicator of impairment
exists, we evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software costs, licenses and any other unrecognized minimum commitments that have not been paid, using an undiscounted future cash flow analysis.
We use various measures to evaluate expected product performance and estimate future revenues for our software titles including historical performance of comparable titles; orders for titles prior to
release; and the estimated performance of a sequel title based on the performance of the title on which the sequel is based. When management determines that the value of a title is unlikely to be
recovered by product sales, capitalized costs are charged to cost of goods sold in the period in which such determination is made. 
We
have established profit and unit sales based internal royalty programs that provide for certain of our employees to participate in the success of software titles that they assist in developing.
Royalties earned by employees under this program are recorded as cost of goods sold as they are incurred.  Fair Value Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item to fairly present
our Consolidated Financial
Statements. Without an independent market or another representative transaction, determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult
to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting. 
There
are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value. These include 1the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to
determine the fair value, 2the income approach, which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example, future cash flows or future earnings to a single present amount, and
3the cost approach, which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset. For many of our fair value estimates, including our estimates of the fair value of acquired
intangible assets, we use the income approach. Using the income approach requires the use of financial models, which require us to make various estimates including, but not limited to 1the
potential future cash flows for the asset, liability or equity instrument being measured, 2the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows, 3the time value of money
associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows, and 4the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium. Making these cash flow estimates are inherently
difficult and subjective, and, if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate, our financial results may be negatively impacted.
Furthermore, relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion
reached. For example, a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired. While we are 
38 
Table of Contents required
to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions, the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments:  Inventory Obsolescence.We regularly review inventory quantities on-hand and in the retail channels and record an inventory provision for excess or
obsolete inventory based on the future expected demand for our products. Significant changes in demand for our products would impact management estimates in establishing our inventory provision. We
write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost
of the inventory and market value, based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to assess. 
Business CombinationsGoodwill and Intangible Assets.The purchase method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be
recorded at their fair values on the date of a business acquisition. Our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business from the completion date of an
acquisition. The costs to acquire a business, including transaction, integration and restructuring costs, are allocated to the fair value of net assets acquired upon acquisition. Any excess of the
purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Our assessment of the estimated fair value of
each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives. Furthermore, a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often
has a direct impact on the amount to recognize as goodwill, which is an asset that is not amortized. Often determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of
expected use of the asset, the expected cost to extinguish the liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired in-process
technology. Such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our financial statements. 
We
use either the income, cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions of such fair values and asset lives. The income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net
economic benefit to be received over the life of the asset, discounted to present value. The cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction
cost. The market approach estimates value based on what other participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets. Although each valuation approach is considered in valuing the assets
acquired, the approach ultimately selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of information. 
We
evaluate our goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. The determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant
level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units. Changes in our strategy and/or market conditions could significantly impact these
judgments and require reductions to recorded intangible asset balances. 
Long-lived assets.We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which cash flows are directly related
to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, their amount and the asset residual value, if any. In turn, measurement of an impairment loss requires a
determination of fair value, which is based on the best information available. We use internal discounted cash flow estimates, quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals, as
appropriate, to determine fair value. We derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate. 
39  Table of Contents 
Stock-based Compensation 
Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting
period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including, in the case of stock option awards, estimating expected stock volatility. In addition, judgment
is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our
results of operations could be materially impacted. 
We
have granted stock options to non-employees, which are subject to variable accounting. When variable accounting is applied to stock option grants, we re-measure the fair
value of the unvested options at the end of each reporting period or until the options are cancelled or expire unexercised. Compensation expense in any given period is calculated as the
difference between total earned compensation at the end of the period, less total earned compensation at the beginning of the period, both of which are based on the price of our common stock at such
dates. As a result, fluctuations in the price of our common stock will change compensation expense recognized by us each reporting period. 
We
have also granted time and market-based restricted stock awards to employees and non-employees. Time-based and market-based awards to non-employees are subject
to variable accounting. For the time-based restricted stock grants to non-employees, we cumulatively remeasure the fair value at the end of every period based on the month end
closing price of our common stock. Market-based restricted stock awards vest based on the relative performance of our common stock to a composite index. We calculate the fair value of market-based
restricted stock using a Monte Carlo Simulation method, which requires a substantial number of inputs and estimates of future market conditions and considers the range of various vesting
probabilities. As a result, expense recorded for our non-employee awards can fluctuate substantially from period to period. 
Income Taxes 
We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. The provision for income taxes is computed
using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at currently enacted
statutory tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment. 
We
record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Our cumulative pre-tax loss in recent fiscal years represents
sufficient evidence for us to determine that the establishment of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset is appropriate. This valuation allowance offsets deferred tax assets associated
with future tax deductions as well as carryforward items. 
Our
future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax
assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition, our filed tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We
regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. 
We
recognize and measure uncertain tax positions and record tax benefits when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the
technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement. 
40 
Table of Contents
At
each period end, it is necessary for us to make certain estimates and assumptions to compute the provision for income taxes including allocations of certain transactions to different tax
jurisdictions, amounts of permanent and temporary differences, the likelihood of deferred tax assets being recovered and the outcome of contingent tax risks. These estimates and assumptions are
revised as new events occur, more experience is acquired and additional information is obtained. The impact of these revisions is recorded in income tax expense or benefit in the period in which they
become known. 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
Fair Value Measurements 
In November 2008, the Company adopted the guidance as it pertains to the accounting for financial assets and liabilities as well as other assets and
liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis. The adoption of this guidance did not affect the Company historical consolidated financial statements. For more information, see Note3
to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item8. On November1, 2009 the Company adopted the guidance related to fair value measurements pertaining to
non-financial assets and liabilities on a prospective basis. This guidance established the authoritative definition of fair value, set out a framework for measuring fair value and expanded
the required disclosures about fair value measurement. We have evaluated the non-financial assets and liabilities portion of the guidance and expect that it will have no significant impact
on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
Research and Development 
In November 2008, the Company adopted the guidance related to accounting for the non-refundable portion of a payment made by a research
and development entity for future research and development activities. Under this guidance an entity is required to defer and capitalize non-refundable advance payments made for research
and development activities until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed. The adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, cash flows
or results of operations. 
Business Combinations 
In December 2007, new guidance was issued providing greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations. It
requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction, establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the
measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and requires the acquirer to disclose the nature and financial effect of the business combination. The guidance is effective for
all fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008 November1, 2009 for the Company and interim periods within those years, with earlier adoption prohibited. We do not expect that the
adoption of this guidance will have an material impact on our historical consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of operations. 
In
April 2009, additional guidance was issued which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value, if fair
value can be determined during the measurement period. This guidance specifies that an asset or liability should be recognized at time of acquisition if the amount of the asset or liability can be
reasonably estimated and that it is probable that an asset existed or that a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date. This guidance is effective for all fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2008 November1, 2009 for the Company. 
IntangiblesGoodwill and Other 
In April 2008, new guidance was issued for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset which applies prospectively to intangible
assets acquired individually or with a group of other assets in either an asset acquisition or business combination. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim 
41  Table of Contents periods
within those fiscal years, beginning after December15, 2008 November1, 2009 for the Company, and early adoption is prohibited. We do not expect that the adoption will have a
material effect on our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations. 
Debt 
In May 2008, new guidance was issued specifying that issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion should
separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the Company non-convertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent
periods. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008 November1, 2009 for the Company and prohibits early adoption and
requires retrospective application to all periods presented. In June 2009, we issued $1380million of 4375% convertible senior notes due 2014 Convertible Notes which is classified as
long-term debt at October31, 2009. Upon adoption of this guidance on November1, 2009 we will reclassify $436million of our Convertible Notes balance to additional
paid-in-capital, representing a bifurcation based on the fair value of the Convertible Notes' embedded conversion option. The difference between the principal amount of the
Convertible Notes and the remaining liability component after the bifurcation will be reported as a debt discount. As of November1, 2009 we have begun amortizing the debt discount as non-cash
interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations in addition to the Convertible Notes' coupon interest payments. For additional details of our Convertible Notes see Note9 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Earnings Per Share 
In June 2008, new guidance was issued which clarified that stock-based payment awards that entitle holders to receive non-forfeitable
dividends before they vest should be considered participating securities and included in the basic earnings per share calculation. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years beginning after December15, 2008 November1, 2009 for the Company. We do not believe adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated results of
operations. 
Subsequent Events 
In May 2009, new guidance was issued which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance
sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. In particular, this guidance sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a
reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements; the circumstances under which an entity should recognize
events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements; and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance
sheet date. The guidance was adopted as of the Company third quarter ended July31, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company financial statements.
Subsequent events were evaluated through the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements on December18, 2009 at the time this Annual Report on Form10-K was
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Amendments to Variable Interest Entity Guidance 
In June 2009, new guidance was issued which requires an enterprise to determine whether its variable interest or interests give it a controlling
financial interest in a variable interest entity. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the enterprise that has both 1the power to direct the activities of a variable
interest entity that most significantly impacts the entity economic performance and 2the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable
interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest 
42  Table of Contents entity.
The guidance also now requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. The guidance is effective at the start of a Company
first fiscal year beginning after November15, 2009 November1, 2010 for the Company. We are still evaluating the impact that the adoption of this new guidance will have on our
consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of operations. 
Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value 
In August 2009, new guidance was issued related to the fair value measurement of liabilities. This update provides clarification that in
circumstances in which quoted prices in an active market for the identical liability are not available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using a valuation technique that uses
quoted prices for the identical liability when traded as an asset, quoted prices for similar liabilities when traded as an asset or another technique that is consistent with the Fair Value principles.
The guidance is effective for the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after issuance which for the Company is November1, 2009. We do not expect that the adoption of
this new guidance will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of operations.  Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements 
In October 2009, new guidance was issued related to the accounting for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This guidance amends the existing
guidance for separating consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements and establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. This guidance will become
effective, on a prospective
basis, for the Company on November1, 2011. We are still evaluating the impact that the adoption of this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of
operations. 
Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements 
In October 2009, new guidance was issued that changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements by excluding tangible products containing both
software and non-software components that function together to deliver the product essential functionality and instead have these types of transactions be accounted for under other
accounting literature in order to determine whether the software and non-software components function together to deliver the product essential functionality. This guidance will become
effective, on a prospective basis, for the Company on November1, 2011. We are still evaluating the impact that the adoption of this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial
position, cash flows and results of operations. 
Fluctuations in Operating Results and Seasonality 
We have experienced fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results as a result of: the timing of the introduction of new titles; variations
in sales of titles developed for particular platforms; market acceptance of our titles; development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles, sequels or enhancements of
existing titles; projected and actual changes in platforms; the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors; product returns; changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors;
the size and timing of acquisitions; the timing of orders from major customers; order cancellations; and delays in product shipment. Sales of our products are also seasonal, with peak shipments
typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter our fourth and first fiscal quarters as a result of increased demand for titles during the holiday season. Quarterly and annual comparisons of
operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.

Net revenue decreased $5289million for the year ended October31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008, primarily due to lower sales of Grand Theft Auto IV released in
April 2008 for the PS3 and Xbox360. Sales of our Grand Theft
Auto franchise were $4168million lower for the year ended October31, 2009. The decrease in sales from Grand Theft Auto
IV was partially mitigated by the 2009 releases of Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars, Grand Theft Auto:
Episodes from Liberty City as well as downloadable episodes Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned and Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay
Tony.
Excluding
our Grand Theft Auto franchise, net revenue was lower by $1121million, primarily related to titles that were released in 2008, such
as those in our Midnight Club, Civilization, Carnival
Games and BioShock franchises, which collectively decreased $1280million compared to the prior year. Partially
offsetting the decrease in net revenues was the release of Borderlands in October 2009. 
Net
revenue generated by our 2K Sports products decreased $171million compared to the prior year, mainly reflecting lower sales of our 2008 release Top Spin
3, partially offset by better performance of NBA 2K10 compared to its predecessor title. Net
revenue on current generation platforms accounted for approximately 675% of our total net publishing revenue for the year ended October31, 2009 compared to 823% for the same period in
2008. The decrease is primarily due to the release of Grand Theft Auto IV in April 2008 for the PS3 and Xbox360. PC software sales increased
$379million 921% due primarily to the first quarter 2009 PC release of Grand Theft Auto IV. Sales on prior generation platforms continued to
decline, led by a 482% decrease on PS2, reflecting wider acceptance of current generation platforms. We expect volume on prior generation platforms to continue to decline as a result of the continued
transition to current generation hardware platforms and have therefore reduced the number of titles in development for these older platforms. We have also continued to reduce pricing on software
titles for the PS2 as the current generation hardware installed base grows. 
Gross
profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased for the year ended October31, 2009 as compared to the same period the prior year, which included the initial release period of Grand Theft Auto IV,
one of our highest margin products. Product costs increased as a percentage of net revenue, primarily due to volume based
manufacturing discounts that were recorded in connection with our release of Grand Theft Auto IV in the 2008 period. Additionally, software development
costs and royalties increased as a percentage of net revenue in 2009 as we incurred higher royalty costs associated with the increased number of externally developed titles released in 2009, primarily
related to the October 2009 release of Borderlands. Also, software development costs and royalties were negatively impacted by impairments related to
our Major 
45 
Table of Contents League Baseball titles partially offset by impairments recorded in 2008. Internal royalties decreased from the prior year period primarily due to decreased sales and
profitability in our publishing business and a change in the compensation structure at our Rockstar Games label, where internal royalties were
previously calculated using a net sales formula and are now calculated based on a profit share formula. License costs increased as a percentage of net revenue as we are not expecting to generate the
revenue necessary to exceed the minimum commitments due under our license agreements with Major League Baseball entities. As a result we accelerated the
amortization of certain license costs related to the contract and impaired development costs related to future titles. Additionally, we offered greater price concessions in the 2009 period, primarily
due to the economic slowdown and increased pressure to reduce prices on certain titles. 
Revenue
earned from licensing our intellectual property to third parties and other ancillary revenues decreased to $252million for the year ended October31, 2009 compared to
$332million in 2008, primarily due to the October 2008 release of Grand Theft Auto IV for the PS3 and Xbox360 in Japan. We recognize
substantially higher gross profit margins on revenue earned in connection with licensing our products.

revenue earned outside of North America accounted for approximately $2592million 370% for the year ended October31, 2009 compared to $5347million 435% in the
2008 period. The year-over-year decrease was primarily attributable to the release of Grand Theft Auto IV in the second quarter
of 2008. Foreign exchange rates reduced net revenue and gross profit by approximately $287million and $29million, respectively, for the year ended October31, 2009 compared to
the year ended October31, 2008.

Net revenue decreased $402million for the year ended October31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. The decrease was primarily
attributable to a decrease of $260million in hardware sales, a decrease of $159million in sales for prior generation software due to lower selling prices and declining consumer
spending on titles for the prior generation platforms, and lower PC software sales of $61million. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $108million in sales of Wii
software
as consumers continued to shift their spending to this platform with the increasing popularity of casual gaming. Gross
profit margins decreased in 2009 primarily due to our continued efforts to reduce the number of units on hand in our warehouse by offering our customers reduced pricing on certain prior
generation software and hardware products as well as recording inventory write-downs of approximately $56million in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $37million recorded in the
third quarter of 2008. In addition gross profit margins were negatively impacted by the additional cost of goods sold recognized in conjunction with the third party distribution services agreement
that we entered into in September 2008. Prior to September 2008, we independently operated a distribution warehouse and our product distribution costs were recorded in operating expenses. Partially
offsetting our decreased gross profit margin were software distribution service fees, which we received for acting as an agent on behalf of another publisher. We recorded our distribution fee as
revenue on a net basis. Foreign exchange rates reduced net revenue and gross profit by approximately $28million and $07million, respectively, for the year ended October31,
2009.

Selling
and marketing 
Selling
and marketing expenses decreased $188million for the year ended October31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to: i.a
decrease of $68million in advertising and marketing expense primarily related to the release of Grand Theft Auto
IV in April 2008 with no comparable product in the current year;
ii.a
decrease of $43million in personnel and severance costs due to lower incentive based compensation as well as savings from the restructuring and
termination of employees in our European operations in December 2007, partially offset by a $09million increase in personnel costs in Asia due to expansion initiatives in the
Asia-Pacific region; and
iii.a
decrease of $79million in personnel and warehouse expenses at our distribution facility offset by a $21million increase in management
fees related to the distribution services agreement that we entered into in September 2008. The net savings was further offset by an increase of a $56million distribution fee recorded in cost
of goods sold. General
and administrative 
General
and administrative expenses decreased $363million for the year ended October31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to: i.a
decrease of $209million in professional fees primarily due to a $70million decrease in consulting expense related to stock-based
compensation expense for stock-based awards to ZelnickMedia, reflecting a decrease in the price of our common stock and lower performance-based compensation; consulting and legal fees related to the
Electronic Arts tender offer also decreased by approximately $104million; and
ii.a
decrease of $66million in personnel costs due to lower incentive based compensation and cost saving initiatives initiated in 2008.

Table of Contents
General
and administrative expenses for the year ended October31, 2009 and 2008 also include occupancy expense primarily rent, utilities and office expenses of $141million and
$136million, respectively, related to our development studios. 
Research
and development 
Research
and development expenses decreased slightly for the year ended October31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Personnel costs decreased primarily due to lower bonus expense and
higher capitalization rates. The capitalization rates for payroll related costs for 2008 were lower than usual as certain development studios refocused their efforts to new projects following the
release of Grand Theft Auto IV. This decrease was offset by higher production expenses and increased headcount, primarily
from the prior year acquisitions of Rockstar New England formerly known as Mad Doc SoftwareLLC and 2K Czech formerly known as Illusion Softworks, a.s. as well as expansion initiatives in
Asia-Pacific markets. 
Impairment
of goodwill and long-lived assets 
During
our annual goodwill impairment test we determined that goodwill attributed to our distribution reporting unit was impaired due to a decline in the retail environment in 2009 and its impact on
our outlook for our distribution reporting unit. For the fiscal year ended October31, 2009, we recorded a goodwill and intangible impairment charge of $148million related to our
distribution segment. No impairments were recorded in fiscal 2008. 
Depreciation
and amortization 
For
the year ended October31, 2009, depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $71million compared to 2008 mainly due to lower depreciation and amortization expense associated
with the September 2008 sale of certain assets to a third party as part of entering into a distribution services agreement.

For the year ended October31, 2009, interest and other expense, net decreased $05million due to favorable exchange gains in our foreign
subsidiaries, partially offset by higher interest expense associated with the issuance of the June 2009 Convertible Notes and the line of credit as well as lower interest income in 2009 due to lower
average cash balances and lower interest rates. 
Provision for income taxes.Income tax expense was $45million for the year ended October31, 2009, compared to income tax expense of
$150million for the year ended October31, 2008. The change in income taxes is primarily attributable to pre-tax losses without tax benefit in 2009, a reduction in our
liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits following the conclusion of certain tax audits, and a cumulative charge to increase our valuation allowance as a result of deferred tax liabilities
related to goodwill which cannot be used to offset deferred tax assets, compared to worldwide pre-tax income in 2008 with a related tax charge. We did not record an income tax benefit on our
pre-tax losses in 2009 due to uncertainty regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets, and recorded income tax expense on income generated in several foreign jurisdictions. Our
effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate due to losses without tax benefit in 2009 and changes in gross unrecognized tax benefits during 2008 and 2009. The 2009 
48 
Table of Contents taxable
loss required an increase to the valuation allowance of $248million in 2009, while the use of net operating losses in 2008 enabled the reversal of the valuation allowance of
$193million. 
As
of October31, 2009, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of $246million, all of which would affect our effective tax rate if realized. For the
year ended October31, 2009, gross unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $18million, primarily related to adjustments resulting from tax audits that concluded during 2009. 
U.S.
federal taxing authorities have completed examinations of our income tax returns for years through fiscal 2002. Certain US state taxing authorities are currently examining our income tax returns
from fiscal years 2004 through fiscal 2006. In addition, tax authorities in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions are currently examining our tax returns. It is possible that tax examinations
will be settled prior to October31, 2010. Based on the progress and possible settlement of certain audits, we believe it is reasonably possible that approximately $110million of our
gross unrecognized tax benefits could become payable during the next 12months. We generally are no longer subject to audit for U.S. federal income tax returns for periods prior to fiscal 2003
and state income tax returns for periods prior to 2004. With some exceptions, we are generally no longer subject to income tax examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to
fiscal 2005. 
We
are regularly audited by domestic and foreign taxing authorities. Audits may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes. We believe that our tax
positions comply with applicable tax law, and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments. 
Net loss income and earnings loss per share.For the year ended October31, 2009, our net loss was $1379million, compared to net income of
$971million in the year ended October31, 2008. Net loss per share for the year ended October31, 2009 was $180 compared to net income per share of $129 and $128 for basic
and diluted earnings per share, respectively, for the year ended October31, 2008. Weighted average shares outstanding increased compared to the prior period, mainly due to vesting of
restricted stock awards during fiscal 2009.

The increase in net revenue primarily reflects higher sales of titles from our Grand Theft Auto franchise
predominantly due to our release of Grand Theft Auto IV in the second quarter of 2008. Total net revenue generated from our Grand Theft Auto titles was
$5814million higher in the 2008 period. Our Midnight Club franchise
also contributed $667million to the increase in net revenue in the 2008 period due to the release of Midnight Club: Los Angeles in October
2008. In addition, we have seen continued success of our Carnival Games franchise, which debuted in the fourth quarter of 2007 with Carnival Games for the
Wii and increased net revenue by $533million in 2008 and growth in our family-oriented game market with 
49 
Table of Contents the
release of Dora the Explorer and Go, Diego, Go! titles based on top rated Nickelodeon television
shows which contributed $173million in net revenue in 2008. Furthermore, net revenue generated from our sports business increased by $92million due to our release of Top Spin 3 in 2008,
partially offset by a decrease in revenue due to the performance of our Major League
Baseball franchise. These increases were partially offset by lower revenue earned from our titles The Darkness, The Elder Scrolls
IV, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and Ghost
Rider and which were $1120million higher in the prior period, reflecting sales generated in connection
with their release in the third quarter of 2007. Also, BioShock, which was released on the PS3 in the fourth quarter of 2008 and on the Xbox360
and PC in the fourth quarter of 2007, had lower net revenue of $547million in 2008 compared to 2007. 
Consumer
demand for the PS3, Xbox360 and Wii systems increased in 2008, helping to boost our sales on current generation platforms. Sales on current generation platforms accounted for
approximately 823% of our total net publishing revenue in the 2008 period. PS3 and Xbox360 software sales for 2008 increased from 2007 by $3470million and $2815million,
respectively, primarily due to the success of Grand Theft Auto IV. Wii software sales accounted for $1120million of our net publishing revenue
in 2008, reflecting higher sales of Carnival Games and an increase in the number of titles we released on the Wii such as Major
League Baseball 2K8 and Top Spin 3. Sales on the prior generation
platforms decreased by $963million, mainly reflecting decreased sales of Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories in 2008. We expect sales on the prior generation platforms to continue to decline as a result of the hardware
transition and have therefore reduced the number of titles in development for these platforms. We have reduced pricing on several of our software titles for the prior generation platforms as the
current generation hardware installed base grows. Handheld sales increased by $133million, primarily due to the release of Midnight Club: LA
Remix on the PSP and sales of our Nickelodeon titles Dora the Explorer and Go, Diego,
Go! and Carnival Games that released on the DS. PC sales decreased by $525million, primarily due to decreased sales of BioShock and The Elder Scrolls IV: The Shivering Isles, which were released in 2007. Gross
profit as a percentage of net revenue increased significantly due to the release of Grand Theft Auto IV in 2008, as this title was internally
developed and the intellectual property is wholly-owned. Product costs decreased as a percentage of net revenue, primarily due to the volume based manufacturing discounts we received related to the
release of Grand Theft Auto IV. Internal royalties increased as a percentage of net revenue, again reflecting increased sales of our Grand Theft Auto
titles. 
Excluding
the impact of Grand Theft Auto IV, product costs as a percentage of net revenue decreased slightly, mainly due to the 2007 period which
included a $52million impairment charge related to intellectual property. Software development costs and royalties decreased in 2008 as a percentage of net revenue, mainly due to a larger
share of revenues generated from internally developed titles. Internal royalty costs as percentage of net revenues remained relatively consistent with the prior year. License costs increased slightly
as a percentage of net revenue due to both higher royalty expense and lower revenue generated from our Major League Baseball license, partially offset
by lower licensing rates in connection with other 2008 titles, including Don King Presents: Prizefighter and Top Spin
3. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, excluding the impact of Grand Theft Auto IV, increased by 23% in the 2008
period, mainly due to a higher proportion of internally developed titles including Bully: Scholarship Edition, Midnight Club:
Los Angeles, Sid Meier Civilization Revolution, and Top Spin
3 and the continued success of Carnival Games. In addition, in 2008 our NBA 2K9
title had higher gross margins than its predecessor game due to higher revenues on a comparable amount of software development costs. 
Revenue
earned from licensing our intellectual property to third parties increased to $332million in 2008 from $308million in 2007, primarily due to our October 2008 release of Grand Theft Auto IV
for the PS3 and Xbox360 in Japan, which was partially offset by the July 2007 release of Grand Theft
Auto: Liberty City Stories for the PS2 and PSP in Japan. We recognize higher gross profit margins on revenue earned in connection with licensing our products. 
50 
Table of Contents
Revenue
earned outside of North America accounted for approximately 435% of our net revenue in 2008 compared to 347% in 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to our simultaneous global
release of Grand Theft Auto IV and Midnight Club: Los Angeles for the PS3 and Xbox360. Foreign
exchange rates increased revenue by approximately $204million in 2008.

Net revenue associated with software for current generation platforms increased $295million and hardware sales increased $168million,
reflecting increased availability of current generation platforms, especially the Wii. In addition, PC software sales increased $68million. Offsetting the 2008 increases were lower sales of
prior generation software of $191million, reflecting a shift in consumer demand for newer software. We experienced a decline in software sales for Nintendo handheld devices and peripherals of
$159million. 
In
September 2008, we agreed to outsource the pick, pack, ship and warehousing functions for our publishing and distribution businesses. In addition, we sold certain assets of our distribution
business, including warehouse management, processing and value-added service operations of our distribution facility. 
Foreign
currency exchange rates increased net revenue by approximately $58million in 2008, as a result of a stronger Canadian dollar throughout most of 2008 and an increased proportion of
international sales. The decrease in gross margin mainly related to a $37million write-down of inventory in 2008 in conjunction with our plan to reduce the number of titles that
we manage and distribute in order to focus on higher gross margin products and improve the distribution businesses' operating efficiency. Excluding the write-down of inventory, the gross
margin would have increased to 100% in 2008, primarily due to increased bundling of software with hardware.

and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue in 2008, reflecting the revenue contribution of Grand Theft Auto IV. However

increase in advertising expense of $227million, mainly related to the releases of Grand Theft Auto
IV and Midnight Club: Los Angeles;
ii.a
$90million increase in personnel costs, mainly resulting from higher incentive compensation expense that was based on overall company

reorganization and related costs 
In
2007 we announced a business reorganization plan to renew and optimize our management and organizational structure. Accordingly, we incurred business reorganization and related expenses of
$175million in 2007 consisting of employee termination costs of $101million, $29million of facility related and relocation costs to move our 2K headquarters to California,
and $44million in professional fees and other costs related to the replacement of prior management and the election of five new directors to our Board of Directors at our annual stockholders'
meeting. In 2008 we substantially completed our business reorganization and incurred costs of $45million consisting mainly of further employee termination, facility related and relocation
costs in connection with the closure of two studios. As a result, we do not expect to incur material reorganization charges related to this plan in 2009.

In 2007, we sold substantially all of the assets, primarily inventory and accounts receivable, of our wholly-owned Joytech video game accessories subsidiary,
formerly a component of our publishing business, to Mad Catz Interactive,Inc. for approximately $36million in cash and notes receivable, resulting in a recognized loss on the sale of
$31million. The disposition of Joytech did not involve a significant amount of assets or materially impact our operating results. Also,
in 2007, we recognized a loss of $14million when we deconsolidated the net assets of Blue Castle Games,Inc. Blue Castle, which was previously accounted for, in accordance
with the Variable Interest Entity guidance, as a wholly-owned subsidiary and considered to be a variable interest entity. We are no longer considered to be the primary beneficiary of Blue Castle
profits or losses. 
In
2008, we incurred a foreign exchange transaction loss of $51million for the year ended October31, 2008, reflecting a strengthening United States dollar in the fourth quarter of
2008, compared to a foreign exchange transaction gain of $16million for the year ended October31, 2007.  Provision for income taxes.Income tax expense was $150million for the year ended October31, 2008, as compared to $102million for the
year ended October31, 2007. Our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates and the application of net operating losses carried
forward to 2008 taxable income. The use of the net operating losses enabled the reversal of valuation allowances of $193million in 2008, while the 2007 taxable loss required an increase to
the valuation allowance of $406million. 
We
are regularly audited by domestic and foreign taxing authorities. Audits may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes. We believe that our tax
positions comply with applicable tax law, and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments. 
Net income loss and earnings loss per share.For the year ended October31, 2008, net income was $971million, compared to a net loss of
$1384million for the year ended October31, 2007. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended October31, 2008 was $129 and $128, respectively, compared to a loss
per share of $193 for the year ended October31, 2007. Weighted average shares outstanding increased compared to the prior period, mainly due to an increase in the exercise of stock options as
a result of a higher average stock price in the 2008 period and the issuance of 1,496,647 shares of restricted stock in connection with our acquisition of 2K Czech, formerly known as Illusion
Softworks. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Our primary cash requirements have been to fund ithe development, manufacturing and marketing of our published products,
iiworking capital, iiiacquisitions and ivcapital expenditures. We expect to rely on funds provided by our operating activities, our credit agreement and our recently
issued Convertible Notes to satisfy our working capital needs. 
In
June 2009, we issued $1380million aggregate principal amount of 4375% convertible senior notes due 2014 Convertible Notes. The issuance of the Convertible Notes included
$180million related to the exercise of an over-allotment option by the underwriters. Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable 
53 
Table of Contents semi-annually
on June1 and December1 of each year, commencing on December1, 2009. The Convertible Notes mature on June1, 2014, unless earlier redeemed or
repurchased by the Company or converted. 
The
Convertible Notes are convertible at an initial conversion rate of 936768 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes representing an initial conversion price of
approximately $10675 per share of common stock for a total of approximately 12,927,000 underlying conversion shares subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Holders may convert the
Convertible Notes at their option prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding
December1, 2013 only under the following circumstances: 1during any fiscal quarter commencing after July31, 2009, if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at
least 20 trading days whether or not consecutive during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the
applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day; 2during the five business day period after any 10 consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the trading
price per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes for each day of that measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the applicable
conversion rate on each such day; 3if we call the Convertible Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the third scheduled trading day prior to the redemption
date; or 4upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On and after December1, 2013 until the close of business on the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding the
maturity date, holders may convert their Convertible Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, the Convertible Notes may be settled, at our election, in cash,
shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of the Company common stock.

any time on or after June5, 2012, the Company may redeem all of the outstanding Convertible Notes for cash, but only if the last reported sale of our common stock for 20 or more trading
days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date we provide notice of redemption to holders of the Convertible Notes exceeds 150% of the conversion price in
effect on each such trading day. The redemption price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus all accrued and unpaid interest including additional
interest, if any to, but excluding, the redemption date. The indenture governing the Convertible Notes contains customary terms and covenants and events of default. As of October31, 2009, we
were in compliance with all covenants and requirements outlined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes. 
In
connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions, which are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion
of the Convertible Notes. The convertible note hedge transactions allow the Company to receive shares of its common stock related to the excess conversion value that it would convey to the holders of
the Convertible Notes upon conversion. The transactions include options to purchase approximately 12,927,000 shares of common stock at $10675 per share, expiring on June1, 2014, for a total
cost of approximately $436million, which decreased additional paid-in capital. 
Separately,
the Company entered into a warrant transaction with a strike price of $14945. The warrants will be net share settled and will cover approximately 12,927,000 shares of the Company common
stock and expire on August30, 2014, for total proceeds of approximately $263million, which was recorded to additional paid-in capital. 
In
July 2007, we entered into a credit agreement which provides for borrowings of up to $1400million and is secured by substantially all of our assets and the equity of our subsidiaries the
Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement expires on July3, 2012. Revolving loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at our election of a200% to 250% above a certain base
rate with a minimum 600% base rate 800% at October31, 2009 and October31, 2008, or b325% to 375% above the LIBOR Rate with a minimum 
54 
Table of Contents 400%
LIBOR Rate 725% at October31, 2009 and October31, 2008. We are also required to pay a monthly fee on the unused available balance, ranging from 025% to 075% based on amounts
borrowed. 
Availability
under the Credit Agreement is restricted by our domestic and United Kingdom based accounts receivable and inventory balances. The Credit Agreement also allows for the issuance of letters
of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $250million. 
On
May28, 2009, we paid down all of the outstanding borrowings on our Credit Agreement. As of October31, 2009 there were no outstanding borrowings and $881million was
available for borrowings. We had $116million of letters of credit outstanding at October31, 2009 and were in compliance with all covenants and requirements in the Credit Agreement. 
The
Credit Agreement substantially limits us and our subsidiaries' ability to: create, incur, assume or be liable for indebtedness; dispose of assets outside the ordinary course of business; acquire,
merge or consolidate with or into another person or entity; create, incur or allow any lien on any of their respective properties; make investments; or pay dividends or make distributions each
subject to certain limitations. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for certain events of default such as nonpayment of principal and interest, breaches of representations and warranties,
noncompliance with covenants, acts of insolvency, default on indebtedness held by third parties and default on certain material contracts subject to certain limitations and cure periods. The Credit
Agreement also contains a requirement that we maintain an interest coverage ratio of more than one to one for the trailing twelve month period, if the liquidity of our domestic operations falls below
$300million including available borrowings under the credit facility, based on a 30-day average. As of October31, 2009, we were in compliance with all covenants and
requirements outlined in the Credit Agreement. 
We
are subject to credit risks, particularly if any of our receivables represent a limited number of customers or are concentrated in foreign markets. If we are unable to collect our accounts
receivable as they become due, it could adversely affect our liquidity and working capital position. 
Generally,
we have been able to collect our accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business. We do not hold any collateral to secure payment from customers. We have trade credit insurance on
the majority of our customers to mitigate accounts receivable risk. 
A
majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to major retailers and distributors. Our five largest customers accounted for 480% and 402% of net revenue for the years ended
October31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of October31, 2009 and 2008, amounts due from our five largest customers comprised approximately 565% and 390% of our gross accounts
receivable balance, respectively, with our significant customers those that individually comprised more than 10% of our gross accounts receivable balance accounting for 479% and 118% of such
balance at October31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk based on past collection
experience, although we actively monitor each customer credit worthiness and economic conditions that may impact our customers' business and access to capital. We are monitoring the current global
economic conditions, including credit markets and other factors as it relates to our customers in order to manage the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable. 
We
have entered into various agreements in the ordinary course of business that require substantial cash commitments over the next several years. Generally, these include: Agreements to acquire licenses to intellectual property such as trademarks, copyrights and technology for use in the
publishing, marketing and distribution of our software titles. Our licensing and marketing commitments primarily reflect agreements with major sports leagues and players' associations and expire at
various times through September 2014;  
Contractual payments to third party software developers that expire at various times through June 2011. Guaranteed minimum
payments assume satisfactory performance; 
55 
Table of Contents Operating leases, primarily related to occupancy, furniture and equipment, expiring at various times through January 2017;
and  
A distribution services agreement to outsource non-core elements shipping, receiving, warehouse management
and related functions of our publishing and distribution business through September 2013. A
summary of annual minimum contractual obligations and commitments as of October31, 2009 is as follows in thousands of dollars:

In
addition to the cash commitments above, we have also entered into acquisition agreements that contain provisions for us to pay contingent cash consideration, typically contingent on the acquired
company achieving certain financial, unit sales, or performance conditions. The amount and timing of these payments are currently not fixed or determinable. See Note4 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for a full discussion of our potential acquisition commitments. 
Income Taxes.At October31, 2009, the Company had recorded a liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits of $209million for which we believe it
is reasonably possible that approximately $110million could become payable during the next 12months. These liabilities have not been included in the contractual obligations table. See
Note12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
We
believe our current cash and cash equivalents and projected cash flow from operations, along with availability under our Credit Agreement will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our
cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and commitments through at least the next 12months. 
Our
cash and cash equivalents decreased by $1782million for the year ended October31, 2009 as follows:

At
October31, 2009 we had $1021million of cash and cash equivalents, compared to $2803million at October31, 2008. Our decrease in cash and cash equivalents from
October31, 2008 was primarily a result of cash used for operating activities, as we incurred a net loss of $1379million for the year ended October31, 2009 compared to net
income of $971million for the year ended October31, 2008. Also contributing to our net cash used for operating activities were payments for software development costs 
56 
Table of Contents and
licenses, primarily consisting of payroll, payments to developers and sports licenses and an increase in accounts receivable primarily reflecting numerous releases in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Cash used in operating activities was slightly offset by an increase in accounts payable and accruals. 
The
use of cash for investing activities did not significantly change for the year ended October31, 2009 compared to the prior period. Cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2009 was
$170million mainly due to the purchase of computer equipment and software and earnout payments made for prior year acquisitions. 
Cash
provided by financing activities in 2009 was mainly a result of proceeds received from the issuance of $1380million of Convertible Notes, offset by the pay down of $700million
of outstanding borrowings on our line of credit. In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes we paid $50million of debt issuance costs, purchased $436million of
convertible note hedges to offset the dilution of converted shares and sold $263million of warrants to offset the cost of the note hedge. Also, the lower price of our common stock compared to
the prior year resulted in lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
Cash
and cash equivalents were positively impacted by $32million in 2009 as a result of foreign currency exchange movements. 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
As of October31, 2009 and 2008, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties, such as entities often
referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually
narrow or limited purposes. As such, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements and are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had
engaged in such relationships. 
International Operations 
Net revenue earned outside of the United States is principally generated by our operations in Europe, Canada, Australia, and Asia. For 2009 and 2008,
approximately 325% and 407%, respectively, of our net revenue was earned outside of the United States. We are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade, including increased credit risks, tariffs
and duties, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, shipping delays and international political, regulatory and economic developments, all of which can have a significant impact on our
operating results. 
Fluctuations in Quarterly Operating Results and Seasonality 
We have experienced fluctuations in quarterly operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles; variations in sales of
titles developed for particular platforms; market acceptance of our titles; development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles; sequels or enhancements of existing titles;
projected and actual changes in platforms; the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors; product returns; changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors; the accuracy of
retailers' forecasts of consumer demand; the size and timing of acquisitions; the timing of orders from major customers; and order cancellations and delays in product shipment. Sales of our titles are
also seasonal, with peak shipments typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter our fourth and first fiscal quarters as a result of increased demand for titles during the holiday season.
Quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.

Item7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    
Interest Rate Risk 
Historically, fluctuations in interest rates have not had a significant impact on our operating results. Under our Credit Agreement, outstanding
balances bear interest at our election of a200% to 250% above a certain base rate with a minimum 600% base rate 800% at October31, 2009, or b325% to 375% above the
LIBOR rate with a minimum 400% LIBOR Rate 725% at October31, 2009, with the margin rate subject to the achievement of certain average liquidity levels. Changes in market rates may impact
our future interest expense if there is an outstanding balance on our line of credit. The Convertible Notes pay interest semi-annually at a fixed rate of 4375% per annum and we expect
that there will be no fluctuation related to the Convertible Notes impacting our current year interest expense. In addition, we amortize debt issuance costs to interest expense. Upon adoption of the
new accounting guidance for convertible debt arrangements requiring separate accounting for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments, we will reclassify a portion of our
debt balance to additional paid-in-capital, representing a bifurcation based on the fair value of the embedded conversion option in the Convertible Notes. The difference
between the principal amount of the Convertible Notes and the remaining liability component after the bifurcation will be reported as a debt discount. We will be required to amortize the debt discount
using the interest method, as non-cash interest expense on our statement of operations in addition to the coupon interest on the Convertible Notes. Upon adoption of this guidance on November1,
2009 we will reclassify $436million of our Convertible Notes to additional paid-in-capital, representing a bifurcation based on the fair value of the Convertible
Notes' embedded conversion option. As of November1, 2009 we have begun amortizing the debt discount as non-cash interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations in addition to the
Convertible Notes' coupon interest payments. For additional details of our Convertible Notes see Note9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
We transact business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Accounts relating
to foreign operations are translated into United States dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant quarter end. Translation adjustments are included as a separate component of
stockholders' equity. For the year ended October31, 2009, our foreign currency translation gain adjustment was approximately $157million. We recognized a foreign exchange transaction
gain in interest and other expense, net in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended October31, 2009 of $37million and a foreign exchange transaction loss for the
year ended October31, 2008 of $51million. 
We
use forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk related to foreign currency transactions. These transactions primarily relate to non-functional currency
denominated inter-company funding loans, non-functional currency denominated accounts receivable and non-functional currency denominated accounts payable. We do not enter into
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. At October31, 2009, we had forward contracts outstanding to purchase $304million of foreign currency in exchange for U.S.
dollars with a 30day maturity to November30, 2009 and recorded a $01million foreign currency transaction loss related to these contracts in interest and other expense, net. 
For
the year ended October31, 2009, 325% of the Company revenue was generated outside the United States. Using sensitivity analysis, a hypothetical 10% increase in the value of the U.S.
dollar against all currencies would decrease revenues by 32%, while a hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies would increase revenues by 32%. In the opinion
of management, a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by cost of goods sold and operating expenses incurred in local currency. As a result, a hypothetical 10% movement of the value
of the U.S. dollar against all currencies in either direction would impact the Company gross margin by 06%.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management, our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
Exchange Act
were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
irecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and iiaccumulated and communicated to our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls 
Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that: ipertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
iiprovide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and
iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a
material effect on our financial statements. Management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods is subject
to the risk that those
internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule13a-15f under the Exchange Act. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October31, 2009. Our independent registered public accounting firm, EY, has issued an attestation report on our internal control
over financial reporting. The report on the audit of internal control over financial reporting appears on page 68 of this Form10-K.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during 2009, which were identified in connection with management evaluation
required by paragraphd of Rules13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.
