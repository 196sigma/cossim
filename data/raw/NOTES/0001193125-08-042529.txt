Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15f or 15d-15f promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by,
or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. Management has designed its internal control over financial reporting to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Managements assessment
included review and testing of both the design effectiveness and operating effectiveness of controls over all relevant assertions related to all significant accounts and disclosures in the financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our principal executive officers and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, our management has concluded that
our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2007. BDO Seidman, LLP, the independent registered
public accounting firm, which audited the financial statements included in the annual report, has also issued an attestation on our internal control over financial reporting, and their report is set forth on page 31.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Shareholders Dril-Quip, Inc. Houston, Texas We have audited Dril-Quip, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Dril-Quip, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A.Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted
our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Dril-Quip, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based
on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Dril-Quip, Inc. as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

DRIL-QUIP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.Organization Dril-Quip, Inc., a Delaware
corporation the Company or Dril-Quip, designs, manufactures, sells and services highly engineered offshore drilling and production equipment that is well suited for use in deepwater, harsh environment and severe service
applications. The Companys principal products consist of subsea and surface wellheads, subsea and surface production trees, subsea control systems and manifolds, mudline hanger systems, specialty connectors and associated pipe, drilling and
production riser systems, liner hangers, wellhead connectors and diverters. Dril-Quips products are used by major integrated, large independent and foreign national oil and gas companies in offshore areas throughout the world. Dril-Quip also
provides installation and reconditioning services and rents running tools for use in connection with the installation and retrieval of its products. The Companys operations are organized into three geographic segmentsWestern Hemisphere including North and South America; headquartered in Houston, Texas, Eastern Hemisphere including Europe and Africa;
headquartered in Aberdeen, Scotland and Asia-Pacific including the Pacific Rim, Southeast Asia, Australia, India and the Middle East; headquartered in Singapore. Each of these segments sells similar products and services and the Company has major
manufacturing facilities in all three of its headquarter locations. The Companys major subsidiaries are Dril-Quip Europe Limited DQE, located in Aberdeen with branches in Denmark, Norway and Holland; Dril-Quip Asia Pacific PTE Ltd. DQAP,
located in Singapore; and Dril-Quip do Brasil LTDA DQB, located in Macae, Brazil. Dril-Quip Nigeria Ltd. is located in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, and Dril-Quip Egypt for Petroleum Services S.A.E. is located in Alexandria, Egypt. Both are wholly
owned subsidiaries of DQE. 2. Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of the Companys more significant estimates are those affected by critical accounting policies for revenue recognition, inventories and
contingent liabilities. Cash and cash equivalents Short-term investments that have a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company invests excess cash in mutual funds rated as the highest quality by
nationally recognized rating agencies. The funds primarily invest in short-term money market instruments that blend top-tier, high quality U.S. dollar denominated obligations, which include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, master and
promissory notes, municipal securities and repurchase agreements. The Companys investment objectives include the provision of a high level of current income consistent with the preservation of capital and the maintenance of liquidity.

Trade Receivables The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts on trade receivables equal to amounts estimated to be uncollectible. This estimate is based upon historical collection experience combined with a specific
review of each customers outstanding trade receivable balance. Management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate, however, actual write-offs may exceed the recorded allowance. The following is a summary of activity
relating to the allowance for doubtful accounts for the years ended December31, 2005, 2006 and 2007:  Inthousands Balance at December31, 2004 2,735 Charges to costs and expenses 890 Recoveries 1,752 Balance at December31, 2005 1,873 Charges to costs and expenses 1,306 Recoveries 507 Balance at December31, 2006 2,672 Charges to costs and expenses 978 Recoveries 1,338 Balance at December31, 2007 2,312 Inventories Inventory costs are determined principally by the use of the first-in, first-out FIFO costing method, and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory is valued principally using standard costs, which are
calculated based upon direct costs incurred and overhead allocations. Periodically, obsolescence reviews are performed on slow-moving inventories and reserves are established based on current assessments about future demands and market conditions.
The inventory values have been reduced by a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories. Inventory reserves of $169 million and $192 million were recorded as of December31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. If market conditions are less favorable
than those projected by management, additional inventory reserves may be required. Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost, with depreciation provided on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets including property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of an asset
exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, an impairment charge is recognized. No impairment of long-lived assets existed at December31, 2006 or 2007. Income Taxes The Company accounts
for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Current income taxes are provided on income reported for financial statement purposes, adjusted for transactions that do not enter into the computation of income taxes payable in the same year.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.

Revenue Recognition For the majority of the Companys sales, revenue is recorded at the time the manufacturing process is complete and the products have been shipped to the consumer. For these sales, ownership is transferred to the
customer at the time of shipment. Service revenues are recorded at the time the service is rendered. The Company uses the percentage-of-completion method on long-term project contracts. Long-term project contracts have the following characteristics:
The contracts call for products which are designed to customer specifications;  The structural design is unique and requires significant engineering and manufacturing efforts generally requiring more than one year in duration;
The contracts contain specific terms as to milestones, progress billings and delivery dates;  Product requirement cannot be filled directly from the Companys standard inventory. For each project, the Company prepares a detailed analysis of estimated costs, profit margin, completion date and risk factors which include availability
of material, production efficiencies and other factors that may impact the project. On a quarterly basis, management reviews the progress of each contract, which may result in revisions of previous estimates, including revenue recognition.
Historically, the Companys estimates of total costs and costs to complete have approximated actual costs incurred to complete the project. However, there are many factors that may impact future estimates as discussed under Item 1A. Risk
Factors. Under the percentage-of-completion method revenue is recognized based on the percentage of costs incurred to date compared
to total cost to complete. Losses, if any, are recorded in full in the period they become evident. Under the percentage-of-completion
method, billings do not always correlate directly to the revenue recognized. Based upon the terms of the specific contract, billings may be in excess of the revenue recognized, in which case the amounts are included in customer prepayments as a
liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Likewise, revenue recognized may exceed customer billings in which case the amounts are reported in trade receivables. Unbilled revenues are expected to be billed and collected within the following year.
At December31, 2007 and 2006, trade receivables included $18,129,000 and $12,925,000 of unbilled receivables, respectively. During 2007, 16 projects representing approximately 19% of the Companys revenue were accounted for using
percentage-of-completion accounting. Foreign Currency The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at period end exchange rates except for revenues and expenses, which are translated at average monthly rates. Translation adjustments
are reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity and have no current effect on earnings or cash flows. These adjustments amounted to a loss of $7,170,000, a gain of $11,418,000 and a gain of $3,304,000 in 2005, 2006 and 2007,
respectively. Foreign currency exchange transactions are recorded using the exchange rate at the date of the settlement. Exchange gains
losses were approximately $527,000 in 2005, $1,531,000 in 2006, and $2,184,000 in 2007, net of income taxes. These amounts are included in selling, general and administrative costs in the consolidated statements of income. Stock-Based Compensation Effective
January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No123 Revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method and accordingly, no prior periods have been restated. The Company
is recognizing compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards outstanding at January1, 2006 ratably over the remaining vesting period based on the fair value at the date of the grant. The fair value of the options was estimated using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
39 Table of Contents
Prior to adopting SFAS 123R, the Company accounted for stock-based employee compensation arrangements
in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB No25 and complied with the disclosure provisions of SFAS No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under APB No25, compensation expense was based on the difference, if any, on the date of the grant, between the fair value of the Companys common stock and the exercise price of the
option. No stock-based employee compensation cost was recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements for the years ended December31, 2005, as all options previously granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of
the underlying common stock on the date of the grant. Had compensation cost for the Companys stock-based compensation plans been
determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards consistent with the method available under SFAS No123, the Companys net income and earnings per share for the years ended December31, 2005 would have been reduced to
the pro forma amounts listed below:  Year endedDecember31,2005 Inthousands Net Income As reported 32,567 Less: Compensation expense per SFAS No123, net of tax 1,523 Pro forma net income 31,044 Earnings per share As reported Basic 092 Diluted 090 Pro forma Basic 088 Diluted 086 As a result of adopting SFAS 123R, stock-based compensation expense recognized as selling,
general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of income during the years ended December31, 2006 and 2007 totaled $18 million and $23 million, respectively. No stock-based compensation was capitalized during
those years. While the options granted to employees vest over four years, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight line
basis over the vesting period of the options. At December31, 2007, there was $103 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock option awards. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average
of 22 years. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables, and debt instruments. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their respective
fair values as they are either short-term in nature or carry interest rates that approximate market rates. Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include primarily trade receivables. The Company
grants credit to its customers, which operate primarily in the oil and gas industry. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not 
40 Table of Contents
require collateral. The Company maintains reserves for potential losses, and such losses have historically been within managements expectations.
In addition, the Company invests excess cash in mutual funds. These money market funds, rated as the highest quality by nationally
recognized rating agencies, are not insured or guaranteed by any governmental agency. Changes in the financial markets, including changes in interest rates, as well as changes in the performance of the issuers could affect the market value of our
short-term investments. Comprehensive Income SFAS No130 Reporting Comprehensive Income. establishes the rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components. SFAS No130 requires the Company to include
unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency translation adjustments in comprehensive income. Generally, gains are attributed to a weakening U.S. dollar and losses are the result of a strengthening U.S. dollar. Interest Capitalization The Company
capitalizes interest on significant construction projects for which interest costs are being incurred. These projects principally consist of construction or expansion of the Companys facilities. No interest was capitalized in 2005, 2006 or
2007. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed considering the dilutive effect of stock options using
the treasury stock method. New Accounting Standards In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 revised 2007, Business Combinations SFAS 141R. SFAS 141R replaces Statement No. 141, Business Combinations. The statement retains the
purchase method of accounting used in business combinations but replaces SFAS 141 by establishing principles and requirements for the recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities and goodwill including the requirement that most transaction
costs and restructuring costs be expensed. In addition, the statement requires disclosures to enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R is effective for business combinations for which the
acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We will adopt SFAS 141R on January 1, 2009 for acquisitions on or after this date. In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB 160, Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment to ARB No51
SFAS No160, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. The provision of SFAS No160 are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December15, 2008. The Company does not believe the provisions of this statement will materially effect the results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 SFAS 159. SFAS 159 permits
entities to choose to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and loses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS is effective for years beginning after
November 15, 2007. We adopted SFAS 159 on January 1, 2008 and did not elect to apply the fair value method to any eligible assets or liabilities at that time. 
41 Table of Contents
The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement 109 FIN 48, on January1, 2007. FIN 48 was issued in June 2006 and prescribes that the Company recognize in its financial statements the impact of a tax position that is
more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any appeals. The interpretation provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure and transition. Based on our evaluation, we have concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax
positions requiring recognition in our financial statements. Our evaluation was performed for the tax years which remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions as of December 31, 2007, which are the years ended December31, 2001
through 2007. The Company has occasionally been assessed interest or penalties by major tax jurisdictions and these assessments
historically have been minimal and immaterial to our financial results. In accordance with our accounting policy, both before and after adoption of FIN 48, interest expense assessed by tax jurisdictions is included with interest expense and assessed
penalties are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements or SFAS 157, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures under fair value
measurements. SFAS 157 applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. However, on February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-2
which would delay the effective date of SFAS 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually. This FSP
partially defers the effective date of Statement 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this FSP. Effective for 2008, we will adopt SFAS 157 except as it
applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in FSP FAS 157-2. We are currently evaluating the potential impact on our financial statements, if any, upon adoption of this standard. 3. Inventories Inventories consist of the following:

credit of up to $10 million. At the option of the Company, borrowing under this facility bears interest at either a rate equal to LIBOR London Interbank Offered Rate plus 175% or the Guaranty Bank base rate. The facility calls for quarterly
interest payments and terminates June1, 2009. The facility also contains certain covenants including maintaining minimum tangible net worth levels, not exceeding specified funded debt amounts and required interest coverage ratios. As of
December31, 2006 and 2007, the Company had no borrowings under this facility and was in compliance with all loan covenants. Dril-Quip Europe Limited has a credit agreement with the Bank of Scotland dated March21, 2001 in the original amount of U.K. Pounds Sterling 40million approximately U.S. $8 million. Borrowing under this facility bears
interest at the Bank of Scotland base rate, which was 55% at December31, 2007, plus 1%, and is repayable in 120 equal monthly installments, plus interest. Substantially all of this facility was used to finance capital expenditures in Norway.
The outstanding balance of this facility at December31, 2006 and 2007 was approximately U.S.$34million and U.S.$27, respectively. The facility is secured by land and buildings in Aberdeen, Scotland and contains no
restrictive financial covenants. Interest paid on long-term debt for the years ended December31, 2005, 2006 and 2007 was $966,000 749,000 and $253,000 respectively. Scheduled maturities of long-term debt are as follows: 2008$857,000; 2009$856,000; 2010$858,000; 2011$309,000; 2012$31,000; and thereafter$0.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Based upon existing market conditions and the Companys earnings prospects, it is anticipated that all deferred tax benefits will be
realized in future years. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:  December31 2006 2007 In thousands Deferred tax assets Deferred profit on intercompany sales 6,733 5,023 Inventory 2,946 2,676 Inventory reserve 2,521 4,039 Allowance for doubtful accounts 568 418 Reserve for accrued liabilities 1,026 684 Other 1,630 3,463 Total deferred tax assets 15,424 16,303 Deferred tax liability Property, plant and equipment 6,757 6,867 Net deferred tax asset 8,667 9,436 Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are considered to be
indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal income taxes has been provided thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to both U.S. income taxes subject
to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practicable. The Companys income tax returns are subject to review and examination by the Internal Revenue Service IRS and in October 2007, the
IRS scheduled an examination of the 2005 Tax Return. We believe the return is materially correct as filed and we do not expect that the examination will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, financial
position or cash flows. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provides for a tax deduction for qualified production activities. Under the
guidance of FASB Staff Position No 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the deduction will
be treated as a special deduction as described in SFAS No109 and not as a reduction in the tax rate. As such, the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing on the date of enactment. The
Companys production activities qualify for the tax deduction and the Companys 2007 tax provision includes an estimated deduction of approximately $13 million. The Company paid $11,438,000, $15,167,000 and $41,840,000 in income taxes in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively.

Accrued vendor costs 1,510 2,319
Other 1,515 3,524 Total 13,326 14,639 8. Employee Benefit Plans The Company has a defined-contribution 401k plan covering domestic employees and a defined-contribution pension plan covering certain foreign employees. The Company generally makes contributions to the plans equal
to each participants eligible contributions for the plan year up to a specified percentage of the participants annual compensation. The Companys contribution expense was $1,147,000, $1,520,000 and $2,656,000 in 2005, 2006 and 2007,
respectively. 9. Commitments and Contingencies The Company leases certain office, shop and warehouse facilities, automobiles, and equipment. The Company expenses all lease payments when incurred. Total lease expense incurred was $2,340,000, $3,023,000 and $2,676,000 in 2005, 2006 and
2007, respectively. Future annual minimum lease commitments, including required leasehold improvements, at December31, 2007 are as follows: 2008$1,242,000; 2009$558,000; 2010$329,000; 2011$18,804,000;
2012$2,878,000; and thereafter$2,165,000. In August 2007, our Brazilian subsidiary was served with assessments collectively
valued at approximately $128 million from the State of Rio de Janiero, Brazil, to collect a state tax on the importation of goods. We believe that our subsidiary is not liable for the taxes and plan to vigorously contest the assessments in the
Brazilian administrative and judicial systems. At this time, the ultimate disposition of this matter cannot presently be determined and therefore, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount of loss or the range of possible losses that
might result from an adverse judgment or settlement of these assessments. Accordingly, no liability has been accrued in conjunction with this matter. We do not expect the liability, if any, resulting from these assessments to have a material adverse
effect on the Companys operations, financial position or cash flows. In November 2007, the Company entered into a lease agreement in
Singapore for approximately 11 acres of vacant land. The lease term is 30 years and the Company elected to make a lump sum payment for the entire lease. In addition, under the terms of the lease, the Company is obligated to make certain minimum
investments in machinery, leasehold improvements and buildings within the next five years. The Company operates its business and markets
its products and services in most of the significant oil and gas producing areas in the world and is, therefore, subject to the risk customarily attendant to international operations and dependency on the condition of the oil and gas industry.
Additionally, products of the Company are used in potentially hazardous drilling, completion, and production applications that can cause personal injury, product liability, and environmental claims. Although exposure to such risk has not resulted in
any significant problems in the past, there can be no assurance that future developments will not adversely impact the Company. 
46 Table of Contents
The Company is also involved in a number of legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.
Although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of such legal action, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability with respect thereto will not have a material adverse affect on the Companys operations,
financial position or cash flows. 10. Stockholders Equity The Rights Agreement between the Company and ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C. dated as of October17, 1997 the Rights Plan included one Right to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for each share of common stock. On October17, 2007, the Rights Agreement and the rights issued thereunder expired by their terms. No shares of the Series A Preferred Stock were issued or
outstanding. 11.

East; headquartered in Singapore. Each of these segments sells similar products and services and the Company has major manufacturing facilities in all three of its headquarter locations. Eliminations of operating profits are related to intercompany inventory transfers that are deferred until shipment is made to third party customers.
In 2007, 2006 and 2005, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys revenues. 12. Employee Stock Option Plan and Awards On
September19, 1997, the Company adopted the Dril-Quip, Inc. 1997 Incentive Plan as amended, the 1997 Plan and the Company reserved 3,400,000 shares of Common Stock for use in connection with the 1997 Plan. During 2001, the Company
reserved an additional 1,400,000 shares for use in connection with the 1997 Plan. Some options remain outstanding under the 1997 Plan, however no additional grants will be awarded under this plan. On May13, 2004, the Companys
stockholders approved the 2004 Incentive Plan of Dril-Quip, Inc. the 2004 Plan, which reserved up to 2,696,294 shares of Common Stock to be used in connection with the 2004 Plan. Persons eligible for awards under the 1997 Plan and 2004
Plan are employees holding positions of responsibility with the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Options granted under the 1997 Plan and the 2004 Plan have a term of ten years and become exercisable in cumulative annual increments of one-fourth
of the total number of shares of Common Stock subject thereto, beginning on the first anniversary of the date of the grant. The fair value
of stock options granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected life was based on the Companys historical trends and volatility was based on the Companys common stock historical
volatility. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yield curve at the grant date. The Company does not pay dividends and therefore there is no dividend yield. There were no options granted in 2005. 
48 Table of Contents
On October27, 2006 and October26, 2007 the Company granted options to purchase 264,435 and
256,284 shares, respectively, of common stock pursuant to the 2004 Plan to certain officers and employees.

Common Stock In September 2006, the board of directors of the Company approved a two-for-one common stock split in the form of a stock dividend. As a result, the split was paid in the form of a stock dividend on October5,
2006 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September21, 2006. The Company issued 199million shares of common stock as a result of the stock split. In addition, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the
exercise of outstanding stock options and the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the Companys employee benefit plans were proportionately increased in accordance with the terms of those respective agreements and
plans. The transaction reduced additional paid-in capital by $02 million and increased common stock by $02 million. All share and per share data except par value for all periods presented have been restated to reflect the stock split.

Controls and Procedures  In
accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Companys Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Companys Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December31, 2007 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Companys reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms, and such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Companys
Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appears on page 30 of this annual report on Form 10-K. There has been no change in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended December31, 2007 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Companys internal controls over financial reporting.
