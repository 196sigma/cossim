REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To TransCoastal Marine Services, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
TransCoastal Marine Services, Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of
operations and other comprehensive income loss, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of TransCoastal
Marine Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has experienced recent
operating losses, negative cash flows, debt covenant violations, significantly
decreased liquidity and in 2000, has failed to meet debt service requirements of
certain of its debt agreements. Additionally, as discussed in Notes 1 and 11,
should there be an adverse outcome related to the collection of a receivable
from a Mexican joint venture or should significant payments be required to
resolve existing disputes with a customer, the Company liquidity and viability
would be further negatively impacted. The Company is expected to continue to
experience negative cash flows as it pursues its business strategy which will
necessitate additional financing. The Company has not secured any commitments
for any such additional financing requirements, and there can be no assurance
that the Company will be able to meet its obligations as they become due or be
able to restructure the debt with its lenders and other creditors. These matters
raise substantial doubt as to the Company ability to continue as a going
concern. Management plans with regard to these matters are also described in
Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or
the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the
Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

TRANSCOASTAL MARINE SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Business and Organization
TransCoastal Marine Services, Inc. TCMS was organized in April 1996, to
create a fully integrated marine construction company focusing on transition
zone and shallow water regions of the U.S. Gulf Coast. On November 4, 1997, TCMS
acquired, simultaneously with the closing of its initial public offering the
Offering, four privately owned marine construction businesses the Founding
Companies and certain real properties used in the businesses of the Founding
Companies in exchange for consideration consisting of cash, common stock of TCMS
the Common Stock and debt assumption. Unless otherwise indicated, all
references herein to the Company mean TransCoastal Marine Services, Inc.,
after the Offering, and references to TCMS mean TransCoastal Marine Services,
Inc., prior to the consummation of the acquisitions of the Founding Companies.
The Woodson Companies Woodson, one of the Founding Companies, was
identified as the accounting acquiror for financial statement presentation
purposes. The acquisitions of the remaining Founding Companies were accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting, with the results of operations
included from October 31, 1997, the effective closing date of the acquisitions
for accounting purposes. The allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed was assigned and recorded based on fair value of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Financial Condition
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. For the year ended
December 31, 1999, the Company incurred a net loss of $1043 million and also
had a working capital deficit at December 31, 1999 of $666 million due to the
classification of long-term debt as current as a result of covenant violations
on the debt. The Company has also experienced negative operating cash flows,
failed to comply with certain debt covenants and in 2000, has failed to meet
debt service requirements of certain of its debt agreements. Additionally,
should there be an adverse outcome related to the collection of a receivable
from a Mexican joint venture see Note 11 or should significant payments be
required to resolve existing disputes with a customer see Note 11, the
Company liquidity and viability would be further negatively impacted. The
Company is expected to continue to experience negative cash flows as it pursues
its business strategy, which will necessitate additional financing. The Company
has not secured any commitments for additional financing and there can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to meet its obligations as they become
due or be able to restructure the debt with its lenders. The debt covenant
violations could cause the lenders to seek remedies including asset seizure
and/or asset liquidation. These matters raise substantial doubt as to the
Company ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial
statements do not reflect any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of
liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a
going concern. Management is currently pursuing new third party equity
investments, waivers of covenant violations, amendments to the debt covenants or
forbearance from its lenders as well as other recapitalization opportunities
that might become available. There is no assurance that the Company will
actually complete any financial recapitalization. In the absence of a
satisfactory recapitalization, the Company anticipates its liquidity problems
will likely continue, and the Company may be forced to seek protection from its
creditors through bankruptcy.
The current state of the oil and gas services industry in which the Company
operates has been adversely impacted by the uncertainty and volatility in oil
and natural gas commodity prices. These factors have adversely impacted the
major and independent oil and gas exploration and production companies, certain
drilling contractors, hydrocarbon transportation companies and other marine
construction companies collectively, the Company Customer Base. The
Company customer base has reacted to this environment by reducing capital
spending on oil and gas exploration projects. The Company continues to be
affected by these industry factors into 2000.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Pro forma net income for 1997 consists of the historical net income of the
Company, including two S Corporations, adjusted for income taxes that would have
been recorded had each company operated as a C Corporation for all of 1997.
Use of Estimates
The Company financial statements are prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles GAAP. Financial statements prepared
in accordance with GAAP require the use of management estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
Additionally, management estimates affect the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period see revenue recognition policy. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents excluding certain
restricted amounts.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 years to 315 years. Leasehold
improvements are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of the lives of the
leases or the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company reviews the
carrying value of property and equipment for impairment whenever factors
indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be realizable. Impairment
losses would be recorded when an asset carrying value exceeds its fair value.
Fair value is generally based on third party appraisals, discounted cash flows
or management estimates. See Note 5 regarding a $103 million loss on asset
impairment recorded in 1999.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when
incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which extend the
useful lives of existing equipment, are capitalized and depreciated.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid by the
Company over the fair market value of the net tangible assets acquired. Goodwill
is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years, which represents
management estimation of the related benefit to be derived from the acquired
businesses. The Company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances
after the acquisition date indicate that the remaining balance of goodwill may
not be recoverable. If factors indicate that goodwill should be evaluated for
possible impairment, the Company would compare estimated undiscounted future
cash flow from the related operations to the carrying amount of goodwill. If the
carrying amount of goodwill was greater than undiscounted future cash flow, an
impairment loss would be recognized. Any impairment loss would be computed as
the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the estimated fair value of
the goodwill calculated based on discounting estimated future cash flows.
Accumulated amortization of goodwill was
26

TRANSCOASTAL MARINE SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED 03 million, $22 million and $907 million as of December 31, 1997, 1998 and
1999, respectively. See Note 5 regarding an $863 million loss on goodwill
impairment recorded in 1999.
Dry-dock Costs
Dry-dock costs are third-party costs associated with scheduled maintenance
on the Company marine construction vessels. Costs incurred in connection with
dry-docking are capitalized and amortized over the period to the next scheduled
dry-docking.
Mobilization Costs
Mobilization costs incurred on moving marine vessels and associated
equipment to their contractual locations to commence operations are capitalized
and amortized over the contract term.
Debt Issuance Costs
Debt issuance costs are included in other noncurrent assets and are
amortized to interest expense over the scheduled maturity of the debt. As of
December 31, 1998 and 1999, debt issuance costs, net of accumulated
amortization, were $15 million and $23 million, respectively.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues from construction contracts, which are typically less than twelve
months in duration, are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method. Under
this method, the percentage of completion is determined by comparing contract
costs incurred to date with total estimated contract costs. Income is recognized
by applying the percentage complete to the projected total income for each
contract in progress. Contract costs include all direct material, labor and
subcontract costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such
as indirect labor, supplies and tools. Revisions in cost and income estimates
are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts requiring revision
become known. In addition, anticipated losses to be incurred on contracts in
progress are charged to income in the period such losses are determined. With
regard to pipeline testing services performed, the Company recognizes revenues
as services are provided.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company considers the fair value of all financial instruments to not be
materially different from their carrying values at each year-end based on
management estimate of the Company ability to borrow funds under terms and
conditions similar to those applicable to the Company existing debt.
Income Taxes
The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected
future tax consequences of events that have been recognized differently in the
financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities
and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted
tax rates and laws in effect in the years in which the differences are expected
to reverse. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for realization based on a
more-likely-than-not criteria in determining if a valuation allowance should be
provided. Income tax expense is the tax payable for the year and the change
during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Two of the three companies comprising the Woodson Companies elected to be
taxed as S Corporations for federal and state income tax purposes whereby
shareholders are liable for individual federal and state income taxes on their
allocated portions of the applicable entity taxable income. Upon the closing
of the Offering, the S Corporation status was changed to that of a C
Corporation. Accordingly, the historical
27
30
TRANSCOASTAL MARINE SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
financial statements as they relate to the period prior to the Offering do not
include provisions for income taxes relating to those entities.
Concentrations of Credit
The Company Customer Base potentially exposes the Company to
concentrations of credit risk. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluation of
its customers and requires posting of collateral or lien rights when deemed
appropriate. The Company provides allowances for possible credit losses when
necessary.
Income Loss Per Share
Basic income loss per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing
net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period. Diluted income loss per share reflects the potential dilution
that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were
exercised or converted into common stock.
The weighted average number of common shares outstanding used to compute
basic and diluted income loss per share for the year ended December 31, 1997
were 3,363,000 and 3,393,000, respectively. The weighted average number of
common shares outstanding used to compute basic and diluted income loss per
share for years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999 were 9,583,000 and 10,951,000,
respectively. Calculation of diluted earnings loss per share is similar to
basic income loss per share except that the denominator includes dilutive
common stock equivalents such as stock options and warrants. Common stock
equivalents are excluded from fully diluted calculations in those periods in
which a net loss is reported as they would be anti-dilutive. Weighted average
shares outstanding for calculation of diluted income loss per share totaled
3,393,000, 9,583,000, and 10,951,000 for 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively.
Weighted average diluted shares outstanding at December 31, 1997 included 30,000
shares related to a warrant issued to a financial advisory firm that provided
services in conjunction with the Acquisitions see Note 3.
Reclassifications
The accompanying consolidated financial statements for prior years contain
certain reclassifications to conform with current year presentation.
3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
On November 4, 1997, TCMS acquired in separate transactions collectively,
the Acquisitions, simultaneously with the closing of the Offering, the
Founding Companies and certain real properties used in the businesses of the
Founding Companies. The Acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting. The aggregate consideration paid for the Acquisitions was
$857 million in cash, issuance of $30 million in 8% notes payable over a
ten-year term ending in 2007, and 2,142,441 shares of Common Stock. Funding of
the cash portion of the consideration was provided by funds raised through the
Offering. The purchase price allocations resulted in goodwill recognized of
$715 million representing the excess of purchase price over fair value of the
net assets acquired. The goodwill allocation includes $140 million of excess
purchase price attributable to the 975,000 shares of Common Stock issued to the
founders of TCMS during 1996 which were revalued to a fair market value of
$1440 per share.
On September 1, 1998, the Company consummated the acquisition of Dickson
GMP International, Inc. and four affiliated companies Dickson for $10
million in cash and 1,300,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company and an
earn-out. In May, 1999, in final settlement of the earn-out with Dickson, the
Company paid an additional $47 million in cash, issued 800,000 shares of common
stock to the former stockholders of Dickson.

In September of 1999, the Company completed a functional review of its
Fabrication & Offshore Group operations and foreign and domestic facilities.
As a result of this review, the Company recorded a special charge in the amount
of $17 million $10 million, net of tax, or $009 per diluted share for year
ended December 31, 1999. The components of the charge consists of: a $12
million severance costs related to former employees terminated as a result of
the Company 1999 headcount reduction initiative and b $05 million in costs
associated with the closing of foreign facilities and reduction in operations in
Nigeria and South America.
In December 1998, under direction of the Company new chief executive
officer appointed in November 1998, the Company management undertook a
comprehensive review of its operations, properties and lease commitments and
personnel. As a result of this review, the Company recorded a special charge in
the amount of $24 million $16 million, net of tax, or $017 per diluted
share. The components of the charge consist of: a $18 million severance
costs related to former officers and employees terminated as a result of the
Company 1998 headcount reduction initiative and b $06 million for the
estimated loss on the planned sale of facilities resulting from the planned
consolidation of certain operating facilities. These actions were completed in
1999.
At December 31, 1998 and 1999, the net realizable value of the land,
buildings, and improvements held for sale totaled $34 million, and has been
included in other current assets in the accompanying 1998 and 1999 balance
sheets. Additionally, accrued liabilities totaling approximately $13 million
and $22 million as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, respectively, have been
recorded for severance and other costs related to the change in the Company
operating plan. For 1999, these amounts are preliminary in nature pending the
ultimate sale of identified facilities.
5. LOSS ON ASSET IMPAIRMENT
As described in Note 1, the Company Customer Base has been adversely
impacted by the uncertainty and volatility in oil and natural gas commodity
prices, which has adversely impacted the Company operations, resulting in
negative cash flows, operating losses, debt covenant violations and
significantly decreased liquidity, all of which have continued in 2000. These
factors have caused the Company future to be uncertain and management to
evaluate the realization of the Company long-lived assets, including property,
equipment and goodwill.
In accordance with the Company policies for evaluating impairment, and
based on forecasts and other objective data, management believes it is unlikely
that the Company will recover any of the carrying value of
29
32
TRANSCOASTAL MARINE SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
goodwill. The entire $863 million balance of goodwill as of December 31, 1999,
has been impaired and accordingly is being written-off.
The Company also recorded an impairment write-off of approximately $103
million related primarily to the Company vessels, barges and certain leasehold
improvements. The impairment was in part based on current forecasts as well as
independent appraisals on specific assets. After recording the total of $966
million in impairment allowances, the Company remaining net book value
approximates the Company current market capitalization, further supporting
management decision.
Although the Company Customer Base has been adversely impacted by
uncertainty and volatility for several years, the Company had generated income
and positive cash flow from operations for the years ended December 31, 1997 and
1998. Based on management prior assessments of the realization of the
Company assets, no impairment was considered necessary in prior years. The
prolonged nature and severity of the adverse industry conditions resulted in the
Company financial difficulties as previously described. The Company
financial difficulties became critical in the latter half of 1999 and have
continued into 2000. Management believes the impairments were appropriately
recorded in the fourth quarter of 1999.

Credit Facility
In January 1999, the Company entered into a Credit Facility with
financial institutions, replacing the existing credit agreement with an
aggregate credit facility of $70 million. The Credit Facility is comprised of
three separate credit agreements: a a three year revolving credit agreement
Revolving Facility for up to $150 million; b a seven year term credit
agreement Term Loan for $350 million, and c a five year subordinated debt
agreement Subordinated Debt of $200 million.
In November 1999 the Company renegotiated the terms of its Revolving
Facility to reduce the facility to $100 million and amend the financial
covenants. At that time the Company also obtained waivers for financial covenant
defaults at September 1999. Borrowings under the Revolving Facility bear
interest on a sliding scale of 175 to 275 basis points over either the Base Rate
or LIBOR, depending upon the ratio of senior funded debt to the Company
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA. The
choice of using the Base Rate or the LIBOR rate is at the option of the Company.
The Base Rate is defined as the
32
35
TRANSCOASTAL MARINE SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
higher of the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points or the prime rate.
Interest is payable monthly. At December 31, 1999, the average interest rate on
borrowings under the Revolving Facility was 9%. The borrowing capacity under the
Revolving Facility is calculated using a borrowing base that includes accounts
receivable and inventory. At December 31, 1999, the Company was in default with
regard to certain financial and other covenants. The Company is currently
seeking waivers for these defaults. However, there can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to obtain such waivers. Therefore, the outstanding balance
of $75 million at December 31, 1999, has been classified as current in the
accompanying financial statements.
In November 1999 the Company renegotiated the terms of its Term Loan to
increase the then outstanding balance of the facility by $50 million and
amended the financial and other covenants. At that time the Company also
obtained waivers for financial covenant defaults at September 1999. Borrowings
under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 250 basis points. At
December 31, 1999, the interest rate on borrowings under the Term Loan was 86%.
Principal and interest are due monthly beginning January 1, 2000 with the first
principal payment being in the amount of $1,083,000. The remaining balance is to
be paid in 46 payments of approximately $542,000 plus interest; 25 payments of
approximately $437,000 plus interest, and the final payment for the then
outstanding balance plus interest. At December 31, 1999, the Company is in
default with regard to certain financial and other covenants and subsequent to
year-end has failed to meet the scheduled debt service payment requirements of
the Term Loan. The Company is currently seeking waivers for these defaults.
However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such
waivers. Therefore, the outstanding balance of $373 million at December 31,
1999 has been classified as current in the accompanying financial statements.
In November 1999 the Company re-negotiated the terms of its Subordinated
Debt and amended the financial covenants. At that time the Company also obtained
waivers for financial and other covenant defaults at September 1999. Borrowings
under the Subordinated Debt bear interest on a sliding scale of 275 to 575 basis
points over the Prime Rate depending upon the ratio of senior funded debt to the
Company earnings before EBITDA. The Prime Rate is defined as the higher of the
federal funds rate plus 50 basis points or the prime rate. At December 31, 1999,
the interest rate on borrowings under the Subordinated Debt was 143%. Interest
is payable quarterly beginning March 31, 1999, with principal due upon maturity
on the fifth anniversary of the subordinated debt agreement. At December 31,
1999, the Company is in default with regard to certain financial and other
covenants. The Company is currently seeking waivers for these defaults. However,
there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such waivers.
Therefore, the outstanding balance of $200 million at December 31, 1999 has
been classified as current in the accompanying financial statements.
Commitment fees on the daily average unused commitment under the Revolving
Facility are payable monthly at an annual rate ranging from 025% to 375%.
Borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured by liens on substantially all
of the Company assets including accounts receivable and subsequently acquired
property and a pledge of the capital stock of all subsidiaries. The Credit
Facility requires the Company to comply with various loan covenants, including
a maintenance of certain financial ratios, b restrictions on additional
indebtedness and c restrictions on liens, guarantees, advances and dividends.
In connection with the Subordinated Debt, the Company issued to the subordinated
lender a warrant to acquire 233,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price
of $312 per share and cancelled the previously issued warrant to acquire
175,000 shares of Common Stock issued in conjunction with the 1997 credit
agreement. In November 1999 the Company issued the subordinated lender an
additional warrant to acquire 175,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise
price of $369 per share in conjunction with obtaining the waiver of the
September 1999 defaults and amendment to the financial covenants. The warrants
are exercisable for five years from the date of issuance. Upon issuance, the
408,000 warrants were valued at $668,000 based on fair market value as
determined by management and use of the Black-Scholes pricing mode.

Deferred income tax provisions result from temporary differences in the
recognition of revenues and expenses for financial reporting purposes and for
tax purposes. The tax effects of these temporary differences representing
deferred assets and liabilities result principally from the following in

approximately $420 million which is available to offset future taxable income.
Due to uncertainties regarding the Company ability to fully utilize the NOL
during the carryforward period, the Company has provided a valuation allowance
of approximately $93 million at December 31, 1999.
11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Chevron Dispute
In December 1999, Chevron Global Technologies Services Company Chevron
informed the Company of its intention to seek reimbursements totaling
approximately $270 million for various disputed billings associated with
certain fabrication projects. The Company has begun proceedings with Chevron in
order to bring a resolution to the matters regarding the disputed billings. At
December 31, 1999, the Company had outstanding two letters of credit, totalling
$86 million, issued in favor of Chevron. While the Company is unable to
estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure, if any, related to
this matter, it has made accruals for management estimate of the exposure. Due
to the evolving nature of the disputed items with Chevron, the inherent
shortcomings of the estimation process and other factors, amounts accrued could
vary significantly from amounts required to be paid, if any. If Chevron were to
prevail, it would have a significant impact on the operations of the Company
subsidiary, TransCoastal Fabrication & Offshore Group, Inc. formerly Dickson
GMP International, Inc. and the Company.
Contract Receivable
During 1999, the Company was informed that the Mexican joint venture, also
the general contractor, of one of the Company major vessel charter contracts
was in poor financial condition and would cease to perform construction in the
Gulf of Mexico. At December 31, 1999, the contract receivable outstanding was
$198 million. The Company has continued to negotiate with the joint venture as
to future payments. While the Company is unable to estimate precisely the
ultimate amount that may be collected, it has provided a reserve for
management estimate of amounts which may not be collected. The Company
believes that the current reserve is adequate to cover any uncollectable portion
of the contract receivable and expects final resolution of this matter will
occur during the second or third quarter of 2000.

Litigation
During 1998, the Company was involved in two class action lawsuits for
unspecified personal injury and property damages arising from events in October
1991 and January 1992 during the course of a pipeline installation project for a
third party gas transmission company. One of the class actions, involving
approximately 9,840 class members, entitled Rivera v. United Gas Pipeline Co.,
No. 28738, was instituted against Woodson Construction Company, Inc. on October
29, 1991 in the 40th Judicial District Court, Parish of St. John the Baptist,
State of Louisiana. This lawsuit was settled during 1998. The Company
contribution towards the settlement was approximately $50,000, and was expensed
in 1998. The second class action lawsuit, involving approximately 7,858 class
members, entitled Husseiney v. United Gas Pipeline Co., No. 29089, was
instituted on January 27, 1992 against Woodson Construction Company, Inc. in the
40th Judicial District Court, Parish of St. John the Baptist, State of
Louisiana. This lawsuit was settled during 1999. The Company contribution
towards the settlement was approximately $600,000, and was expensed in 1998.
The Company is involved in various other lawsuits arising in the ordinary
course of business, some of which involve substantial claims for damages. While
the outcome of these other lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty,
management believes these other matters will not have a material adverse effect
on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.
Consulting Agreements
During February 1997, TCMS entered into a consulting and financial advisory
agreement the Consulting Agreement with a promoter of TCMS J. The
Consulting Agreement provided for a monthly fee of $12,500 through the closing
of the Offering and was to provide for a monthly consulting fee and
non-qualified stock options under the 1997 Stock Option Plan. Shortly after the
Offering, the Consulting Agreement was terminated in exchange for the payment to
J of approximately $800,000. In connection with the Consulting Agreement, a
total of 36,667 options were issued to J The options expired concurrent with
the termination of the Consulting Agreement.
In April 1997, TCMS entered into consulting services agreements with
certain officers of the Company. Pursuant to these agreements, the officers
provided executive services in connection with the formation of TCMS and the
closing of the Offering. Expenses related to these contract services totaled
$64,000 through the closing of the Offering, at which time these agreements
terminated.
Employment Agreements
Members of the management team have executed employment agreements that
extend through November 2001 which provide for compensation of $590,000 and
$560,000 in 2000 and 2001, respectively.
12. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has a 401K Plan the Plan which provides for certain
contributions of up to 10 percent of the annual compensation of each
participant. The Plan includes employees of at least 21 years of age with 6
months of completed service. The Company obtained a favorable tax determination
letter from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the Plan. The Company
has agreed to fund 50% per dollar of contribution by an eligible employee, up to
contributions totaling 6% of the employee annual salary. The Company made
contributions to the Plan of $59,000, $359,000 and $447,000 in 1997, 1998 and
1999, respectively.

Operating Segments
The Company has two primary operating segments the Pipeline & Marine Group
and the Fabrication & Offshore Group. The Pipeline & Marine Group operations
focus on the construction, burial and testing of pipelines onshore, in the
transition zone and in water depths up to 800 feet. The Fabrication & Offshore
Group primary operations focus on the fabrication of shallow water barges,
drilling rigs and oil and gas production platforms. The two segments are managed
separately because each business requires different technology and marketing
strategies. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
described in the summary of significant accounting policies except that certain
corporate expenses such as amortization of goodwill as well as interest expense,
interest income and income taxes are not allocated between the segments in the
Company evaluation of segment profit or loss.

The Company foreign operations and sales to foreign locations are subject
to local government regulations and to uncertainties of economics and political
conditions of those areas. In addition, because of the impact of local laws, the
Company also conducts some of its foreign projects pursuant to arrangements in
which local entities participate in the project. Revisions to project revenues
or costs, including those arising from changes or revisions to foreign
regulatory requirements and revisions to arrangements with local entities, are
recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.
