effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures
pursuant to Rules13a-15b of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, Anchors chief
executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls
and procedures were effective. There were no changes in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting
during the fourth quarter of 2004 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange
Act Rule13a-15f. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements.
Management conducted an evaluation of
the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation under the Internal Control Integrated Framework,
management concluded that the internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December31, 2004. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2004 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
registered certified public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. ITEM 9B. Other Information. None. 35 Table of Contents PART III
