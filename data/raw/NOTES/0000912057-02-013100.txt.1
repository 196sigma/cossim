REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS   
To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BroadVision,Inc. and Subsidiaries: 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BroadVision,Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2001 and 2000, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2001. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BroadVision,Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2001, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. s/ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

BROADVISION,INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements      December31, 2001    
Note1Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Nature of Business 
BroadVision,Inc. collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company was incorporated in the state of Delaware on May13, 1993. The Company
develops and sells a comprehensive suite of enterprise self-service ESS applications and technology that enable organizations to conduct interactions, transactions and services in a
personalized self-service model. The Company products enable companies to organize dynamic profiles of Web and wireless users from volunteered data and observed behavior, deliver highly
specialized content in response to these profiles and securely execute transactions. As of December31, 2001, more than 100 partner firms around the world are working to ensure the Company
joint customers' success through complementary technology, applications, tools, and services offerings that extend and enhance customers' BroadVision implementations. 
Restatement of Financial Statements 
On April 1, 2002 we filed a Form10-Q/A to amend our quarterly Form10-Q for the third fiscal quarter ended September30, 2001 as filed on
November14, 2001. This Form10-Q/A was filed to reflect the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for that period. The restatement relates to
amounts under a single contract with a customer, which amounts we have subsequently determined should not have been recognized as revenue in the third quarter but should be recognized ratably over a
four year period. The Form10-Q/A revised the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended September30, 2001 and the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the
nine months ended September30, 2001 as follows: software license revenues have been decreased by $3,381,000 and services revenues have been decreased by $145,000 for the three and nine months
ended September30, 2001. In addition, the Form10-Q/A revised the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September30, 2001 as follows: unearned revenue has increased by $3,526,000. 
Acquisitions 
On June29, 2001, the Company completed its acquisition of Keyeon LLC, or Keyeon, formerly a joint venture in which the Company held an interest of
approximately 36%. As consideration for the acquisition, the Company issued 2,713,280 shares of its common stock valued at $136million to the other former participants in the joint venture,
which resulted in the Company owning 100% of the outstanding shares of Keyeon. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities, and the related results of
operations, are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company from the date of acquisition. Net assets were recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. The excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is included in goodwill and other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Amounts allocated to acquired in-process
technology were expensed in the period in which the acquisition was consummated see Note2. 
On
April14, 2000, the Company completed its acquisition of Interleaf,Inc. and its subsidiaries Interleaf pursuant to a statutory merger involving a
stock-for-stock exchange. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities, and the related results of operations, are included in
the consolidated financial statements of the Company from the date of acquisition. Net assets were recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value
of net assets acquired is included in goodwill and other intangible assets in the 
59  accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Amounts allocated to in-process technology were expensed in the period in which the acquisition was consummated see Note2. Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the Company opinion, the consolidated financial statements presented herein include all necessary adjustments, consisting of normal
recurring adjustments, to fairly state the Company financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods indicated. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain assumptions and estimates that
affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from estimates. 
Revenue Recognition  Overview  The Company revenue consists of fees for licenses of the Company software products, maintenance, consulting services, and customer training. Software is
generally licensed for development use and for its use in deployment of the customer website. Fees for deployment licenses are generally based on the number of persons who register on a customer
website using the Company software. The Company revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, as amended.  Software License Revenue  The Company licenses its products through its direct sales force and indirectly through resellers. In general, software license revenues are recognized when a
non-cancelable license agreement has been signed and the customer acknowledges an unconditional obligation to pay, the software product has been delivered, there are no uncertainties
surrounding product acceptance, the fees are fixed and determinable and collection is considered probable. If collectibility is not considered probable, revenue is recognized when the fee is
collected. Subscription-based license revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription period. 
Revenues
recognized from multiple-element software arrangements are allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair values of the elements, such as licenses for software
products, maintenance, consulting services or customer training. The determination of fair value is based on objective evidence, which is specific to the Company. The Company limits its assessment of
objective evidence for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management having the relevant authority to do so, for an element
not yet sold separately. If evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements, then revenue is recognized using the residual
method. Under the 
60  residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue. The
Company records unearned revenue for software license agreements when cash has been received from the customer and the agreement does not qualify for revenue recognition under the
Company revenue recognition policy. The Company records accounts receivable for software license agreements when the agreement qualifies for revenue recognition but cash or other consideration has
not been received from the customer.  Services Revenue  Consulting services revenues and customer training revenues are recognized as such services are performed. Maintenance revenues, which include revenues bundled
with software license agreements that entitle the customers to technical support and future unspecified enhancements to the Company products, are deferred and recognized ratably over the related
agreement period, generally twelve months. 
The
Company consulting services are delivered through BroadVision Global Services BVGS, which consists of consulting, maintenance, and training. Services that the Company provides
are not essential to the functionality of the software. This group provides consulting services, manages projects and client relationships, manages the needs of the Company partner community,
provides training-related services to employees, customers and partners, and also provides software maintenance services, including technical support, to the Company customers and partners. The
Company records reimbursement by its customers for out-of-pocket expenses as a reduction to cost of sales. 
Allowances and Reserves 
Occasionally, the Company customers experience financial difficulty after the Company records the sale but before payment has been received. The Company
maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company normal payment terms are 30 to 90days
from invoice date. If the financial condition of the Company customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The
Company records estimated reductions to revenue for potential returns of products by our customers. If market conditions were to decline, the Company may experience larger volumes of returns resulting
in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the return occurs. 
Restructuring 
Based on the downturn in the economy, the Company industry and its business, the Company has recorded restructuring charges to align its cost structure with
these changing market conditions and to create a more efficient organization. To the extent actual events and circumstances, such as the amount and timing of future sublease income, differ from
estimates made when the restructuring charges are recorded, the Company may increase or decrease income in the period such changes are noted. 
61  Legal Matters 
The Company current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based on claims for which it can estimate the amount and range of loss. The
Company has recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims, where there is a range of loss. Because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining
pending litigation, the Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome. As additional information becomes available, the Company will
assess the potential liability related to its pending litigation and revise its estimates, if necessary. Such revisions in the Company estimates of the potential liability could materially impact
the Company results of operations and financial position. 
Research and Development and Software Development Costs 
Under the criteria set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No86, Accounting for the Cost of Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed, development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products are expensed as incurred until
technological feasibility in the form of a working model has been established at which time such costs are capitalized and recorded at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. The costs
incurred subsequent to the establishment of a working model but prior to general release of the product have not been significant. To date, the Company has not capitalized any costs related to the
development of software for external use. Costs related to internally developed software and software purchased for internal use are capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position98-1, Accounting for Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. During fiscal 2001, the Company completed development of an employee
intranet. At December31, 2001, approximately $21million in capitalized costs related to this system were included in property and equipment. These costs will be depreciated over a
term of 2years. 
Advertising Costs 
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense is included in sales and marketing expense and amounted to $18million 29million and $18million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 
Prepaid Royalties 
Prepaid royalties relating to purchased software to be incorporated and sold with the Company software products are amortized as a cost of software licenses
either on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the royalty agreement or on the basis of projected product revenues, whichever results in greater amortization. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments, Long-Term Investments 
The Company considers all debt and equity securities with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. 
62  The
Company short-term investments consist of debt and equity securities that are classified as available-for-sale. The Company debt securities
are carried at fair value with related unrealized gains or losses reported as other comprehensive income loss, net of tax. The Company long-term investments include debt securities
that are classified as available-for-sale. These securities have remaining maturities greater than one year from December31, 2001. These investments are carried at fair
value with related unrealized gains or losses reported as other comprehensive income, net of tax. 
All
short term investments have a remaining maturity of twelve months or less. Total short-term and long-term investment unrealized gains losses were $21million
and $432 million for the years ended December31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Total realized gains during fiscal 2001 and 2000 were $20million and $36million,
respectively, and are included in other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Financial assets that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments, long-term investments and trade accounts receivable. The Company markets and sells its products throughout the world and performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses. For the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, no one customer accounted for more than 10% of fiscal year total
revenue. As of December31, 2001 and 1999, no one customer individually accounted for more than 10% of the Company accounts receivable. As of December31, 2000, two customers
individually accounted for more than 10% of the Company accounts receivable. These customers accounted for 10% and 11% of accounts receivable, respectively. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The Company financial instruments consist of cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and debt. The Company does not have any derivative financial instruments. The Company believes the reported carrying amounts of its financial instruments approximates fair value, based upon the
maturities and nature of its cash equivalents, 
64  short-term investments, long-term investments, accounts receivable and payable, and based on the current rates available to it on similar debt issues. Equity Investments 
The Company equity investments consist of equity investments in public and non-public companies that are accounted for under either the cost method
of accounting or the equity method of accounting. Equity investments are accounted for under the cost method of accounting when the Company has a minority interest and does not have the ability to
exercise significant influence. These investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value when readily determinable market values exist or at cost when such market values do
not exist. Adjustments to fair value are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss unless the investments are considered other than temporarily impaired in which case the adjustment
is recorded as a component of other income expense, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Equity investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting when the Company has a
minority interest and has the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at cost with periodic adjustments to carrying value for
equity in net income loss of the equity investee. Such adjustments are recorded as a component of other income expense, net. Any decline in value of the Company investments, which is other than
a temporary decline, is charged to earnings during the period in which the impairment occurs. 
The
total fair value of the Company cost method long-term equity investments in public and non-public companies was $56million with a cost basis of
$277million. This includes $115million and $10million of write-downs during 2001 and 2000, respectively, of investments due to an other than temporary decline in fair value.
The total unrealized loss, net, during the year ended December31, 2001 in the Company cost method long-term equity investments was $23million. The Company did not hold
any equity method investments as of December31, 2001. However, the Company did hold an equity method investment during the year ended December31, 2001 prior to the acquisition of the
remaining interest in Keyeon as discussed in Note2. The total equity in net losses realized during the twelve months ended December31, 2001 was $24million. The equity in net
losses realized is recorded as a component of other income expense, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives two to eight years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the lesser of the remaining life of the lease term or their estimated useful lives. Depreciation expense for the year ended December31, 2001 was
$254million. The Company recorded asset impairments of approximately $368million in connection with the Company restructuring plan, which is included in the Company restructuring
charge recorded in the Company Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company also recorded a $31million loss on sale and disposal of excess assets which is included in other income
expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Note1Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued  Valuation of Long-Lived Assets 
The Company periodically assesses the impairment of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangibles, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of. The Company
determines that an impairment occurred when the asset undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. The Company calculates the impairment loss as the amount that the
carrying value of the asset exceeds the discounted future cash flows. The Company recorded a charge of $62million related to specific intangible assets. The Company also periodically assesses
the impairment of enterprise level goodwill in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No17, Intangible
Assets. The Company asseses goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company
considers important which could trigger an impairment include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results, significant changes in the
manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the Company overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, a significant decline in the Company stock price for a
sustained period and the Company market capitalization relative to net book value. When the Company determines that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of
one or more of the above indicators of impairment, the Company measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in its
current business model. During the year ended December31, 2001 the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of of $3302million See Note4. 
Employee Stock Option and Purchase Plans 
The Company accounts for employee stock-based awards in accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No44 FIN 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensationan Interpretation of APB No25, and related interpretations. As such, compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant only if the current
market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price. Pursuant to SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company
discloses the pro forma effects of using the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation arrangements. The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees
in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No123 and Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other
Than Employees For Acquiring or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services. 
Stock Splits 
On February8, 2000, the Company Board of Directors declared a three-for-one common stock split in the form of a stock dividend
for Stockholders of record as of February21, 2000. The stock dividend payment date was March13, 2000 and the Company common stock traded ex-dividend starting
March14, 2000, reflecting the three-for-one stock split. 
66  On
September29, 1999, the Company Board of Directors declared a three-for-one common stock split in the form of a stock dividend for Stockholders of
record as of October11, 1999. The stock dividend payment date was October25, 1999 and the Company common stock traded ex-dividend starting October26, 1999,
reflecting the three-for-one stock split. 
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements and related financial information contained herein have been retroactively restated to give effect for the February2000 and
September1999 stock splits. Per Share Information 
Basic earnings loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding less shares subject to repurchase. Diluted
earnings loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and, when dilutive, common equivalent shares from outstanding stock options and warrants
using the treasury stock method and shares subject to repurchase. The following table sets forth the basic and diluted earnings loss per
share computational data for the periods presented. Excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December31, 2001 and 2000, are options and warrants to
acquire 10,772,000 and 34,816,000 shares of common stock, respectively, because their effects would be anti-dilutive. Years Ended December 31 2001

The functional currency of the Company foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are included in other income
expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and, to date, have not been significant. 
67  Comprehensive Income Loss 
Comprehensive income loss includes the Company net income loss and all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by or
distributions to owners. 
For
the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, comprehensive income loss was $8372 million, $1919 million, and $415million, respectively. The components of
other comprehensive income loss for these periods relate solely to net income loss and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments. 
Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets 
Income taxes are computed using an asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred
tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and
deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of the enacted tax law; the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. The measurement of deferred tax assets is
reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. 
The
Company analyzes its deferred tax assets with regards to potential realization. The Company has established a valuation allowance on a significant portion of its deferred tax assets
based upon the uncertainty of their realization. The Company has considered estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the
valuation allowance. Segment and Geographic Information 
The Company operates in one segment, electronic commerce business solutions. The Company chief operating decision maker is considered to be the Company Chief
Executive Officer CEO. The CEO reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by geographic region and by product for
purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. Reclassifications 
Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
New Accounting Pronouncements 
On June29, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB approved for issuance SFAS No141, Business
Combinations, and SFAS No142, Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Major provisions of these Statements are as follows: all
business combinations initiated after June30, 2001 must use the purchase method of accounting; the pooling of interest method of accounting is prohibited except for transactions initiated
before July1, 2001; intangible assets acquired in a business combination must be recorded separately from goodwill if they arise from contractual or other legal rights or are separable from
the acquired entity and can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or as part of a related contract, asset or liability; goodwill and intangible 
68  assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually using a fair value approach, except in certain circumstances, and whenever there is an impairment
indicator; other intangible assets will continue to be valued and amortized over their estimated lives except assembled workforce which, pursuant to SFAS No141, will not be recognized as an
intangible asset apart from goodwill; in-process research and development will continue to be written off immediately; all acquired goodwill must be assigned to reporting units for
purposes of impairment testing and segment reporting and effective January1, 2002, existing goodwill will no longer be subject to amortization. 
Upon
adoption of SFAS No142, on January1, 2002, the Company will no longer amortize goodwill. Amortization for the year ended December31, 2001 was
$2025million. Additionally, upon adoption of SFAS No141 and 142, the Company will no longer amortize its non-technology based intangible asset, or assembled workforce.
Amortization for the non-technology based intangible asset was $27million for the year ended December31, 2001. During fiscal 2001, the Company recorded an impairment
charge of $3302million related to goodwill and $62million related to other intangible assets primarily as part of the Interleaf acquisition which closed on April14, 2000 see
Note4. 
Pursuant
to SFAS No142, the Company is required to test its goodwill for impairment upon adoption and, if impairment is indicated, record such impairment as a cumulative effect
of an accounting change. The Company has evaluated the effect the adoption of SFAS No142 may have on its consolidated results of operation and financial position and determined there would be
no accounting charge to record upon adoption. 
In
August2001, the FASB issued SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,
which supersedes both SFAS No121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion
No30, Reporting the Results of OperationsReporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously
defined in that Opinion. SFAS No144 retains the fundamental provisions in SFAS No121 for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long-lived assets held for use
and long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with SFAS No121. For example, SFAS No144 provides
guidance on how a long-lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment, establishes criteria for when a long-lived asset is held for sale, and
prescribes the accounting for a long-lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale. SFAS No144 retains the basic provisions of APB No30 on how to present
discontinued operations in the statement of operations but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business. Unlike SFAS No121, an
impairment assessment under SFAS No144 will never result in a write-down of goodwill. Rather, goodwill is evaluated for impairment under SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
The Company is required to adopt SFAS No144 no later than the fiscal year beginning after
December15, 2001, and plans to adopt its provisions for the quarter ending March31, 2002. Management does not expect the adoption of SFAS No144 to have a material impact on
the Company consolidated results of operations and financial position. 
In
November2001, the staff of the FASB reached consensus on Topic No.D-103, on the topic of Income Statement Characterization of
Reimbursements Received for Out of Pocket Expenses Incurred. This topic addresses whether reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred should be 
69  characterized in the income statement as revenue or as a reduction of expenses incurred. The FASB staff concluded that reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred should be
characterized as revenue in the income statement. This announcement will be applied in financial reporting periods beginning after December15, 2001, and comparative financial statements for
prior periods will be reclassified to comply with the guidance in this announcement. The Company is currently recording reimbursement by its customers for out-of-pocket expenses as a reduction to cost
of sales. Thus, there will be no impact on the Company gross margin or net income but adoption will increase its services revenue and its services cost of revenue. 
Note2Acquired and Disposed Businesses 
Keyeon 
On June29, 2001, the Company completed its acquisition of Keyeon, formerly a corporate joint venture in which the Company held an interest of
approximately 36%. The acquisition was completed primarily to obtain technology to extend functionality of the Company existing products. As consideration for
the remaining interest in Keyeon, the Company issued 2,713,280 shares of its common stock valued at $136million to the other participants in the joint venture which resulted in the Company
owning 100% of the outstanding shares of Keyeon. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities, and the related results of operations, are included in
the consolidated financial statements of the Company from the date of acquisition. The purchase price allocation is as follows in thousands: Purchase price, net of cash acquired 6,395 Add: fair value of liabilities assumed 4,007 Total purchase consideration 10,402 Less: fair value allocated to acquired assets 3,104 Excess of purchase consideration over acquired assets and assumed liabilities 7,298 Excess allocated to Acquired in-process technology 6,418 Goodwill 880 At
December31, 2001, accumulated amortization related to goodwill acquired in the Keyeon acquisition totaled $246,000. As discussed in Note1, the Company will no longer
amortize goodwill in accordance with SFAS No142 but will periodically test for impairment under the provisions of SFAS No142. The Company estimated that $64million of the
purchase price for Keyeon represented acquired in-process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. Accordingly, this amount was
immediately charged to expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The income approach methodology was used to value the acquired in-process technology. Under the income
approach, fair value reflects the present value of the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the products, incorporating the acquired technologies under development, assuming they will
be successfully completed. These cash flows are discounted at a rate appropriate for the risk of the asset. The rate of return depends upon the stage of completion which 
70  was estimated at fifty percent. An overall after-tax discount rate of thirty percent was applied to the cash flows expected to be generated by the products incorporating technology currently under
development. 
The
following summary, prepared on an unaudited pro forma basis, reflects the condensed consolidated results of operations for the twelve-month period ended December31, 2001 and
December31, 2000 assuming Keyeon had been acquired at the beginning of the periods presented in thousands, except per share data: 2001
2000 Revenue 244,498 413,916 Net loss 834,071 163,511 Basic and diluted net loss per share 302 063 The
pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred if the acquisition had been in effect for the periods presented. In addition, they are not intended to be
a projection of future results and do not reflect any synergies that might be affected from combined operations. The charges for acquired in-process technology have not been included in the unaudited
pro forma results because they are nonrecurring. 
Interleaf 
On April14, 2000, the Company completed its acquisition of Interleaf,Inc. and its subsidiaries Interleaf pursuant to a statutory merger
involving a stock-for-stock exchange. Interleaf software products and related services enable automated electronic business, or e-business, and also enable the
extension of e-business to wireless users. Interleaf provides customers with an integrated, easily implemented e-business solution based on extensible Markup Language, or XML,
that enables the design, creation and management of XML-based content for transformation and delivery over the Web and related services. As a result of the acquisition, the Company has the
ability to combine technological resources to develop a robust Web-based business solution and reduce time to market for the combined Company products. Through the acquisition of all of
the equity securities of Interleaf, BroadVision acquired all of the assets and assumed liabilities of Interleaf and its existing operations which included in-process technology. Pursuant
to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of January26, 2000, each outstanding share of Interleaf common stock was exchanged for 10395 shares of Company
common stock and all options to purchase shares of Interleaf
common stock outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger were converted into options to purchase shares of Company common stock. 
The
Company issued 14,391,991 shares of Company common stock with a fair market value of $6869million and exchanged options to purchase 2,338,342 shares of Company common stock
with a fair market value of $1027million. The fair market value of the exchanged options to purchase 2,338,342 shares of Company common stock was valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model. In connection with the acquisition, the Company incurred transaction costs consisting primarily of financial advisor, legal and accounting professional fees of $148million, severance
costs of $10million and office closure costs of $13million, resulting in a total purchase price of $8067million. The results 
71  of operations of Interleaf have been included with the Company results of operations since the April14, 2000 acquisition date. The
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination. Under this accounting treatment, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on the estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. 
The
total purchase price paid for the Interleaf acquisition was allocated as follows in thousands: Property and equipment 2,896 Net tangible liabilities assumed, excluding property and equipment 1,041 Identifiable intangible assets 28,910 In-process technology 10,100 Goodwill 765,805 Total 806,670 The
amounts allocated to intangible assets include completed technologies of $204million and assembled workforces of $85million. 
At
December31, 2001, accumulated amortization related to the goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in the Interleaf acquisition totaled $3983million. Goodwill
amortization was $3828million and other intangible asset amortization was $155million. The goodwill and other intangible assets are being amortized over a three-year
period. 
The
Company estimated that $101million of the purchase price for Interleaf represented acquired in-process technology that had not yet reached technological
feasibility and had no alternative future use. Accordingly, this amount was immediately charged to expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations upon consummation of the acquisition. The value
assigned to acquired in-process technology was the amount attributable to the efforts of Interleaf up to the time of acquisition. The amount was estimated through the application of the
stages of completion by multiplying the estimated present value of future cash flows, excluding, cost of completion, by the percentage of completion of the purchased technology at the time of the
acquisition. The discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired in-process technology. The
following summary, prepared on an unaudited pro forma basis, reflects the condensed consolidated results of operations for the twelve-month period ended December31, 2000 and
1999 assuming Interleaf had been acquired at the beginning of the periods presented in thousands, except per share data: 2000
1999 Revenue 427,579 167,159 Net loss 236,519 255,180 Basic and diluted net loss per share 089 106 72 
The
pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred if the acquisition had been in effect for the periods presented. In addition, they are not intended to be
a projection of future results and do not reflect any synergies that might be affected from combined operations. The charges
for in-process technology have not been included in the unaudited pro forma results because they are nonrecurring. On
April30, 2001 and May15, 2001, the Company entered into agreements with third parties to sell certain assets and liabilities of E-Publishing Corporation,
formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, which was acquired as part of the acquisition of Interleaf in April2000. The Company recorded a loss on sale of assets of approximately
$13million related to the disposition. 
Fidutec 
On November24, 1999, the Company acquired all of the registered shares of Fidutec Information Technology SA for a cash payment of 6,000,000 Swiss Francs
equivalent U.S. dollar value of $3,765,000, net of cash acquired. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities, and the related results of operations,
are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company from the date of acquisition. The name of the acquired business has been subsequently changed to BroadVision Professional Services.
The purchase price was allocated based on fair values as follows in thousands: Purchase price, net of cash acquired 3,765 Add: fair value of liabilities assumed 399 Total purchase consideration 4,164 Less: fair value allocated to acquired assets 798 Excess of purchase consideration over acquired assets and assumed liabilities 3,366 Excess allocated to Prepaid compensation 2,749 Goodwill 617 Pro
forma revenue, net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share data, assuming Fidutec had been acquired at the beginning of 1999 and 1998 is not materially
different from actual results excluding the effect of Fidutec.

Note4Goodwill and Other Intangibles 
Goodwill and other intangibles consist of the following: December 31 2001
2000 Goodwill 437,206 766,446 Completed technology 15,236 20,400 Assembled workforce 7,496 8,510 459,938 795,356 Less Accumulated amortization 399,071 187,855 Goodwill and other intangibles, net 60,867 607,501 The
Company periodically assesses the impairment of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangibles, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No121. The
Company also periodically assesses the impairment of enterprise level goodwill in accordance with the provision of APB Opinion No17. Based on quantitative and qualitative measures, the
Company assesses the need to record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when impairment indicators are present. 
During
the third quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company performed an impairment assessment of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill recorded in connection with its various
acquisitions. The impairment assessment was performed primarily as a result of the significant decline in the Company stock price, the net book value of assets significantly exceeding the Company
market capitalization, the underperformance of the Interleaf acquisition relative to projections, and the overall decline in industry growth rates which have negatively impacted the Company revenues
and forecasted revenue growth rate which indicate that this trend might continue for an indefinite period. Also, current economic indicators forecast that this trend may continue for an indefinite
period. As a result, the Company recorded a $3364million impairment charge during the third quarter of 2001 to reduce goodwill by $3302million and other intangible assets by
$62million associated with the Company acquisitions, primarily the Interleaf acquisition, to their estimated fair value. To determine other than temporary impairment for identifiable
intangibles, the sum of the current undiscounted cash flows was compared to the current carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows were greater than or equal to the current carrying value the
asset is deemed not to be impaired. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the current carrying value then the asset is deemed impaired. A discounted cash flow analysis is then prepared and the
difference between the carrying value and the discounted cash flows represents the charge taken in accordance with SFAS No121. To determine the impairment loss for goodwill, the Company
determined the fair value using a business enterprise methodology which includes a terminal value assigned to the entity. This value is then compared to the carrying value of stockholders' equity, and
if less, the difference represents the impairment to be recorded. The assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows, including the estimated terminal values, reflect management best
estimates. The discount rate was based upon the weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies. 
It
is reasonably possible that the estimates and assumptions used under our assessment may change in the short term, resulting in the need to further write-down the goodwill
and other long-lived 
74  assets. The Company assessed the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets during the fourth quarter of 2001 and no further impairment was deemed necessary. 
As
discussed in Note1, upon adoption of SFAS No142, on January1, 2002, the Company will no longer amortize goodwill. The Company has identified the assembled
workforce as an intangible asset which does not meet the criteria of recognizable intangible asset as defined by SFAS No142. The remaining other intangible assets are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over their remaining useful life of 15months, subject to certain effects of the new accounting pronouncements described in Note1. Amortization expense
is estimated to be $35million in 2002 and $887,000 in 2003.

The Company has various credit facilities with a commercial lender which include term debt in the form of notes payable and a revolving line of credit. As of
December31, 2001 and December31, 2000, outstanding term debt borrowings were approximately $39million and $49million, respectively. Borrowings bear interest at the
bank prime rate 475% and 95% as of December31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Principal and interest are due in consecutive monthly payments through maturity based on the term of the
facility. Principal payments of $977,000 are due annually through 2004, $611,000 due in 2005, and a final payment of $357,000 due in 2006. As of December31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had no
outstanding borrowings under its revolving line of credit. However, commitments totaling $24million in the form of standby letters of credit were issued under its revolving line of credit
facility
as of December31, 2001 and 2000. Commitments totaling $226million and $230million in the form of standby letters of credit were also issued from separate financial
institutions as of December31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The commercial credit facilities include covenants which impose certain restrictions on the payment of dividends and other
distributions and required the Company to meet a financial covenant. Borrowings are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of the Company owned assets. In August2001 the
Company signed an amendment to the loan agreement which removes the financial covenant and requires the Company to maintain a $100million deposit in the bank. No other advances will be
available under the revolving line of credit.

Company has provided a valuation allowance for a significant portion of its deferred tax assets as of December31, 2001 due to the uncertainty regarding their
realization. The total valuation allowance increased $105,177,000 from December31, 2000 to December31, 2001. Approximately $1,600,000 of the increase in the valuation allowance relates
to income tax benefits arising from the 
77  exercise of stock options that will be credited directly to stockholders' equity and will not be available to benefit the income tax provision in any future periods. The remaining increase in the
valuation allowance relates to net operating losses and accrued liabilities. 
As
of December31, 2001, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $283,224,000 and $47,326,600 respectively, available to offset future
regular and alternative minimum taxable income. In addition, the Company had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $9,948,815 and $2,221,653 respectively,
available to offset future tax liabilities. The Company federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards expire in the years 2002 through 2020, if not utilized. The state net operating loss
carryforwards expire in the years 2004 through 2010. The state research and development credits can be carried forward indefinitely. As of December31, 2001 the Company foreign subsidiaries
had net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions of approximately $3,500,000 that can be used to offset future foreign income. 
Federal
and state tax laws limit the use of net operating loss carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company. The Company believes such an
ownership change, as defined, may have occurred and, accordingly, certain of the Company federal and state net operating loss carryforwards may be limited in their annual usage. Note8Commitments and Contingencies 
On February 15, 2002, BroadVision and Hewlett-Packard signed an agreement, which terminated Hewlett-Packard rights to resell BroadVision software effective

The Company leases its headquarters facility and its other facilities under noncancelable operating lease agreements expiring through the year 2013. Under the
terms of the agreements, the Company is required to pay property taxes, insurance and normal maintenance costs. 
A
summary of future minimum lease payments is as follows in thousands; properties that are part of the restructuring have been excluded: Year Ended December 31, 2002 6,910 2003 5,915 2004 8,338 2005 17,594 2006 16,635 2007 and thereafter 175,038 Total minimum lease payments 230,430 78

As of December31, 2001, the Company had $250million of outstanding commitments in the form of standby letters of credit in favor of the Company

Legal Proceedings 
In April 2001, the Company filed a Form8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission reporting that several purported class action lawsuits
had been filed against the Company and certain of its officers and directors. In each of the lawsuits, the plaintiffs seek to assert claims on behalf of a class of all persons who purchased securities
of BroadVision between January26, 2001 and April2, 2001. The complaints allege that BroadVision and the individual defendants violated federal securities laws in connection with its
reporting of financial results during such period. The lawsuits have been consolidated into a single action, as is customary in such cases. On November5, 2001, BroadVision and the individual
defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated complaint. On February22, 2002, the Court granted these motions, dismissed the consolidated complaint without prejudice and ordered the
lead plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 30days. On March25, 2002, the plaintiff filed its Second Amended Consolidated Complaint, which added claims for breach of fiduciary
duty and named
members of the Company board of directors as additional defendants. The Company anticipates that it will file a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Consolidated Complaint during May 2002. The
hearing on this motion to dismiss has yet to be scheduled. The Company believes that the lawsuits are without merit and continues to defend itself vigorously. 
On
June7, 2001, Verity,Inc. filed suit against the Company alleging copyright infringement, breach of contract, unfair competition and other claims. The Company has
answered the complaint denying all allegations and is defending itself vigorously. 
The
Company is also subject to various other claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the
ultimate disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on the Company business, financial condition or results of operations. Although management currently believes that the
outcome of other outstanding legal proceedings, claims and litigation involving the Company will not have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition,
litigation is inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance that existing or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company business, results of operations of
financial condition 
Note9Restructuring 
During 2001, the Company approved a restructuring plan to, among other things, reduce its workforce and consolidate facilities. These restructuring and asset
impairment charges were taken to align the Company cost structure with changing market conditions and to create a more efficient organization. A pre-tax charge of $1533million
was recorded during 2001 which includes severance and benefits charges, lease abandonment costs, asset impairment charges and other incremental costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring.
The Company recorded the restructuring charge at the 
79  low-end of a range, in accordance with SFAS No5, Accounting for Contingencies. The high-end of the range is estimated
at $2431million, an increase in the restructuring charge of $898million. Actual future cash requirements may differ materially from the accrual at December31, 2001,
particularly if actual sublease income is significantly different from current estimates. Adjustments to the restructuring reserves will be made in future periods, if necessary, based upon the then
current actual events and circumstances.

Note9Restructuring Continued 
During the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company revised its estimates and expectations with respect to its facilities disposition efforts due to
further consolidation and abandonment of additional facilities and to account for changes in estimates based upon actual events and circumstances. Based on the factors above, an additional

costs, net of anticipated sublease income, is expected to be utilized by the end of fiscal 2008. OtherThe
