The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated
financial statements. 55 Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2005
1. The Company
Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. Millennium or
the Company is a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering,
developing and commercializing innovative products in disease areas with unmet
medical needs. The Company currently markets VELCADE, the market leader in the
multiple myeloma relapsed setting. The Company also has a number of other
potential therapeutic products in various stages of clinical and preclinical
development in its therapeutic areas of disease focus.
Millenniums strategy is
to develop and commercialize important new medicines through clinical trials
and regulatory approvals and to play a significant role in the marketing and
sale of many of these products. The Company plans to develop and commercialize
many of its products on its own, but will also seek development and commercial
collaborators on favorable terms or when it would otherwise be advantageous to
the Company.
2. Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of
Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Millennium and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
The preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts
in operating activities of the consolidated statements of cash flows have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. This reclassification
has no impact on previously reported net loss or net cash used in operating
activities in any period.
Cash Equivalents,
Marketable Securities and Other Investments
Cash equivalents consist principally of money market
funds and corporate bonds with maturities of three months or less at the date
of purchase. Marketable securities consist primarily of investment-grade
corporate bonds, asset-backed debt securities and U.S. government agency
debt securities. Other investments represent ownership in private companies in
which the Company holds less than a 20 percent ownership position and does not
otherwise exercise significant influence. The Company carries such investments
at cost unless significant influence can be exercised over the investee, in
which case such securities are recorded using the equity method. These other
investments are included in other long-term assets at December31, 2005
and December31, 2004.
Management determines the appropriate classification
of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such
designation at each balance sheet date. Marketable securities at December31,
2005 and December31, 2004 are classified as available-for-sale.
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized
gains and losses reported in a separate component of stockholders equity. The
cost of debt securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and
accretion are included in  56  Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2005 Continued investment income.
Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be
other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities and other investments are
included in investment income. The cost of securities sold is based on the
specific identification method. Interest and dividends on securities classified
as available-for-sale are included in investment income.
During the years ended December31, 2005, 2004
and 2003, the Company recorded realized gains on marketable securities of
$01million, $19million and $63million, respectively, and
realized losses on marketable securities and other investments of
$36million, $136million and $33million, respectively.
During the year ended December31,
2005, the Company recorded a realized gain of approximately $105 million from
the sale of its cost method investment in TransFormPharmaceuticals,Inc.
TransForm. The Company expects to record an additional realized gain of up
to approximately $28million in the second half of 2006 upon the final
settlement and receipt of the escrowed portion of the sale proceeds. TransForm,
a company specializing in the discovery of formulations and novel crystalline
forms of drug molecules, was acquired by Johnson Johnson in a cash-for-stock
transaction that closed in April2005.
Concentrations of
Credit Risk
Cash and cash equivalents
are primarily maintained with two major financial institutions in the United
States. Deposits with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such
deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and, therefore,
bear minimal risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company
to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of marketable securities.
Marketable securities consist of investment-grade corporate bonds, asset-backed
and U.S. government agency securities. The Companys investment policy,
approved by the Board of Directors, limits the amount the Company may invest in
any one type of investment, thereby reducing credit risk concentrations.
Accounts receivables include trade receivables which result from product sales
to a sole distributor and amounts due under strategic alliances. Concentration
of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited by credit limits,
ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures.
Segment Information
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information SFAS No131,
establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report
information about operating segments in their financial statements. SFAS No131
also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services,
geographic areas, and major customers.
The Company operates in one business segment, which
focuses on the research, development and commercialization of therapeutic
products. All of the Companys product sales are currently related to sales of
VELCADE. All of the Companys co-promotion revenue is related to sales of
INTEGRILIN through August31, 2005. The remainder of the Companys total
revenues is related to its strategic alliances and royalties.
Revenues from Ortho Biotech Products, L.P. Ortho
Biotech, a member of the Johnson Johnson Family of Companies
accounted for approximately 10percent, 17percent and 11 percent of
consolidated revenues for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.   57  Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2005 Continued Revenues from Schering-PloughLtd. and Schering
Corporation collectively SGP, excluding co-promotion revenue, accounted for
approximately 24 percent of total revenues for the year ended December31,
2005.
Revenues from sanofi-aventis Group sanofi-aventis
accounted for approximately two percent, twopercent and 15percent
of consolidated revenues for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.
Revenues from Bayer, AG Bayer accounted for
approximately less than one percent, twopercent and 14percent of
consolidated revenues for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.
There were no other
significant customers under strategic alliances and royalties in 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.
Information
Concerning Market and Source of Supply Concentration
INTEGRILIN has received regulatory approvals in the
United States, the countries of the European Union and a number of other
countries for various indications. The Company and SGP co-promoted INTEGRILIN
in the United States and shared any profits and losses through August31,
2005. In September2005, SGP acquired the exclusive development and
commercialization rights to INTEGRILIN in the United States from the Company.
The Company continues to manage the supply chain for INTEGRILIN at the expense
of SGP for products sold in the SGP territories. In the European Union,
GlaxoSmithKline plc GSK exclusively markets INTEGRILIN.
The Company relies on third party contract
manufacturers for the clinical and commercial production of INTEGRILIN. The
Company has two manufacturers that provide eptifibatide, the active ingredient
necessary to make INTEGRILIN for both clinical trials and commercial supply.
Solvay, Societe Anonyme Solvay, one of the current manufacturers, owns the
process technology used by it and the other manufacturer for the production of
the active pharmaceutical ingredient. The Company is seeking approval of its
own alternative process technology for the production of eptifibatide for
approval in the United States, Europe and other countries as required. The
Company entered into an agreement with Solvay in January2003 for an
initial term of four years and one-year renewal periods thereafter. The Company
has two manufacturers that currently perform fill/finish services for
INTEGRILIN. The Company has identified an alternative packaging supplier to
serve as future sources of supply for the United States. The FDA or other
regulatory agencies must approve the processes or the facilities that may be
used for the manufacture of our marketed products. Materials in process at
these alternative suppliers are included in inventory.
The Company also relies on third party contract
manufacturers for the manufacturing, fill/finish and packaging of VELCADE for
both commercial purposes and for ongoing clinical trials. The Company has
established long-term supply relationships for the production of the active
pharmaceutical ingredient and the fill/finish of VELCADE. The Company currently
works with one manufacturer to complete fill/finish for VELCADE and the Company
is qualifying a second fill/finish supplier.
During 2004, the Company
began distributing VELCADE in the United States through a sole-source
distribution model where the Company sells directly to a third party who in
turn distributes to the wholesaler base.   58  Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2005 Continued Inventory
Inventory consists of currently marketed products,
including VELCADE and INTEGRILIN, and from time to time, product candidates
awaiting regulatory approval which were capitalized based upon managements
judgment of probable near term commercialization. The Company assesses the
probability of commercialization based upon several factors including estimated
launch date, time to manufacture and shelf life. At December31, 2005 and
2004, inventory does not include amounts for products that have not been
approved for sale.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in,
first out or market. Inventories are reviewed periodically for slow-moving or
obsolete status based on sales activity, both projected and historical.

On February12, 2002, the Company acquired COR
Therapeutics,Inc. COR for an aggregate purchase price of
$18billion, primarily consisting of 551 million shares of Millennium
common stock. The transaction was recorded as a purchase for accounting
purposes. The purchase price was allocated to the assets purchased and
liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values, with the excess of
the purchase price over the estimated fair market value of net tangible assets
acquired allocated to in-process research and development, developed
technology, trademark and goodwill.
CORs developed technology consisted of an existing
product, INTEGRILIN and related patents. This developed technology was
determined to be separable from goodwill and was valued at approximately
$4350million. Because the INTEGRILIN name was well recognized in the
marketplace and was considered to contribute to the product revenue, the
trademark was determined to be separable from goodwill. The INTEGRILIN trademark
was valued at approximately $590million and is considered to have an
indefinite life.
Intangible assets that were not specifically
identifiable, had indeterminate lives or were inherent in the continuing
business and related to the Company as a whole were classified as goodwill. The
significant factors contributing to the existence of goodwill at the time of
acquisition related to company management, a specialized cardiovascular sales
force, market position and operating experience.
Amortization
of intangibles is computed using the straight-line method over the useful lives
of the respective assets as follows 
Developed technology
13 years
Core technology
4 years
Other
2 to 12 years
Amortization expense was
approximately $340million, $335million and $389million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During the year ended December31,
2005, the Company retired intangible assets of approximately $30 million that
had been fully amortized. In addition, in
connection with the 2003 restructuring plan discussed in Note3, the
Company recognized an impairment charge in the year ended December31,
2003 of approximately $113million for technology it no longer intends to
pursue.
The Company expects to incur amortization expense of
approximately $340million for each of the next five years.   60  Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2005 Continued As required by SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not
amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if
impairment indicators arise. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to
have an indefinite life are amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances suggest that the assets may
not be recoverable. The Company tests for goodwill impairment annually, on October1,
and whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable.
On October1, 2005, the Company performed its
annual goodwill impairment test and determined that no impairment existed on
that date. The Company continually monitors business and market conditions,
including the restructured relationship with SGP, to assess whether an
impairment indicator exists. If the Company were to determine that an impairment
indicator exists, it would be required to perform an impairment test which
might result in a material impairment charge to the statement of operations.
Goodwill as of December31,
2005 consists of the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net
tangible and intangible assets primarily related to the Companys acquisition
of COR in 2002, as well as previous acquisitions of Leukosite,Inc. LeukoSite
and Cambridge Discovery Chemistry, LTD. The carrying value may be adjusted as a
result of the continued settlement of contingent consideration arising from the
Leukosite acquisition.
Fair Value of
Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts
reported in the Companys balance sheets for other current assets, current
portion of long-term debt and long-term debt approximate their fair value. The
fair values of the Companys long-term debt are estimated using discounted cash
flow analyses based on the Companys current incremental borrowing rates for
similar types of borrowing arrangements.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes
revenue from the sale of its products, its co-promotion collaboration through August31,
2005, strategic alliances and royalties. The Companys revenue arrangements
with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if
specified criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has stand-alone
value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of
the fair value of the undelivered items. The consideration received is
allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values, and
the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate
units. Advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as
deferred revenue until earned.
Net product sales
The Company records
product sales of VELCADE when delivery has occurred, title passes to the
customer, collection is reasonably assured and the Company has no further
obligations. Allowances are recorded as a reduction to product sales for
estimated returns and discounts at the time of sale. During the fourth quarter
of 2004, the Company reduced its reserve for product returns by approximately
$15million based upon actual returns to date and inventory levels at the
wholesalers. No further material adjustments have been recorded for estimated
product returns and discounts. Costs incurred by the Company for shipping and
handling are recorded in cost of sales.   61 Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2005 Continued
Co-promotion
revenue
Through August31, 2005, co-promotion revenue
included the Companys share of profits from the sale of INTEGRILIN in co-promotion territories by
SGP. Also included in co-promotion revenue were reimbursements from SGP of the
Companys manufacturing-related costs, development costs, advertising and
promotional expenses associated with the sale of INTEGRILIN within co-promotion
territories and royalties from SGP on sales of INTEGRILIN outside of the
co-promotion territory other than Europe. The Company recognized revenue when
SGP shipped INTEGRILIN to wholesalers and recorded it net of allowances, if
any. The Company deferred specified manufacturing-related expenses until the
time SGP shipped related product to its customers inside and outside of
co-promotion territories and outside of Europe.
Beginning September1, 2005, as a result of the
Companys transition from a co-promotion to a royalty arrangement for
INTEGRILIN in the United States, the Company no longer reports co-promotion
revenue.
Revenue under
strategic alliances
The Company recognizes revenue under strategic
alliances from nonrefundable license payments, milestone payments,
reimbursement of research and development costs and reimbursement of
manufacturing-related costs. Nonrefundable upfront fees for which no further
performance obligations exist are recognized as revenue on the earlier of when
payments are received or collection is assured.
Nonrefundable
upfront licensing fees and guaranteed, time-based payments that require continuing
involvement in the form of research and development, manufacturing or other
commercialization efforts by the Company are recognized as revenue ratably
over the development period if development risk is significant ratably
over the manufacturing period or estimated product useful life if development
risk has been substantially eliminated, or
based
upon the level of research services performed during the period of the research
contract.
Milestone payments are recognized as revenue when the
performance obligations, as defined in the contract, are achieved. Performance
obligations typically consist of significant milestones in the development life
cycle of the related technology, such as initiation of clinical trials, filing
for approval with regulatory agencies and approvals by regulatory agencies.
Reimbursements of research
and development costs are recognized as revenue as the related costs are
incurred.
Royalties
Beginning on September1,
2005, in connection with the closing of the Companys amended collaboration
agreement with SGP, as discussed in Note 4, the Company began to record royalty
income. Royalties are recognized as revenue when earned. Royalties may include royalties
earned on sales of INTEGRILIN in the United States and other territories around
the world, as provided by SGP royalties
earned on international sales of VELCADE, as provided by Ortho Biotech 62  Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2005 Continued royalties
earned on sales of INTEGRILIN in Europe, as provided by GSK; and
other
royalties.
Advertising and
Promotional Expenses
Advertising and
promotional expenses are expensed as incurred. During the years ended December31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, advertising and promotional expenses were $358 million 434million and $370million, respectively.
Income Taxes
The liability method is
used to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on differences between financial reporting and income tax
basis of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss carryforwards,
and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect
when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate
realization. Specified reclassifications of prior years amounts have been made
to the Companys notes to consolidated financial statements to conform to the
current year presentation.
Net Loss Per Common
Share
Basic net loss per common
share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the period, excluding restricted stock that has been issued
but is not yet vested. Diluted net loss per share is based upon the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus additional
weighted average common equivalent shares outstanding during the period when
the effect is not anti-dilutive. Common equivalent shares result from the
assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants the proceeds of
which are then assumed to have been used to repurchase outstanding stock using
the treasury stock method and unvested restricted shares of common stock. Options to purchase shares of common stock that
were not included in the calculation of diluted shares because the effect of
including the options would have been anti-dilutive were 28 million, 63
million and 81 million at December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Foreign Currency Translation
The financial statements
of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as
the functional currency, with results of operations and cash flows translated
at average exchange rates during the period, and assets and liabilities
translated at end of period exchange rates. Foreign currency transaction gains
and losses are included in the results of operations and are not material to
the Companys consolidated financial statements. Translation adjustments are
excluded from the determination of net loss and are accumulated in a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity.
Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss is
comprised of net loss, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities and
cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments. Accumulated other
comprehensive loss as of December31, 2005 and 2004 included unrealized
losses of $97 million and $54 million, respectively, on marketable securities
and $01 million and $06 million, respectively, of cumulative foreign
currency  63  Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2005 Continued translation
adjustments. Comprehensive loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of
stockholders equity.
Stock-Based
Compensation
The Company follows the intrinsic value method under
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees APB 25 and related interpretations, in accounting for its
stock-based compensation plans, rather than the alternative fair value
accounting method provided for under SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS No123 as amended by SFAS No148, Accounting
for Stock-based CompensationTransition and Disclosure SFAS No148.
Under APB 25, when the exercise price of options granted equals the market price
of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is
recognized. Restricted stock awards are recorded as compensation cost over the
requisite vesting periods based on the market value on the date of
grant.In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 96-18,
the Company records compensation expense equal to the fair value of options
granted to non-employees over the vesting period, which is generally the period
of service.
The following information regarding net loss and net loss
per share has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee
stock options and employee stock plan under the fair value method prescribed by
SFAS No123, as amended by SFAS No148. The resulting effect on net
loss and net loss per share pursuant to SFAS No123 is not likely to be
representative of the effects in future periods, due to subsequent additional
option grants and periods of vesting.
The
following table illustrates the effect on net loss and loss per share if the
Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No123
to stock-based employee compensation in thousands, except per share

Stock-based compensation expense as disclosed above
was recorded on an accelerated basis in accordance with FASB Interpretation No28,
Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or
Award Plans. Adjustments for
forfeitures were made in the period in which they occurred.
The weighted-average per share fair value of
options granted during 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $456, $839 and $751,
respectively. 64  Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2005 Continued The
fair value of stock options and common stock issued pursuant to the stock
option and stock purchase plans at the date of grant were estimated using the
Black-Scholes model with the following weighted-average
assumptions

The Black-Scholes model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. Option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. The
Companys employee stock options have characteristics significantly different
from those of traded options and changes in the subjective inputs assumptions
can materially affect the fair value estimate.
Through the end of the second quarter of 2004, the
fair value of stock options granted was determined utilizing a historical
volatility rate. In the third quarter of 2004, the Company reevaluated and
subsequently changed its expected volatility assumption. The Company now uses
the most recent three-year time period for purposes of calculating the expected
volatility. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2005, in preparation for the
adoption of SFAS No123R, the Company considered implied volatilities of
currently traded options to provide an estimate of volatility based upon
current trading activity. After considering other such factors as its stage of
development, the length of time the Company has been public and the impact of
having a marketed product, the Company believes this blended volatility rate
better reflects the expected volatility of its stock going forward. The blended
volatility rate was used beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005.
The Company has never
declared cash dividends on any of its capital stock and does not expect to do
so in the foreseeable future.
Accounting
Pronouncements
In December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No123R
revised 2004, Share-Based Payment,
SFAS No123R. SFAS No123R requires companies to
calculate and record in the income statement the cost of equity instruments,
such as stock options or restricted stock, awarded to employees for services
received. The cost of the equity instrument is to be measured based on the fair
value of the instruments on the date they are granted and is required to be
recognized over the period during which the employees are required to provide
services in exchange for the equity instruments. SFAS No123R is
effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June15,
2005, or January1, 2006.
SFAS No123R
provides two alternatives for adoption a
modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized for all
awards granted subsequent to the effective date of the statement as well as for
the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of the effective date; or 65  Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2005 Continued a
modified retrospective method which follows the approach in the modified
prospective method, but also permits entities to restate prior periods to
record compensation cost calculated under SFAS No123 for pro forma
disclosure.
The Company adopted SFAS No123R using the
modified prospective method as of January1, 2006. As permitted by SFAS No123,
the Company historically accounted for share-based payments to employees
using the intrinsic value method under APB 25 and, as such, generally
recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the
adoption of SFAS No123Rs fair value method will have a significant
impact on the Companys results of operations, although it will have no impact
on its overall financial position. The Company estimates this expense to be in
the range of $400 million to $500 million in 2006, dependent upon market
price, assumptions used in estimating the fair value and the levels of
share-based payments granted in 2006. Changes in market price and other of the
Companys assumptions could cause future expenses to vary significantly from
the Companys current expectations.
In May2005, the FASB
issued SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections SFASNo154
which replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinions No20, Accounting
Changes and SFAS 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
StatementsAn Amendment of APB Opinion No28. SFAS No154 provides
guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error
corrections. It establishes retrospective application, or the earliest
practicable date, as the required method for reporting a change in accounting
principle and restatement with respect to the reporting of a correction of an
error. SFAS No154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of
errors made in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. Although
the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No154, the
Company does not currently believe that adoption will have a material impact on
results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
3. Restructuring
2005 Strategic
Refinement
In October2005, the Company announced its 2005
restructuring plan in support of a refined business strategy focused on
advancing key growth assets, including VELCADE, advancing the Companys
clinical pipeline of seven novel oncology and inflammation molecules and
building a leading oncology-focused discovery organization. In connection with
the strategic refinement, the Company has substantially reduced its effort in
inflammation discovery and has reduced overall headcount, including eliminating
INTEGRILIN sales and marketing positions, positions in inflammation discovery
and various other business support groups. As a result of the headcount
reductions, the Company is also evaluating potential further consolidation of
its Cambridge, MA facilities.
The Company recorded restructuring charges of
approximately $425 million under the 2005 restructuring plan primarily related
to the remaining rental obligation, net of sublease income, of vacated
facilities, the impairment charge on leasehold improvements that were abandoned
at such facilities and employee termination benefits for the 180 employees
affected by the transfer of the U.S. commercialization rights to INTEGRILIN to
SGP, as well as the headcount reductions within inflammation discovery and
business support groups. 66 Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2005 Continued
These
costs are included in restructuring in the statements of operations and in
current and long-term liabilities on the balance sheet at December31,
2005. The following table displays the restructuring activity and liability

The Company expects to record additional restructuring
charges of between $250 and $300million in 2006. The Company continues
to evaluate its strategic alternatives and as a result, future restructuring
charges could vary significantly from current operations.
2003 Restructuring
Plan
In December2002 and June2003, the Company
realigned its resources to become a commercially-focused biopharmaceutical
company. The Company discontinued specified discovery research efforts, reduced
overall headcount, primarily in its discovery group, and consolidated its
research and development facilities. Based upon a review of current real estate
market conditions, the Company recorded an additional $306 million of
restructuring expense in the third quarter of 2005 reflecting changes in the
Companys estimates of the length of time it would take to sublease certain
properties vacated under the 2003 restructuring plan.

67  Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2005 Continued The Company accounts for its restructuring charges in
accordance with SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit
or Disposal Activities SFAS No146. SFAS No146 requires that
a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized
and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability
is incurred, except for one-time termination benefits that meet specified
requirements. Costs of termination benefits relate to severance packages,
out-placement services and career counseling for employees affected by the
restructuring. Stock-based compensation amounts relate to modifications of
stock option grants to accelerate vesting and to extend the exercise period of
certain stock option grants upon termination.
In accordance with SFAS No146, the Companys
facilities related expenses and liabilities in both the 2005 and 2003
restructuring plans include estimates of the remaining rental obligations, net
of estimated sublease income, for facilities the Company no longer occupies.
The Company validates its estimates and assumptions with independent third
parties having relevant expertise in the real estate market. The Company
reviews its estimates and assumptions on a regular basis, until the outcome is
finalized, and makes whatever modifications are necessary, based on the Companys
best judgment, to reflect any changed circumstances.
The Companys decisions to vacate specified facilities
and abandon the related leasehold improvements as well as terminate specified
research programs were deemed to be impairment indicators under SFAS No144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. As a result
of performing the impairment evaluations, asset impairment charges were
recorded to adjust the carrying value of the related long-lived assets to their
net realizable values. The fair values of the assets were estimated based upon
anticipated future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk
involved. These amounts are included in asset impairment in the above tables.
The projected timing of
payments of the remaining restructuring liabilities under both the 2005 and the
2003 restructuring plans at December31, 2005 is approximately $354
million in 2006 and $695 million thereafter through 2022. The actual amount
and timing of the payment of the remaining accrued liability is dependent upon
the ultimate terms of any potential subleases or lease restructuring.
4. Revenue and
Strategic Alliances
The Company has entered
into research, development, technology transfer and commercialization
arrangements with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies relating to
a broad range of therapeutic products. These alliances provide the Company with
the opportunity to receive various combinations of license fees, research
funding, co-promotion revenue, distribution fees and may provide additional
payments contingent upon its achievement of research and regulatory milestones
and royalties and/or profit shares if the Companys collaborations are
successful in developing and commercializing products.
Product Alliances
In April1999, COR entered into a collaboration
agreement with SGP to jointly develop and commercialize INTEGRILIN on a
worldwide basis. The Company acquired COR in February2002. Under its
collaboration agreement with SGP, the Company generally shared any profits or
losses from the sale of INTEGRILIN in the United States with SGP based on the
amount of promotional efforts that each party contributed. Since the United
States launch of INTEGRILIN in June1998, the Company and SGP had agreed
to share promotional efforts in the United States equally, except for costs
associated with  68  Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2005 Continued marketing programs that
are specific to the Company. The Company had granted SGP an exclusive license
to market INTEGRILIN outside of the United States and European Union, and SGP
paid the Company royalties based on those sales.
In June2004, the Company reacquired the rights
to market INTEGRILIN in Europe from SGP and concurrently entered into a license
agreement granting GSK exclusive marketing rights to INTEGRILIN in Europe. In January2005,
the transition of the INTEGRILIN marketing authorization for the European Union
from SGP to GSK was completed and GSK began selling INTEGRILIN in the countries
of the European Union. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is
entitled to license fees and royalties from GSK on INTEGRILIN sales in Europe
upon the achievement of specified objectives. During the year ended December31,
2005, the Company recognized approximately $217 million of strategic alliance
revenue, excluding manufacturing-related cost reimbursements, from GSK.
On September1, 2005, the Company transferred to
SGP the exclusive development and commercialization rights to INTEGRILIN in the
United States. In exchange for these rights, SGP paid the Company approximately
$355 million in a nonrefundable upfront payment that the Company is
recognizing as revenue ratably over the Companys period of involvement in
managing the supply chain. In addition, SGP is obligated to pay the Company
royalties on product sales of INTEGRILIN over the lifetime of the product, with
the potential of receiving royalties beyond the 2014 patent expiration date.
As of September1, 2005, the Company no longer
records co-promotion revenue. The Company now records royalties on sales of
INTEGRILIN in the United States and other territories, as earned on a quarterly
basis over the life of the INTEGRILIN product. In each of 2006 and 2007,
minimum royalties are set at approximately $854 million. There are no
guaranteed minimum royalty payments beyond 2007.
Upon closing the amended collaboration agreement with
SGP, the Company recognized strategic alliance revenue of approximately $714
million in the third quarter of 2005 relating to the Companys sale to SGP of
the existing raw materials and finished goods INTEGRILIN inventory. SGP assumed
development obligations relating to the product. The Company continues to
manage the supply chain for INTEGRILIN at the expense of SGP for products sold in
the United States and other areas outside of the European Union.
In January2005, the Company repaid SGP
approximately $493million for advances SGP had made for inventory
purchases in prior years. This amount was included in Advance from Schering-Plough
in current liabilities at December31, 2004.
On June30, 2003, the Company entered into an
agreement with Ortho Biotech, a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson
Johnson, to collaborate on the commercialization and through the agreement with
Johnson Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Development,
L.L.C., or JJPRD, continue clinical development of VELCADE. Under the terms of
the agreement, the Company retains all commercialization rights to VELCADE in
the United States. Ortho Biotech and its affiliate, Janssen-Cilag, have
agreed to commercialize VELCADE outside of the United States. The Company is
entitled to royalties in the form of distribution fees from Ortho Biotech and
its affiliate on sales of VELCADE outside of the United States. The Company
also retains an option to co-promote VELCADE with Ortho Biotech at a future
date in specified European countries.
The Company is engaged with JJPRD in an extensive
global program for further clinical development of VELCADE with the purpose of
maximizing the commercial potential of VELCADE. This program is investigating
the potential of VELCADE to treat multiple forms of solid and hematological
cancers,  69  Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2005 Continued including continued
clinical development of VELCADE for multiple myeloma. JJPRD was responsible for
40% of the joint development costs through 2005 and will be responsible for 45%
of such costs thereafter.
In connection with the agreement, the Company received
a nonrefundable payment from Ortho Biotech of $150million in July2003.
In addition, the Company may receive payments for achieving clinical
development milestones, for achieving regulatory milestones outside of the
United States and for achieving agreed-upon sales levels of VELCADE. The
Company may also receive additional payments for achieving specified clinical
and regulatory approval milestones outside of the United States for additional
solid and hematological cancers and for achieving sales milestones outside of
the United States. During the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, the
Company recognized approximately $220million and $540million,
respectively, of milestone payments as revenue under this alliance.
Through its merger with
LeukoSite in 1999, the Company became a party to a joint venture agreement with
ILEX Products,Inc. ILEX to form Millennium and ILEX Partners, L.P. MI
for the purpose of developing and commercializing Campathalemtuzumab humanized monoclonal antibody
for use in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The Company accounted
for its investment in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting.
On December31, 2001, ILEX Oncology acquired the Companys equity interest
in MI which owns the Campath product in exchange for $200million
plus additional consideration contingent upon future sales of Campath. The
Company earned $400million of such consideration in each of 2004, 2003
and 2002. In addition, the Company may be entitled to additional payments from
ILEX Oncology based on future U.S. sales of Campath. However, the Company
currently does not expect that these thresholds will be achieved and therefore,
are unlikely to receive future additional payments related to Campath.
Research and
Discovery Alliances
On March9, 2001, the Company entered into a
strategic alliance with Abbott Laboratories Abbott for a five-year term in
the area of metabolic diseases. The Company and Abbott agreed to share the cost
of developing, manufacturing and marketing products on a worldwide basis. This
arrangement with Abbott also included a technology exchange and development
agreement and a $2500million equity investment agreement. As part of
this $2500million equity investment agreement, Abbott made investments
in 2002 and 2001 totaling $2214million. Abbott made the remaining
$286million investment in March2003.
On August8, 2003, the Company and Abbott agreed
to terminate their alliance covering joint discovery, development and
commercialization of metabolic disease products in connection with the Companys
June2003 restructuring plan. Included in restructuring charges for the
three months ended September30, 2003 are restructuring charges
specifically related to the discontinuation of metabolic research and
development, which include termination benefits and costs associated with the
Abbott separation agreement.
On June22, 2000, the Company entered into an
alliance with Aventis, now sanofi-aventis, covering the joint development and
commercialization of drugs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases; joint
development of new drug discovery technologies; transfer of key elements of the
Companys technology platform to Aventis to enhance its existing capabilities;
and purchase of an equity interest in the Company by sanofi-aventis. The
companies agreed to share the responsibility for and cost of developing, marketing
and manufacturing products arising from the alliance, as well as profits in
North America. Outside of North America, sanofi-aventis is responsible for
developing and marketing products arising from the alliance, with a royalty
obligation to the Company. Under a Technology Transfer Agreement, the  70  Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2005 Continued Company agreed to provide
sanofi-aventis with rights to its drug discovery technologies in exchange for
payments between $1600million and $2000million over a three to
five-year period. sanofi-aventis has purchased $2500million of the
Companys common stock as agreed under an Investment Agreement with the
Company.
On April22, 2003, sanofi-aventis exercised its
option to terminate the Technology Transfer Agreement between the Company and
sanofi-aventis effective on the third anniversary of the Agreement, July21,
2003. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, upon providing this notice to the
Company, sanofi-aventis paid the Company $400million in consideration
for future use of specified Millennium technology transferred to
sanofi-aventis, which is included in revenue under strategic alliances for the
year ended December31, 2003. The Company will not receive any additional
payments from sanofi-aventis under the Technology Transfer Agreement.
On October31, 2005, the discovery phase of the
sanofi-aventis agreement expired in accordance with its terms. The development
and commercialization programs continue under the agreement. During the
remaining portion of the development phase of the alliance, the Company and
sanofi-aventis will focus on preclinical and clinical development of candidates
identified in the collaboration.
On October31, 2003, the research phase of the
Companys five year strategic alliance with Bayer concluded. On October10,
2003, Bayer and Millennium amended the agreement to provide both parties access
to specified identified drug targets for a period of seven years. If Bayer
successfully develops and commercializes any of these targets discovered in the
alliance, Bayer may make success payments and royalties to Millennium on the
sale of products generated from the alliance.
Revenues recognized under
the research phase of the Bayer alliance were approximately $455million
for the year ended December31, 2003. The Company recognized the research
funding portion of the alliance on a percentage-of-completion basis. The
percentage-of-completion was determined at each measurement date based upon the
actual full-time equivalents to date as compared to managements estimate of
the total full-time equivalents needed to complete the deliverables required by
the alliance. In September2001, the Company revised the estimate of total
full-time equivalents required to complete the project downward as a result of
productivity improvements made at the Company and changes to the program
requirements made by Bayer. During each subsequent reporting period, the
Company continued to monitor the full-time equivalent estimate necessary to
complete the deliverables and compared the estimate to the actual effort put forth.
No further adjustments were necessary and the accounting estimates used
approximated actual efforts from September2001 to the end of the research
phase of the agreement, October31, 2003. 71  Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2005 Continued 5. Marketable

The unrealized losses on investments in corporate
bonds and asset-backed securities at December31, 2005 were generated from
354 and 88 securities, respectively. The majority of the securities in a loss
position greater than one year have been in an unrealized loss position for a
period of two to three years. The unrealized losses were caused by interest
rate increases, and not credit quality issues. To determine whether an other-than-temporary
impairment exists, the Company considered whether it has the ability and intent
to hold the investment until a market price recovery and considers whether
evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs
evidence to the contrary. Since the decline in market value is attributable to
changes in interest rates and the Company has the ability and intent to hold
these investments until a recovery of fair value, the Company does not consider
these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December31,
2005.
The Companys unrealized
losses at December31, 2005 on the Companys investment in United States
government agency securities were primarily caused by interest rate increases. The
contractual terms of those investments do not permit the issuer to settle the
securities at a price less than amortized cost of the investment. Because the
company has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery
of fair value, the Company does not consider these investments to be
other-than-temporarily impaired at December31, 2005.

maturity at a price equal to $3421 per share the 50% notes.
Under the terms of these notes, the Company is
required to make semi-annual interest payments on the outstanding principal
balance of the 50% notes on March1 and September1 of each year, of
the 45% notes on June15 and December15 of each year and of the

noteholders to require the Company on April29, 2003, to repurchase the
45% notes for cash at a price of $1,095 per $1,000 of principal amount and the
50% notes for cash at a price of $1,085 per $1,000 of principal amount,
resulting in a maximum aggregate payment obligation of $6540million.

principal amount of these notes was not tendered in the offer and remain
outstanding as of December31, 2005. As a result of the repurchase, the
Company recorded a charge in 2003 of approximately $105million which
represents the write-off of approximately $124million of unamortized original
debt issuance costs associated with the 45% notes and 50% notes, offset by
$19million relating to the expired put premium on the untendered notes.

At December31, 2005, the Company had unused net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $14 billion available to reduce
federal taxable income, expiring in 2006 through 2025 and $05billion
available to reduce state taxable income, expiring in 2006 through 2010. The
Company also has federal and net state research tax credits of approximately
$990million available to offset federal and state income taxes, both of which
expire beginning in 2006. Due to the degree of uncertainty related to the
ultimate use of the loss carryforwards and tax credits, the Company has fully
reserved these tax benefits.
Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
the amounts used for income tax  79  Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2005 Continued purposes. Significant components of the Companys

The valuation allowance increased by
$499million during 2005 due primarily to a net increase in temporary
items arising from timing differences of costs for financial accounting and tax
purposes, especially for capitalized research costs and amortized intangible
assets. Net operating loss carryforwards decreased as losses expiring during
the year exceeded current net operating losses from operations and stock
options exercises. The valuation allowance increased by $1146million
during 2004 due primarily to the increase in net operating loss carryforwards
from operations and stock option exercises, as well as a net increase in
temporary items arising from timing differences of costs for financial accounting
and tax purposes especially for capitalized research costs and amortized
intangible assets. The deferred tax assets acquired from COR, LeukoSite and
ChemGenics are subject to review and possible adjustments by the Internal
Revenue Service and may be limited due to the change in ownership provisions of
the Internal Revenue Code.

Transactions
In November2003, the Company sold specified
assets, including intellectual property to Portola Pharmaceuticals,Inc. Portola,
a company founded and owned in part by a member of Millenniums board of
directors. In exchange for these assets, the Company received Portola SeriesA
preferred convertible stock, representing less than a 5% ownership in Portola.
The investment in Portola is  80  Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2005 Continued accounted for using the
cost method and is included in other long-term assets on the balance sheet at December31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, commencing in June2004, Portola
sub-leased specified research facilities of the Company in South San Francisco,
CA. The Company believes these lease terms are comparable to those that would
be available from unaffiliated third parties. In August2004, the Company
entered into an additional transaction with Portola to license to Portola the
Companys Factor Xa inhibitor program in return for milestone and royalty
payments upon achievement of certain events. In December2005, the Company
entered into a transaction with Portola to license to Portola the Companys
Aggregometer system in exchange for cash and Portola SeriesB preferred
stock, which combined with the previous stock issued, maintains the Companys
ownership in Portola at less than5%. 81 Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2005 Continued
