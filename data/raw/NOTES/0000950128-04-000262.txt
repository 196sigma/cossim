NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In Millions, Except per Share Amounts
1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS
Lexmark International, Inc. Lexmark or the company is a leading developer,
manufacturer and supplier of printing solutions -- including laser and inkjet
printers, multifunction products, associated supplies and services -- for
offices and homes. The company also sells dot matrix printers for printing
single and multi-part forms by business users and develops, manufactures and
markets a broad line of other office imaging products. The principal customers
for the company products are dealers, retailers and distributors worldwide.
The company products are sold in over 150 countries in North and South
America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, the Pacific Rim and the
Caribbean.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local currency
environment are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates.
Income and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates prevailing
during the period. Adjustments arising from the translation of assets and
liabilities are accumulated as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive earnings in stockholders' equity.
Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the company evaluates
its estimates, including those related to customer programs and incentives,
product returns, doubtful accounts, inventories, intangible assets, income
taxes, warranty obligations, copyright fees, product royalty obligations,
restructurings, pension and other postretirement benefits, and contingencies and
litigation. The company bases its estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.
Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less
at the company date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.
Marketable Securities The company evaluates its marketable securities in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and classifies these investments as
held-to-maturity, trading or available-for-sale. Based on the company expected
holding period, the company has classified all of its
36 marketable securities as available-for-sale and reported these investments in
the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as current assets. The company
reports its available-for-sale marketable securities at fair value with
unrealized gains or losses recorded on the accumulated other comprehensive
earnings loss line in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
Realized gains or losses are included in net earnings and are derived using the
specific identification method for determining the cost of the securities.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The financial instruments of the company consist mainly of cash and cash
equivalents, marketable securities, trade receivables, short-term debt,
long-term debt and derivatives. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents,
trade receivables and short-term debt approximates their carrying values due to
the relatively short-term nature of the instruments. The fair value of
marketable securities approximates the company amortized cost, due to the
frequent resetting of interest rates resulting in repricing of the investments.
The fair value of long-term debt is based on current rates available to the
company for debt with similar characteristics. The fair value of derivative
financial instruments is based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments
or, if none are available, on pricing models or formulas using current
assumptions.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market. The company
considers all raw materials to be in production upon their receipt.
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their
estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Property, plant and
equipment accounts are relieved of the cost and related accumulated depreciation
when assets are disposed of or otherwise retired.
Internal Use Software Costs The company capitalizes direct costs incurred during the application development
and implementation stages for developing, purchasing, or otherwise acquiring
software for internal use. These software costs are included in property, plant
and equipment in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and are
depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software, generally three
years. All costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as
incurred.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with
SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS 142 no longer permits
the amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Instead,
the assets must be reviewed at least annually for impairment. The company
annually reviews its goodwill for impairment and currently does not have any
indefinite-lived intangible assets. The company goodwill and intangible assets
are immaterial, and therefore are not separately presented in the Consolidated
Statements of Financial Position.
Long-Lived Assets The company performs reviews for the impairment of long-lived assets whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated
undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and
its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. If future expected
undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the
37 assets, then an impairment loss is recognized based upon the excess of the
carrying value of the asset over the anticipated cash flows on a discounted
basis. The company also reviews any legal and contractual obligations associated
with the retirement of its long-lived assets and records assets and liabilities,
as necessary, related to the cost of such obligations.
Warranty Reserves In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 45 FIN 45, Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45, which are effective for financial
statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002, are
included below and in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time
revenue is recognized. The reserve for product warranties is based on the
quantity of units sold under warranty, estimated product failure rates, and
material usage and service delivery costs. The estimates for product failure
rates and material usage and service delivery costs are periodically adjusted
based on actual results. For extended warranty programs, the company defers
revenue in short-term and long-term liability accounts based on the extended
warranty contractual period for amounts invoiced to customers for these
programs and recognizes the revenue ratably over the contractual period. Costs
associated with extended warranty programs are expensed as incurred.
Revenue Recognition Accounting Changes
In December 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition, which superceded SAB 101, Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB 104 updated certain interpretive
guidance included in SAB 101, including the SAB 101 guidance related to multiple
element revenue arrangements, to reflect the issuance by the Emerging Issues
Task Force EITF of EITF 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables. The basic revenue recognition principles of SAB 101 were
largely unchanged by the issuance of SAB 104, and therefore, did not have a
material impact on the company financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.
In November 2002, the EITF issued EITF 00-21, Accounting for Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, which addresses revenue recognition
accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple
revenue-generating activities. The provisions of this pronouncement were
effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning
after June 15, 2003. The company accounts for arrangements with multiple
revenue-generating activities in accordance with EITF 00-21, as described in the
following subsection on multiple element revenue arrangements.
In 2001, the EITF reached a consensus that consideration from a vendor to a
purchaser of the vendor products should be characterized as a reduction in
revenue as stated in EITF 00-25, Accounting for Consideration from a Vendor to a
Retailer in Connection with the Purchase or Promotion of the Vendor Products,
and clarified in EITF 01-9. This EITF consensus was effective for annual or
interim financial statements beginning after December 5, 2001, with
reclassification required for comparative prior periods. The company adopted
this EITF as required in 2002 and the adoption of this statement had no impact
on the company net earnings, financial position or cash flows, but did result
in a reclassification of certain prior year reported amounts to conform to the
current year presentation. Both revenue and selling, general and
administrative expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2001 were
reduced by approximately $385 million, as a result of this reclassification.
38 General
The company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is probable. The following are the policies applicable to
Lexmark major categories of revenue transactions Products
Revenue from product sales, including sales to distributors and resellers, is
recognized when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer, generally when
the product is shipped to the customer. When other significant obligations
remain after products are delivered, revenue is recognized only after such
obligations are fulfilled. At the time revenue is recognized, the company
provides for the estimated cost of post-sales support, principally product
warranty, and reduces revenue for estimated product returns. Additionally, the
company records estimated reductions to revenue at the time of sale for customer
programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements,
promotions and other volume-based incentives. Estimated reductions in revenue
are based upon historical trends and other known factors at the time of sale. In
addition, the company provides price protection to substantially all of its
reseller customers. The company records reductions to revenue for the estimated
impact of price protection when price reductions to resellers are anticipated.
Services
Revenue from support or maintenance contracts, including extended warranty
programs, is recognized ratably over the contractual period. Amounts invoiced to
customers in excess of revenue recognized on support or maintenance contracts
are recorded as deferred revenue until the appropriate revenue recognition
criteria are met. Revenue for time and material contracts is recognized as the
services are performed.
Multiple Element Revenue Arrangements
The company enters into transactions that include multiple elements, such as a
combination of products and services. Revenue for these arrangements is
allocated to each element based on its relative fair value and is recognized
when the revenue recognition criteria for each element have been met. Relative
fair value may be determined by the price of an element if it were sold on a
stand-alone basis referred to as vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE.
In the absence of VSOE, third party evidence competitors' prices of comparable
products or services is used to determine relative fair value.
Advertising Costs The company expenses advertising costs when incurred. Advertising expense was
approximately $807 million, $762 million and $781 million in 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively.
Pension and Postretirement Benefits The company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans and its non-pension
postretirement benefit plans using actuarial models required by SFAS No. 87,
Employers' Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, respectively. Liabilities are
computed using the projected unit credit method. The objective under this method
is to expense each participant benefits under the plan as they accrue, taking
into consideration future salary increases and the plan benefit allocation
formula. Thus, the total pension to which each participant is expected to become
entitled is broken down into units, each associated with a year of past or
future credited service.
39 The discount rate assumption for the pension and postretirement benefit plans
reflects the rates available on high-quality fixed-income investments at
December 31 each year. The company assumed long-term rate of return on plan
assets is based on long-term historical actual return information, the mix of
investments that comprise plan assets and future estimates of long-term
investment returns by reference to external sources. Differences between actual
and expected asset returns are recognized in the market-related value of plan
assets over five years. The rate of compensation increase is determined by the
company based upon its long-term plans for such increases. The company funding
policy for its pension plans is to fund minimum amounts according to the
regulatory requirements under which the plans operate. From time to time, the
company may choose to fund amounts in excess of the minimum for various reasons.
The company accrues for the cost of providing postretirement benefits such as
medical and life insurance coverage over the active service period of the
employee. These benefits are funded by the company when paid.
Stock-Based Compensation In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation -- Transition and Disclosure -- an Amendment of SFAS 123, which
provides alternative methods for a voluntary change to the fair value method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and amends the disclosure
requirements of SFAS 123. The company has elected to continue to account for its
stock-based employee compensation plans under APB Opinion 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. The following
disclosures are provided in accordance with SFAS 148.
The company has various stock-based employee compensation plans, which are
described in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. No
stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net earnings as all
options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market
value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The following table
illustrates the effect on net earnings and earnings per share if the company had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation.                                YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31

-  Income Taxes The provision for income taxes is computed based on pre-tax income included in
the statements of earnings. The company recognizes deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference
40 between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
differences are expected to reverse.
Derivatives The company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and SFAS No. 138,
Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities,
which amended certain portions of SFAS 133. These statements require that all
derivatives, including foreign currency exchange contracts, be recognized in the
statement of financial position at their fair value. Derivatives that are not
hedges must be recorded at fair value through earnings. If a derivative is a
hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the
derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of underlying
assets or liabilities through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive
earnings until the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any
ineffective portion of a derivative change in fair value is immediately
recognized in earnings.
Net Earnings Per Share Basic net earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the reported period. The
calculation of diluted net earnings per share is similar to basic, except that
the weighted average number of shares outstanding includes the additional
dilution from potential common stock such as stock options and stock under
long-term incentive plans.
Other Comprehensive Earnings Loss Other comprehensive earnings loss refers to revenues, expenses, gains and
losses that under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America are included in comprehensive earnings loss but are excluded from
net income as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to
stockholders' equity, net of tax. The company other comprehensive earnings
loss is composed of deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges, foreign
currency translation adjustments and adjustments made to recognize additional
minimum liabilities associated with the company defined benefit pension plans.
Segment Data The company manufactures and sells a variety of printing products and related
supplies and services. The company is primarily managed along business and
consumer market segments. Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company
reportable segments.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51. FIN 46 requires certain variable
interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if
the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a
controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the
entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial
support from other parties. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46-R,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51
revised December 2003, which replaces FIN 46. FIN 46-R incorporates certain
modifications to FIN 46 adopted by the FASB subsequent to the issuance of FIN
46, including modifications to the scope of FIN 46. Additionally, FIN 46-R also
incorporates much of the guidance previously issued in the form of FASB Staff
Positions. For all special purpose entities SPEs created prior to February
1, 2003, public entities must apply either the provisions of FIN 46 or early
adopt the provisions of FIN 46-R at the end of the first interim or
41 annual reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. The company has
evaluated the provisions of this interpretation and determined that the
interpretation has no impact on its financial position, results of operations
and cash flows.
In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement No. 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 149 amends and clarifies
financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities
under SFAS 133. SFAS 149 is generally effective for contracts entered into or
modified after June 30, 2003. The company has evaluated the provisions of this
statement and determined that this statement has no impact on the company
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 revised 2003, Employers'
Disclosures about Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. This Statement
revises employers' disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement
benefit plans. It does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans
required by SFAS 87, SFAS No. 88, Employers' Accounting for Settlements and
Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, and
SFAS 106. This Statement retains the disclosure requirements contained in SFAS
132, which it replaces. It requires additional disclosures to those in the
original SFAS 132 about the assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic
benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit
postretirement plans. The new rules also require additional disclosures in
interim financial statements about the amount of net periodic benefit cost
recognized and the amount of contributions paid or to be paid to a plan if
significantly different from amounts previously reported. The disclosures are
required to be provided separately for pension plans and for other
postretirement benefit plans. The newly required annual disclosures are included
in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The interim
disclosures are required for quarters beginning after December 15, 2003.
In December 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued SAB 104, Revenue
Recognition, which superceded SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements. SAB 104 updated certain interpretive guidance included in SAB 101,
including the SAB 101 guidance related to multiple element revenue arrangements,
to reflect the issuance of EITF 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables. The basic revenue recognition principles of SAB 101 were
largely unchanged by the issuance of SAB 104, and therefore, did not have a
material impact on the company financial position, results of operations and
cash flows.
In January 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP No. FAS 106-1,
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. FSP 106-1 permits employers who
sponsor postretirement benefit plans plan sponsors that provide prescription
drug benefits to retirees to make a one-time election to defer accounting for
any effects of the Medicare, Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization
Act of 2003 the Act. Without FSP 106-1, plan sponsors would be required
under SFAS 106 to account for the effects of the Act in the fiscal period that
includes December 8, 2003, the date the President signed the Act into law. For
example, a calendar year plan sponsor would be required to account for the Act
for the first time in its 2003 year-end financial statements if it uses a
year-end measurement date, or in its financial statements for the first quarter
of calendar 2004 if it uses a September 30 measurement date. If deferral is
elected, the deferral must remain in effect until the earlier of a the
issuance of guidance by the FASB on how to account for the federal subsidy to be
provided to plan sponsors under the Act or b the remeasurement of plan assets
and obligations subsequent to January 31, 2004. The company has elected to defer
accounting for the effects of the Act.
42 Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified, if applicable, to conform to
the 2003 presentation.
3. MARKETABLE SECURITIES
During September 2003, the company began investing in marketable securities. The
company evaluated its marketable securities in accordance with SFAS No. 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and determined
that all of its investments in marketable securities to date should be
classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value, with unrealized
gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive earnings loss. The fair value
of the company available-for-sale marketable securities approximates the
company amortized cost. As of December 31, 2003, there were no realized or
unrealized gains or losses related to marketable securities. The company expects
to use the specific identification method when accounting for the costs of its
available-for-sale marketable securities as sold.
At December 31, 2003, the company available-for-sale marketable securities
consisted of the following                               GROSS    GROSS

-  Although contractual maturities of the company debt securities are generally
greater than one year, the investments are classified as current assets in the
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position due to the company expected
holding period of less than one year. The contractual maturities of the
company available-for-sale marketable debt securities noted above were as

-  4. RECEIVABLES
The company trade receivables are reported in the Consolidated Statements of
Financial Position net of allowances for doubtful accounts and product returns.
In the U.S., the company sells its receivables to its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Lexmark Receivables Corporation LRC, which then sells the receivables to an
unrelated third party. The financial results of LRC are included in the
company consolidated financial results. LRC is a separate legal entity with
its own separate creditors who, in a liquidation of LRC, would be entitled to be
satisfied out of LRC assets prior to any value in LRC becoming available for
equity claims of the company. The company accounts for the transfers of
receivables as sales transactions.
In October 2001, the company entered into an agreement to sell its U.S. trade
receivables on a limited recourse basis that allowed for a maximum amount of
financing availability of $2250 million. In October 2003, the agreement was
amended and the maximum amount of U.S.
43 trade receivables to be sold was decreased to $2000 million. As collections
reduce previously sold receivables, the company may replenish these with new
receivables. The company bears a limited risk of bad debt losses on U.S. trade
receivables sold, since the company over-collateralizes the receivables sold
with additional eligible receivables. The company addresses this risk of loss in
its allowance for doubtful accounts. Receivables sold may not include amounts
over 90 days past due or concentrations over certain limits with any one
customer. This facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as
well as specific provisions related to the quality of the accounts receivables
sold. The facility expires in October 2004, and required annual renewal of
commitments in October 2002 and 2003. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the
facility had no U.S. trade receivables sold and outstanding.
Expenses incurred under this program totaling $03 million, $13 million, and
$71 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, are included on the other
expense line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

-  Depreciation expense was $1481 million, $1375 million and $1253 million for
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
During the third quarter of 2002, the company recorded an asset impairment
write-off of approximately $158 million related to the abandonment of a
customer relationship management software project which had encountered software
implementation and integration issues. The project was never implemented and,
after it was determined that it would not meet the company needs, it was
abandoned and the in-process capital was written off. The third quarter asset
impairment write-off was determined in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, and was included on the
cost of revenue line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The fair value
of the asset was determined to be zero, since it was customized for the company
and therefore, had no commercial value.
44 7. ACCRUED LIABILITIES
Accrued liabilities consisted of the following at December 31                                2003   2002

8. DEBT
The company has outstanding $1500 million principal amount of 675% senior
notes due May 15, 2008, which was initially priced at 98998%, to yield 689% to
maturity. A balance of $1493 million net of unamortized discount of $07
million was outstanding at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2002, the balance
was $1492 million net of unamortized discount of $08 million. The senior
notes contain typical restrictions on liens, sale leaseback transactions,
mergers and sales of assets. There are no sinking fund requirements on the
senior notes and they may be redeemed at any time at the option of the company,
at a redemption price as described in the related indenture agreement, as
supplemented and amended, in whole or in part.
During October 2003, the company entered into interest rate swap contracts to
convert its $1500 million principal amount of 675% senior notes from a fixed
interest rate to a variable interest rate. Interest rate swaps with a notional
amount of $1500 million were executed whereby the company will receive interest
at a fixed rate of 675% and pay interest at a variable rate of approximately
276% above the six-month London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR. These
interest rate swaps have a maturity date of May 15, 2008, which is equivalent to
the maturity date of the senior notes.
45 Effective May 29, 2002, the company entered into a new $500 million unsecured,
revolving credit facility with a group of banks, including a $200 million
364-day portion and a $300 million 3-year portion. Upon entering into the new
credit agreement, the company terminated the prior $300 million unsecured,
revolving credit facility that was due to expire on January 27, 2003. There were
no amounts outstanding under the prior facility upon its termination.
Under the credit facility, the company may borrow in dollars, euros and certain
other currencies. The interest rate ranges from 035% to 125% above the LIBOR
for borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars, the Eurocurrency Interbank Offered
Rate EURIBOR for borrowings denominated in euros, or other relevant
international interest rate for borrowings denominated in another currency. The
interest rate spread is based upon the company debt ratings. In addition, the
company is required to pay a facility fee on the $500 million line of credit of
0075% to 025% based upon the company debt ratings. The interest and facility
fees are payable quarterly.
The credit agreement contains customary default provisions, leverage and
interest coverage restrictions and certain restrictions on secured and
subsidiary debt, disposition of assets, liens and mergers and acquisitions. The
364-day portion of the $500 million credit facility had a maturity date of May
28, 2003. During May 2003, each lender approved the extension of the $200
million 364-day portion of the revolving credit facility with a new maturity
date of May 26, 2004. The 3-year portion of the credit facility has a maturity
date of May 29, 2005. Any amounts outstanding under the credit facility are due
according to the applicable maturity dates noted above. As of December 31, 2003
and 2002, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility.
The company Brazilian operation has a short-term, uncommitted line of credit
with an outstanding balance of $11 million and $93 million at December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. The interest rate on this line of credit varies
based upon the local prevailing interest rates at the time of borrowing, and
averaged approximately 25% and 19%, during 2003 and 2002, respectively.
During 2002, the company operation in the People Republic of China entered
into a short-term, uncommitted revolving loan facility. As of December 31, 2003,
there were no amounts outstanding under this facility and as of December 31,
2002, a balance of $30 million was outstanding under this facility. The
interest rate on this facility varies based upon the local prevailing interest
rates at the time of borrowing. While no amounts were outstanding under this
facility at December 31, 2003, it was utilized during 2003 and the interest rate
averaged approximately 5% during 2003 and 2002.
In February 2001, the company filed a shelf registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to register $200 million of debt securities.
Due to the company strong cash position, in early 2004 the company determined
that it did not plan to utilize the shelf registration, and on January 28, 2004,
withdrew its registration pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
Total cash paid for interest amounted to $111 million, $126 million and $143
million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
The components of interest income/expense, net in the Consolidated Statements
of Earnings were as follows                                2003  2002  2001
- 
Interest  $129 $36 $17

- 
$ 04 $ 90  $148
-                      46 9. INCOME TAXES
The provision for income taxes consisted of the following                                2003   2002   2001
- 
Current:

-  Earnings before income taxes were as follows                                2003   2002   2001
- 
U.S.  $3086  $2753  $1686
Non-U.S.   2849  2203  1492
- 
Earnings before income  $5935  $4956  $3178
-  The company realized an income tax benefit from the exercise of certain stock
options in 2003, 2002 and 2001 of $372 million, $313 million and $547
million, respectively. This benefit resulted in a decrease in current income
taxes payable and an increase in capital in excess of par.
In 2001, the company reached resolution with the Internal Revenue Service
IRS on certain adjustments related to the intercompany allocation of
profits. As a result of this resolution, the company reversed previously accrued
taxes, reducing the tax provision in the fourth quarter of 2001 by $400 million
or $030 per share.
47 Significant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities at
December 31 were as follows                                2003   2002

- 
Net deferred tax  $ 541  $1306
-  The company has non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards of $30 million, which have an
indefinite carryforward period.
Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries. Undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries included
in the consolidated retained earnings were approximately $8432 million. The
company does not plan to initiate any action that would precipitate the payment
of income taxes. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax
that may be payable on the foreign earnings.
The IRS has completed its examination of the company income tax returns for
all years through 1996. As of December 31, 2003, the IRS was in the process of
examining the company income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2001.
Additionally, the company and its subsidiaries are subject to tax examinations
in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The company believes that adequate
amounts of taxes and related interest have been provided for any adjustments
that may result from these examinations.
A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes using the U.S. statutory rate
and the company effective tax rate was as follows                       2003       2002       2001

10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
The Class A common stock is voting and exchangeable for Class B common stock in
very limited circumstances. The Class B common stock is non-voting and is
convertible, subject to certain limitations, into Class A common stock.
At December 31, 2003, approximately 7127 million and 18 million shares of
Class A and Class B common stock were unissued and unreserved. These shares are
available for a variety of general corporate purposes, including future public
offerings to raise additional capital and for facilitating acquisitions.
In July 2002, the company received authorization from the board of directors to
repurchase an additional $200 million of its Class A common stock for a total
repurchase authority of $14 billion. At December 31, 2003, there was
approximately $183 million of share repurchase authority remaining. This
repurchase authority allows the company, at management discretion, to
selectively repurchase its stock from time to time in the open market or in
privately negotiated transactions depending upon market price and other factors.
During 2003, the company repurchased approximately 01 million shares in the
open market at prices ranging from $7151 per share to $7430 per share for a
cost of approximately $5 million. As of December 31, 2003, the company had
repurchased approximately 348 million shares at prices ranging from $1063 per
share to $10538 per share for an aggregate cost of approximately $12 billion.
As of December 31, 2003, the company had reissued 03 million shares of
previously repurchased shares in connection with certain of its employee benefit
programs. As a result of these issuances, the net treasury shares outstanding at
December 31, 2003 were 345 million.
In 1998, the company board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan the
Rights Plan which provides existing stockholders with the right to purchase
one one-thousandth 0001 of a share of Series A Junior Participating preferred
stock for each share of Class A and Class B common stock held in the event of
certain changes in the company ownership. The rights will expire on January
31, 2009, unless earlier redeemed by the company.

-  Stock options to purchase 14 million common shares in 2003, 21 million common
shares in 2002, and 19 million common shares in 2001 were outstanding, but were
not included in the
49 computation of diluted net earnings per share because the options' exercise
prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares and,
therefore, the effect would have been antidilutive.
12. STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS
The company has various stock incentive plans to encourage employees and
nonemployee directors to remain with the company and to more closely align their
interests with those of the company stockholders. Under the employee plans, as
of December 31, 2003 approximately 87 million shares of Class A common stock
are reserved for future grants in the form of stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock, performance shares or deferred stock units of which
up to 31 million shares can be used for restricted stock, performance shares
and deferred stock units. Under the nonemployee director plan, as of December
31, 2003 approximately 02 million shares of Class A common stock are reserved
for future grants in the form of stock options and deferred stock units. As of
December 31, 2003, awards under the programs have been limited to stock options,
restricted stock, performance shares and deferred stock units.
The exercise price of options awarded under stock option plans is equal to the
fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Generally
options expire ten years from the date of grant and generally become fully
vested at the end of five years based upon continued employment or the
completion of three years of service on the board of directors. In some cases,
option vesting and exercisability may be accelerated due to the achievement of
performance objectives.
The company applies APB Opinion 25, and related interpretations in accounting
for its plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for its
stock-based compensation plans other than for restricted stock,
performance-based awards and deferred stock units. Refer to significant
accounting policies -- stock-based compensation in Note 2 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for the effects on net earnings and earnings
per share had the company applied the fair value methodology prescribed under
SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2003, 2002 and 2001
was $2594, $2414 and $2302 per share, respectively.
The fair value of each option grant on the grant date was estimated using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions                                2003  2002  2001

-  As of December 31, 2003, the company had granted approximately 500,000
restricted stock units and supplemental deferred stock units with various
vesting periods. During 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively, the company granted
50,000, 29,000 and 140,000 restricted stock units and supplemental deferred
stock units with weighted average grant prices of $6078, $5202 and $4998. As
of December 31, 2003, there were approximately 246,000 restricted stock units
and supplemental deferred stock units outstanding. The cost of the awards,
determined to be the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant, is
charged to compensation expense ratably over the vesting periods.
The company has also issued approximately 337,000 deferred stock units to
certain members of management who have elected to defer all or a portion of
their annual bonus into such units and to certain nonemployee directors who
elected to defer all or a portion of their annual retainer, chair retainer
and/or meeting fees into such units. These deferred stock units are 100% vested
at
51 all times. As of December 31, 2003, there were approximately 203,000 such
deferred stock units outstanding.
In addition, the company awarded approximately 134,000 performance shares, the
vesting of which was based on the attainment of certain performance goals by the
end of the four year period 1997 through 2000. Based on the certification in
early 2001 that such performance goals were satisfied, the shares were fully
vested but receipt of these shares was deferred by the grantees. In January
2003, 113,000 of these shares were issued and 21,000 shares were further
deferred until February 2005. The compensation expense in connection with the
performance shares was estimated over the four year period based on the fair
market value of the shares during that period. In order to mitigate the impact
of stock price changes on compensation expense, the company entered into a
forward equity contract on its common stock during 2000 which was settled in
cash in 2001.
The company recorded compensation expense of $21 million, $30 million and $44
million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to these stock incentive
plans.
The company also has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP which enables
substantially all regular employees to purchase full or fractional shares of
Lexmark Class A common stock through payroll deductions of up to 10% of eligible
compensation. Effective July 1, 2002, the ESPP was amended whereby the share
price paid by an employee changed from 85% of the closing market price on the
last business day of each month, to 85% of the lesser of the closing market
price on i the last business day immediately preceding the first day of the
respective offering period and ii the last business day of the respective
offering period. The current plan provides semi-annual offering periods
beginning each January 1 and July 1. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, employees paid
the company $79 million, $45 million and $82 million, respectively, to
purchase approximately 02 million shares, 01 million shares and 02 million
shares, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, there were approximately 24
million shares of Class A common stock reserved for future purchase under the
ESPP.
52 13. EMPLOYEE PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS
The company and its subsidiaries have defined benefit and defined contribution
pension plans that cover a majority of its regular employees, and a supplemental
plan that covers certain executives. Medical, dental and life insurance plans
for retirees are provided by the company and certain of its non-U.S.
subsidiaries. Plan assets are invested in equity securities, government and
agency securities, corporate debt and annuity contracts.
The non-U.S. pension plans are not significant and use economic assumptions
similar to the U.S. pension plan and therefore are not shown separately in the
following disclosures. The changes in the defined benefit plan obligations and
plan assets for 2003 and 2002 were as follows                                        OTHER

-  During 2003 and 2002, the company contributed $1085 million and $500 million,
respectively, to its U.S. pension plan. These contributions were made to improve
the funding status of the plan following the negative returns in the capital
markets over the past few years, which decreased the value of the pension plan
assets. In 2004, the company expects to contribute approximately $450 million
to its pension and postretirement plans, primarily for its European pension
plans.
For measurement purposes, a 100% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost
of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2004. The rate is assumed to
decrease gradually to 525% in 2012 and remain at that level thereafter. Since
the net employer costs for postretirement medical benefits reach the preset caps
within the next two to four years, a 1% increase or decrease in trend has a de
minimis effect on costs.
Related to the company acquisition of the Information Products Corporation
from IBM in 1991, IBM agreed to pay for its pro rata share currently estimated
at $729 million of future
54 postretirement benefits for all the company U.S. employees based on pro rated
years of service with IBM and the company.
A significant portion of the retirement plan assets and liabilities relating to
its defined benefit plans are derived from the company U.S. defined benefit
plan. The investment goal of the U.S. defined benefit plan is to achieve an
adequate net investment return in order to provide for future benefit payments
to its participants. The target asset allocation percentages approved by the
company board of directors are 75% equity securities and 25% fixed income
securities. The plan currently employs professional investment managers to
invest in two assets classes: U.S. equity and U.S. fixed income. Each investment
manager operates under an investment management contract that includes specific
investment guidelines, requiring among other actions, adequate diversification,
prudent use of derivatives and standard risk management practices such as
portfolio constraints relating to established benchmarks. The plan currently
uses a combination of both active management and passive index funds to achieve
its investment goals.
The company U.S. pension plan weighted-average asset allocations at December
31, 2003 and 2002, by asset category were as follows                                2003   2002

countries. Company contributions are based upon a percentage of employees'
contributions. The company expense under these plans was $128 million, $114
million, and $100 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
14. DERIVATIVES, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The company activities expose it to a variety of market risks, including the
effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The
company risk management program seeks to reduce the potentially adverse
effects that market risks may have on its operating results.
The company maintains a foreign currency risk management strategy that uses
derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations
in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. The
company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes nor
does it hold or issue leveraged derivative instruments. The company maintains an
interest rate risk management strategy that may, from time to time use
derivative instruments to minimize significant, unanticipated earnings
fluctuations caused by interest rate volatility. By using derivative financial
instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and interest rates,
the company exposes itself to credit risk and market risk. The company manages
exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative financial
instruments with highly rated institutions that can be expected to fully perform
under the terms of the agreement. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value
of a financial instrument that results from a change in currency exchange rates
or interest rates. The company manages exposure to market risk associated with
interest rate and foreign exchange contracts by establishing and monitoring
parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be
undertaken.
55 The company uses the following hedging strategies to reduce the potentially
adverse effects that market volatility may have on its operating results Fair Value Hedges: Fair value hedges are hedges of recognized assets or
liabilities. The company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge actual
purchases and sales of inventories. The forward contracts used in this program
mature in three months or less, consistent with the related purchase and sale
commitments. Foreign exchange option contracts, as well as forward contracts,
may be used as fair value hedges in situations where derivative instruments, for
which hedge accounting has been discontinued, expose earnings to further change
in exchange rates. The company is using interest rate swaps to convert a portion
of its fixed rate financing activities to variable rates.
Cash Flow Hedges: Cash flow hedges are hedges of forecasted transactions or of
the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized
asset or liability. The company enters into foreign exchange options and forward
exchange contracts expiring within eighteen months as hedges of anticipated
purchases and sales that are denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts
are entered into to protect against the risk that the eventual cash flows
resulting from such transactions will be adversely affected by changes in
exchange rates. The company also enters into currency swap contracts to hedge
foreign currency risks that result from the transfer of various currencies
within the company. The currency swap contracts entered into generally expire
within one month.
ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
All derivatives are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial
Position at their fair value. Fair values for the company derivative financial
instruments are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments or, if
none are available, on pricing models or formulas using current assumptions. On
the date the derivative contract is entered into, the company designates the
derivative as either a fair value or cash flow hedge. Changes in the fair value
of a derivative that is highly effective as -- and that is designated and
qualifies as -- a fair value hedge, along with the loss or gain on the hedged
asset or liability are recorded in current period earnings in cost of revenues.
Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as -- and
that is designated and qualifies as -- a cash flow hedge are recorded in other
comprehensive earnings, until the underlying transactions occur.
At December 31, 2003, the company had derivative assets of $81 million
classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets as well as derivative
liabilities of $500 million classified as accrued liabilities. At December 31,
2002, the company had derivative assets of $409 million classified as prepaid
expenses and other current assets as well as derivative liabilities of $574
million classified as accrued liabilities. As of December 31, 2003, a total of
$365 million of deferred net losses on derivative instruments were accumulated
in other comprehensive earnings loss, of which $353 million is expected to be
reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2002,
a total of $209 million of deferred net losses on derivative instruments were
accumulated in other comprehensive earnings loss, of which $199 million was
reclassified to earnings during 2003.
The company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and
hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for
undertaking various hedge items. This process includes linking all derivatives
that are designated as fair value and cash flow to specific assets and
liabilities on the balance sheet or to forecasted transactions. The company also
formally assesses, both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis,
whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly
effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items.
When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or
that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the company discontinues
hedge accounting prospectively, as discussed below.
56 The company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when 1 it is
determined that a derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the
fair value or cash flows of a hedged item; 2 the derivative expires or is
sold, terminated, or exercised or 3 the derivative is discontinued as a hedge
instrument, because it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur.
When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the
derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value hedge, the derivative
will continue to be carried in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position
at its fair value. When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable
that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the derivative will continue to be
carried in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at its fair value,
and gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive earnings are
recognized immediately in earnings. In all other situations in which hedge
accounting is discontinued, the derivative will be carried at its fair value in
the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, with changes in its fair
value recognized in current period earnings. A fair value hedge is entered into
when the derivative instrument, for which hedge accounting has been
discontinued, exposes earnings to further change in exchange rates. An
immaterial portion of the company cash flow hedges was determined to be
ineffective as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 because it was unlikely that the
forecasted transactions would occur. During 2003, an immaterial loss was
reclassified to current period earnings and during 2002, an immaterial gain was
reclassified to current period earnings.
The company recorded $104 million, $130 million and $70 million of aggregate
foreign currency transaction losses in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
aggregate foreign currency transaction loss amounts include the gains/losses of
the company foreign currency fair value hedges for all periods presented.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
At December 31, 2003, the carrying value of the company long-term debt was
$1493 million and the fair value was $1669 million. At December 31, 2002, the
carrying value of the company long-term debt was $1492 million and the fair
value was $1630 million. The fair value of the long-term debt was estimated
based on current rates available to the company for debt with similar
characteristics. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the carrying value of the
company short-term debt was $11 and $123 million, respectively, which
approximated the fair value.
During October 2003, the company entered into interest rate swap contracts to
convert its $1500 million principal amount of 675% senior notes from a fixed
interest rate to a variable interest rate. The interest rate swaps are
designated as a fair value hedge of the company $1500 million long-term debt.
The interest rate swaps are recorded at their fair value and the company
long-term debt is adjusted by the same corresponding value in accordance with
the short-cut method of SFAS 133. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is
combined with the fair value adjustment of the company long-term debt due to
immateriality and is presented on the long-term debt line in the company
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. At December 31, 2003, the fair
value of the interest rate swap contracts was $04 million.
CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK
The company main concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary
cash investments, marketable securities and trade receivables. Cash and
marketable securities investments are made in a variety of high quality
securities with prudent diversification requirements. Credit risk related to
trade receivables is dispersed across a large number of customers located in
various geographic areas. The company sells a large portion of its products
through third-party distributors and resellers and original equipment
manufacturer OEM customers. If the financial condition or operations of
these distributors, resellers and OEM customers were to deteriorate
substantially, the company operating results could be adversely affected. The
three largest distributor, reseller and OEM customer trade receivable balances
57 collectively represented approximately 29% of total trade receivables at
December 31, 2003 and approximately 20% at December 31, 2002. However, the
company performs ongoing credit evaluations of the financial position of its
third-party distributors, resellers and other customers to determine appropriate
credit limits. Collateral such as letters of credit and bank guarantees is
required in certain circumstances.
The company generally has experienced longer accounts receivable cycles in its
emerging markets, in particular, Asia Pacific and Latin America, when compared
to its U.S. and European markets. In the event that accounts receivable cycles
in these developing markets lengthen further, the company could be adversely
affected.
The company also procures a wide variety of components used in the manufacturing
process. Although many of these components are available from multiple sources,
the company often utilizes preferred supplier relationships to better ensure
more consistent quality, cost and delivery. The company also sources some
printer engines and finished products from OEMs. Typically, these preferred
suppliers maintain alternate processes and/or facilities to ensure continuity of
supply. Although the company plans in anticipation of its future requirements,
should these components not be available from any one of these suppliers, there
can be no assurance that production of certain of the company products would
not be disrupted.
15. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES
As of December 31, 2002, the company had substantially completed all
restructuring activities and, therefore, reversed approximately $59 million
$44 million, net of tax during the fourth quarter of 2002. The reversal was
primarily due to lower severance costs approximately $35 million and lower
other exit costs approximately $24 million. The severance payments were lower
than originally estimated due to higher than expected attrition which resulted
in the company being able to achieve headcount reductions at a lower cost.
Although the restructuring activities were substantially complete at year-end
2002 and the employees exited the business, approximately $47 million of
severance payments were paid during 2003.
The following table presents a rollforward of the liabilities in millions
incurred in connection with the 2001 and prior restructuring plans. These
liabilities were reflected as accrued liabilities in the company Consolidated
Statements of Financial Position.                               EMPLOYEE   OTHER EXIT

December 31,   $  --    $ --   $    During the fourth quarter of 2001, Lexmark management and board of directors
approved a restructuring plan the 2001 restructuring that included a
reduction in the company global
58 workforce of up to 12 percent. This plan provided for a reduction in
infrastructure and overhead expenses, the elimination of the company business
class inkjet printer, and the closure of an electronic card manufacturing
facility in Reynosa, Mexico. Restructuring and related charges of $584 million
$429 million, net of tax were expensed during the fourth quarter of 2001.
These charges were comprised of $360 million of accrued restructuring costs
related to separation and other exit costs, $114 million associated with a
pension curtailment related to the employee separations and $110 million
related to asset impairment charges. The company also recorded $293 million
$216 million, net of tax of associated restructuring-related inventory
write-offs resulting from the company decision to eliminate its business class
inkjet printer, to limit the period over which the company will provide
replacement parts for products no longer in production, and to exit the
electronic card manufacturing facility. The inventory write-offs were included
on the cost of revenue line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
The accrued restructuring costs for employee separations of $263 million were
associated with approximately 1,600 employees worldwide from various business
functions and job classes. Employee separation benefits included severance,
medical and other benefits. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 1,225
employees exited the business under the 2001 restructuring plan. This total
included the employees discussed below who were transferred to another company.
In addition to employees exiting the business under the restructuring plan, the
company headcount was further decreased due to higher than expected attrition.
The other exit costs of $97 million were primarily related to vendor and lease
cancellation charges.
The $110 million charge for asset impairment in 2001 was determined in
accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, and resulted from the company
decision to abandon certain assets consisting primarily of machinery and
equipment used to manufacture business class inkjet printers and electronic
cards. The charge for asset impairments was included on the restructuring and
related charges line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
In connection with the company plans to exit the electronic card manufacturing
facility in Reynosa, Mexico, Lexmark sold the Reynosa operation to
Manufacturers' Services Limited MSL in early July 2002. Approximately 250
Reynosa employees were transferred to MSL as part of the sale transaction and
those employees were expected to be retained by MSL. In accordance with the
sales agreement, the company prepaid eighteen months of the building lease and
agreed to provide support payments to MSL for approximately eighteen months,
subject to the terms of the agreement. MSL agreed to assume the building lease
payments for the remainder of the lease term. During the third quarter of 2002,
the company reversed excess reserves of approximately $54 million for lease
cancellation charges and employee separation costs, which were not incurred as a
result of the sale to MSL. The company recorded a charge for approximately the
same amount related to the support agreement with MSL.
16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The company is committed under operating leases containing various renewal
options for rental of office and manufacturing space and equipment. Rent
expense net of rental income of $21 million, $20 million and $20 million
was $451 million, $414 million, and $422 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Future minimum rentals under terms of non-cancelable operating
leases at December 31 are: 2004-$330 million; 2005-$282 million; 2006-$224
million; 2007-$155 million; 2008-$127 million and thereafter-$207 million.
The company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the
ordinary course of business. The company does not believe that the outcome of
any of those matters will have a material adverse effect on the company
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

62 MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The consolidated financial statements and related information included in this
Financial Report are the responsibility of management and have been reported in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. All other financial data in this Annual Report have been presented on a
basis consistent with the information included in the consolidated financial
statements. Lexmark International, Inc. maintains a system of financial controls
and procedures, which includes the work of corporate auditors, which we believe
provides reasonable assurance that the financial records are reliable in all
material respects for preparing the consolidated financial statements and
maintaining accountability for assets. The concept of reasonable assurance is
based on the recognition that the cost of a system of financial controls must be
related to the benefits derived and that the balancing of those factors requires
estimates and judgment. This system of financial controls is reviewed, modified
and improved as changes occur in business conditions and operations, and as a
result of suggestions from the corporate auditors and PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP.
The Finance and Audit Committee, composed of outside members of the Board of
Directors, meets periodically with management, the independent accountants and
the corporate auditors, for the purpose of monitoring their activities to ensure
that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. The Finance and Audit
Committee, independent accountants, and corporate auditors have free access to
one another to discuss their findings. s/ Paul J. Curlander

subsidiaries the company at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the company management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
