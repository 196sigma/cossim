To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
DXP Enterprises, Inc., and Subsidiaries
Houston, Texas
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of DXP Enterprises, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company has determined that it is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of DXP Enterprises, Inc., and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. s/ HEIN ASSOCIATES LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES DXP Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries DXP or the Company, a Texas corporation, was incorporated on July 26, 1996, to be the successor to SEPCO Industries, Inc. SEPCO. The Company is organized into two segments: Maintenance, Repair and Operating MRO and Electrical Contracting. See Note 11 for discussion of the business segments.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Receivables and Credit Risk
Trade receivables consist primarily of uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms, which usually require payment within 30 days of the invoice date. However, these payment terms are extended in select cases and many customers do not pay within stated trade terms. Payments on trade receivables are applied as indicated by customer, or to the earliest unpaid invoices.
The Company has trade receivables from a diversified customer base in the rocky mountain, southeastern and southwestern regions of the United States. The Company believes no significant concentration of credit risk exists. The Company evaluates the creditworthiness of its customers' financial positions and monitors accounts on a regular basis, but generally does not require collateral. Provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made monthly and adjustments are made periodically as circumstances warrant based upon management best estimate of the collectibility of all such accounts. No customer represents more than 10% of consolidated sales.
Inventories
Inventories consist principally of finished goods and are priced at lower of cost or market, cost being determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO and the last-in, first-out LIFO method. Reserves are provided against inventories for estimated obsolescence based upon the aging of the inventories and market trends.
Property and Equipment
Assets are carried on the basis of cost. Provisions for depreciation are computed at rates considered to be sufficient to amortize the costs of assets over their expected useful lives. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method. Maintenance and repairs of depreciable assets are charged against earnings as incurred. Additions and improvements are capitalized. When properties are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and gains or losses are credited or charged to earnings.
The principal estimated useful lives used in determining depreciation are as follows Buildings20 - 39 years
Building improvements10 - 20 years
Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 - 10 years
Leasehold improvementsover the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the related lease Federal Income Taxes
The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred taxes are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted marginal tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences reverse.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company presentation of cash includes cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are defined as short-term investments with maturity dates of ninety days or less at time of purchase.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
A summary of the carrying and the fair value of financial instruments at December 31, 2003 and 2004, is as follows in thousands 2003 2004 Carrying

18,149 18,149 16,345 16,345 The carrying value of the long-term debt approximates fair value based upon the current rates and terms available to the Company for instruments with similar remaining maturities.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has elected to follow APB No. 25, and related Interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 148 requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options. Under APB No. 25, no compensation expense is recognized if the exercise price of the Company employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. No compensation expense was recognized under APB No. 25 during the three years ended December 31, 2004.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by SFAS No. 148 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its stock options under the fair value method as provided therein. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for options issued in 2002, 2003 and 2004: risk-free interest rates of 39% for 2002, 40% for 2003 and 45% for 2004; expected lives of five to ten years, assumed volatility of 82% for 2002, 80% for 2003, and 78% for 2004; and no expected dividends.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. Set forth below is a summary of the Company net income and earnings per share as reported and pro forma as if the fair value-based method of accounting defined in SFAS No. 148 had been applied. The pro forma compensation expense may not be representative of future amounts because options vest over several years and generally expire upon termination of employment, and additional options may be granted in future years.

Revenues recognized include product sales and billings for freight and handling charges. The Company recognizes product sales and billings for freight and handling charges when an agreement is in place, price is fixed, title for product passes to the customer or services have been provided, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
The Company reserves for potential customer returns based upon the historical level of returns.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The significant estimates made by the Company in the accompanying financial statements relate to the reserves for accounts receivable collectibility, inventory valuations, income taxes and self-insured medical claims. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The Company purchases insurance for catastrophic exposures and those risks required to be insured by law. The Company retains a portion of the risk for medical claims, general liability and property losses. The various deductibles per our insurance policies generally do not exceed $200,000 per occurrence. There are also certain risks for which the Company does not maintain insurance. The Company accrues for the estimated outstanding balance of unpaid medical claims for our employees and their dependents based upon recent claims experience.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income is equal to net income. 2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R will require companies to measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements. In addition, the adoption of SFAS No. 123R requires additional accounting and disclosure related to the income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share-based payment arrangements. SFAS No. 123R is effective beginning as of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is in the process of determining the impact of the requirements of SFAS No. 123R.
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs SFAS 151. This Statement amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material spoilage. SFAS 151 requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges. In addition, this Statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of SFAS 151 are effective for inventory costs incurred in fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We believe that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on the Company financial position and results of operations.
In December 2004, SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets - an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. This Statement addresses the measurement of exchange of nonmonetary assets and eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21b of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. The adoption of SFAS 153 is expected to have no impact on the Company consolidated financial statements.
SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity, was issued in May 2003 and requires issuers to classify as liabilities or assets under certain circumstances three classes of freestanding financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and is otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after December 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material effect on the Company financial statements.
In June 2001, SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets was issued. SFAS No. 142 changes the treatment of goodwill by no longer amortizing goodwill, and instead requiring, at least annually, an assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value based test. However, other identifiable intangible assets are to be separately recognized and amortized. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. All of the Company goodwill pertained to one reporting unit as defined in SFAS 142. The goodwill was tested for impairment during the first quarter of 2002 as required by SFAS 142 upon adoption based upon the expected present value of future cash flows approach. As a result of this valuation process as well as the application of the remaining provisions of SFAS 142, the Company recorded a transitional impairment loss of $25 million before income taxes $17 million after income taxes. This write-off was reported as a cumulative effec
t of a change in accounting principle in the Company consolidated statement of operations as of January 1, 2002. This adoption of the statement has resulted in the elimination of approximately $79,000 of annual goodwill amortization subsequent to December 31, 2001. 3. INVENTORIES The Company uses the LIFO method of inventory valuation for approximately 90 percent of its inventories. Remaining inventories are accounted for using the FIFO method. The reconciliation of FIFO inventory to LIFO basis is as follows December 31, 2003 2004 in Thousands Finished goods 22,324 20,441 Work in process

3,435 3,699 Inventories 19,145 16,995 During 2002, 2003, and 2004 the Company experienced LIFO inventory liquidations. The effect of these liquidations was to increase gross profit by approximately $23,000 in 2002, $39,000 in 2003, and $46,000 in 2004. 4.

1,474 1,420 16,675 14,925 Under the Company loan agreement with its bank lender the Credit Facility, all available cash is generally applied to reduce outstanding borrowings, with operations funded through borrowings under the Credit Facility.  The Credit Facility consists of a secured line of credit with the Company and a secured term loan.
The Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to an aggregate of the lesser of i a percentage of the collateral value based on a formula set forth therein or ii $300 million, matures April 1, 2006, provides the option of interest at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 225% to 325% or prime plus a margin ranging from 00% to 075%. The margin is determined by the ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for a twelve-month period as of the end of the preceding calendar quarter. For the quarter ended December 31, 2004 the prime margin and LIBOR margin were 000% and 225%, respectively, for the revolving portion of the Credit Facility and 025% and 250%, respectively, for the term portion of the Credit Facility. The prime rate averaged, 467%, 412%, and 434% during 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively, and at December 31, 2004, was 525%. At December 31, 2004, $12 million was borrowed at a LIBOR base rate of 244% plus a weighted avera
ge margin of 229%. The Credit Facility is secured by receivables, inventories, real estate and machinery and equipment. The Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as financial covenants that are measured monthly and require the Company to maintain a certain cash flow and other financial ratios. At December 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. In addition to the $23 million of cash at December 31, 2004, the Company had $100 million available for borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2004. Although the Company expects to be able to comply with the covenants, including the financial covenants, of the Credit Facility, there can be no assurance that in the future it will be able to do so or that its lender will be willing to waive such non-compliance or amend such covenants.

In 2004, DXP and DXP vendor of fiberglass reinforced pipe were sued in Louisiana by a major energy company regarding the failure of Bondstrand PSX JFC pipe, a recently introduced type of fiberglass reinforced pipe which had been installed on four energy production platforms. Plaintiff alleges negligence, breach of contract, warranty and that damages exceed $20 million. DXP management believes the failures were caused by the failure of the pipe and not by work performed by DXP. DXP intends to vigorously defend these claims. DXP insurance carrier has agreed, under a reservation of rights to deny coverage, to provide a defense against these claims.
In 2003, the Company was notified that it had been sued in various state courts in Texas. The suits allege personal injury resulting from products containing asbestos allegedly sold by the Company. The suits do not state what products the Company allegedly sold or when the Company allegedly sold the products. Discovery is in the very early stages on these suits. Two of the Company insurance carriers, under a reservation of rights to deny coverage, are paying legal fees for the Company defense against the claims. One of these carriers, while paying the Company asbestos defense costs, has filed a suit asking the courts for a judgment as to whether or not the carrier is liable for the asbestos claims. The Company intends to vigorously defend the Company claim for coverage. If any product sold by the Company is identified through discovery as a product that plaintiffs claim exposure to, it is the Company intent to seek indemnity from the original manufacturer of the produc
t. The Company intends to vigorously defend these claims. The Company does not believe any amount in a judgment or settlement will have a material adverse impact on the Company results of operations and cash flows for a particular period or on the consolidated financial position of the Company.
