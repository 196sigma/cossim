Item 8:  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors 
of Coventry Health Care, Inc.     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Coventry Health Care, Inc. successor in interest to Coventry Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1998. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our 
opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Coventry Health 
Care, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles.

36 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
As of December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996
A.    ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Coventry Health Care, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, the 
Company is a managed health care company that provides comprehensive health
benefits and services to a broad cross section of employer and
government-funded groups in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern United
States. Health care services are provided through a variety of full-risk
health care plans, including health maintenance organization HMO, point of
service POS and preferred provider organization PPO products. 
Additionally, the Company administers self-insured health plans of certain
large employers.
The Company began operations in 1987 with the acquisition of the
American Service Companies ASC entities, including the Coventry Health and
Life Insurance Company CHLIC. In 1988, the Company acquired HealthAmerica
Pennsylvania, Inc. HAPA, a Pennsylvania HMO. In 1990, the Company acquired
Group Health Plan, Inc. GHP, a St. Louis, Missouri HMO. Southern Health
Services, Inc. SHS, a Richmond, Virginia, HMO, was acquired by the Company
in 1994. In 1995, the Company acquired HealthCare USA, Inc. HCUSA, a
Jacksonville, Florida-based Medicaid managed care company. On April 1, 1998,
the Company acquired certain assets of Principal Health Care, Inc. PHC from
Principal Mutual Life Insurance Company, now known as Principal Life Insurance 
Company Principal Life. See Note B to consolidated financial statements.
Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Interests of other investors
in the Company majority owned or otherwise effectively-controlled
subsidiaries are accounted for as minority interests and are included in other
long-term liabilities for financial reporting purposes.
Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist
principally of overnight repurchase agreements, money market funds, commercial
paper and certificates of deposit. The Company considers all highly liquid
securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents reported in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value.
Investments - The Company accounts for investments in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 SFAS 115, Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The Company considers
all of its investments as available-for-sale, and accordingly, records
unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, as a separate
component of stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses on the sale of
these investments are determined on a specific identification basis.
Investments with original maturities in excess of three months and
less than one year are classified as short-term investments and generally
consist of time deposits, U.S. Treasury Notes, and obligations of various
states and municipalities. Long-term investments have original maturities in
excess of one year and primarily consist of debt securities.
Other Receivables - Other receivables include interest receivable,
reinsurance claims receivable, receivables from providers and suppliers and any
other receivables that do not relate to premiums.                    34  37     Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are recorded at cost.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
lives of the related assets or, if shorter, over the terms of the respective
leases.
Long-lived Assets - The Company has adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121 SFAS 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of. In accordance
with SFAS 121, the Company evaluates long-lived assets to be held for events or
changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. In making that determination, the Company considers a number of
factors, including undiscounted future cash flows, prior to interest expense.
The Company measures an impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the
assets to its carrying value. Fair values are determined by using market prices
for similar assets, if available, or discounted future estimated cash flows,
prior to interest expense. Assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of
the carrying amount or fair value, less any cost of disposition.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets - Goodwill and intangible assets consist of costs
in excess of the fair value of the net assets of subsidiaries or operations
acquired. Goodwill is amortized using the straight-line method over periods 
ranging from 15 to 35 years. The remaining unamortized goodwill and intangible
asset balances at December 31, 1998 are as follows in thousands                                 Accumulated

-     Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 was
approximately $136 million, $38 million and $272 million, respectively. In
accordance with SFAS 121 and Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No17,
the Company periodically evaluates the realizability of goodwill and intangible
assets and the reasonableness of the related lives in light of factors such as
industry changes, individual market competitive conditions, and operating
income. The 1996 amount includes a write-off of $201 million of goodwill that
was determined to be impaired in accordance with SFAS 121.
Other Assets - Other assets consist of loan acquisition costs, assets
related to the supplemental executive retirement plan See Note N to
consolidated financial statements, restricted assets, deferred charges and
certain costs incurred to develop new service areas and new products prior to
the initiation of revenues. Loan acquisition costs are amortized over the term
of the related debt while the other assets are amortized over their expected
periods of benefit, where applicable. The preoperational new service area and
new product costs were amortized over their expected period of benefit up to
eight years. Effective April 1, 1997, the Company adopted a one-year period for
amortization of new service area and new product costs. $27 million of expense
was included in selling, general and administrative expense due to this change.
These costs were fully amortized at December 31, 1997. Accumulated amortization
of other assets was approximately $34 million and $91 million at December 31,
1998 and 1997, respectively.
Medical Claims Liabilities - Medical claims liabilities consist of
actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services
incurred but not reported. The estimated claims incurred but not reported are
based on historical data, current enrollment, health service utilization
statistics, and other related information. Although considerable variability is
inherent in such estimates, management believes that the liability is adequate.
The Company also establishes reserves, if required, for the probability that
anticipated future health care costs and                    35  38
maintenance costs under the group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated
future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts. The estimated
future costs include fixed and variable, direct and allocable, indirect costs.
These accruals are continually monitored and reviewed, and as settlements are
made or accruals adjusted, differences are reflected in current operations.
Changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience
could cause these estimates to change in the near term.
Revenue Recognition - Managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in
the month in which members are entitled to service. Premiums collected in
advance are recorded as deferred revenue. Employer contracts are typically on
an annual basis, subject to cancellation by the employer group or the Company
upon thirty days written notice. Management services revenues are recognized in
the period in which the related services are performed. Premiums for services
to federal employee groups are subject to audit and review by the Office of
Personnel Management OPM on a periodic basis. Such audits are usually a
number of years in arrears. The Company provides reserves, on an estimated
basis annually, based on the appropriate guidelines. Any differences between
actual results and estimates are recorded in the year the audits are finalized.
Such adjustments have not been material to the financial statements of the
Company.
Reinsurance - Premiums paid to reinsurers are reported as health
benefits expense and the related reinsurance recoveries are reported as
deductions from health benefits expense.
Income Taxes - The Company files a consolidated tax return for the
Company and its wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries. The Company accounts
for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109 SFAS 109. The deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are determined
by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax
reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to
be in effect when such differences are recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period
that includes the enactment date. See Note G for disclosures related to income
taxes.
Minority Interest - For 1997 and 1996, the minority interest
represents a joint venture interest of 51% in Pennsylvania HealthMate, Inc.
HealthMate. 
Stock-based Compensation - The Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. As permitted by SFAS 123,
the Company has elected to continue to account for stock-based compensation to
employees under APB Opinion No. 25, and complies with the disclosure
requirements for SFAS 123. See Note J for disclosures related to stock-based
compensation. 
Earnings per Share - In the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 SFAS 128,
Earnings per Share. SFAS 128 establishes new standards for computing and
presenting earnings per share EPS, replacing primary EPS with basic EPS.
Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to
common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
for the period. The adoption of SFAS 128 did not have a material effect on the
Company earnings per share. All prior periods have been restated to comply
with SFAS 128. See Note Q for calculation of EPS.
Comprehensive Earnings - Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130 SFAS 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income. SFAS 130 requires that changes in the amounts of certain
items, including unrealized gains and losses on certain securities, be shown in
the financial statements. The adoption of this standard did not have a material
effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. 
Segment reporting - Effective December 31, 1998, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 SFAS 131, Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. This standard
requires that a public business enterprise report financial and descriptive
information about its reportable operating segments. Operating segments are
components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is
available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in
deciding how                     36  39
to allocate resources and in assessing performance. SFAS 131 also requires that
all public business enterprises report information about the revenues derived
from the enterprise products or services or groups of similar products and
services, about the countries in which the enterprise earns revenues and holds
assets and about major customers regardless of whether that information is used
in making operating decisions. The Company has two reportable segments:
Commercial products and Government products. The products are provided to a
cross section of employer groups through the Company health plans in the
Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeastern United States. Commercial products
include HMO, PPO, and POS products. HMO products provide comprehensive health
care benefits to enrollees through a primary care physician. PPO and POS
products permit members to participate in managed care but allow them the
flexibility to utilize out of network providers in exchange for an increase in
out-of-pocket costs to the member. Governmental products include Medicare Risk,
Medicare Cost, and Medicaid. The Company provides comprehensive health benefits
to members participating in government programs and receives premium payments
from federal and state governments. The Company evaluates the performance of
its operating segments and allocates resources based on gross margin. Assets
are not allocated to specific products and, accordingly, cannot be reported by
segment. See Note S for disclosures on segment reporting.
Other New Pronouncements- In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No133 SFAS 133 , Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. This Statement requires companies to record
derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair
value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those
derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and
whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. This Statement is effective for
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. The Company does not believe that
adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its future results of
operations.
In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
AICPA issued Statement of Position 98-1 SOP 98-1, Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. SOP 98-1
provides authoritative guidance for the capitalization of certain costs related
to computer software developed or obtained for internal applications, such as
external direct costs of materials and services, payroll costs for employees and
certain interest costs. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage, as
well as training and data conversion costs, are to be expensed as incurred. SOP
98-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998. The
Company does not believe that adoption of this standard will have a material
effect on its future results of operations.
Reclassifications - Certain 1996 and 1997 amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the 1998 presentation.
B.    ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS
Effective April 1, 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of
certain assets of PHC from Principal Life for a total purchase price of
approximately $3302 million including transaction costs of approximately $57
million. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting, and accordingly the operating results of PHC have been included in
the Company consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.
The purchase price consisted of 25,043,704 shares of the Company common stock
at an assigned value of $1196 per share. In addition, a warrant valued at
$250 million the Warrant was issued that gives Principal Life the right to
acquire additional shares of stock in the event that their ownership percentage
is diluted below 40%. The warrant is included as a component of additional
paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Through
April 2003, Principal Life is restricted from buying additional shares of the
Company common stock to increase its ownership percentage above 40%.
Coincident with the closing of the transaction, the Company entered
into a Marketing Services Agreement and a Management Services Agreement with
Principal Life. Both agreements extend through December 31, 1999. The Company
recognized revenue of approximately $230 million for the year ended December
31, 1998 related to these agreements, and expects to receive payments of
approximately $264 million in 1999. 
The Company also entered into a Renewal Rights Agreement and a 
Coinsurance Agreement with Principal Life, whereby the Company manages certain
of Principal Life indemnity health insurance policies in the markets where the
Company does business and, on December 31, 1999, would offer to renew such
policies in force at that time.
As a result of the transaction, the Company assumed an agreement with 
Principal Life, whereby Principal Life pays a fee for access to the Company
PPO network based on a rate per contract and a percentage of savings realized by
Principal Life. The Company recognized revenue of approximately $120 million
for the year ended December 31, 1998 related to this agreement. The maximum
amount that can be paid under the percentage of savings component of the
agreement is $80 million for 1999. 
On December 31, 1998, the Company sold its subsidiary, Principal 
Health Care of Florida, Inc., for $950 million in cash. The Florida health
plan accounted for approximately 156,000 risk members and approximately 5,500
non-risk members as of December 31, 1998 and reported approximately $1725
million in revenues since April 1, 1998, the date of acquisition. 
Effective November 30, 1998, the Company sold its subsidiary,
Principal Health Care of Illinois, Inc., for $43 million in cash. The Illinois
health plan accounted for approximately 56,000 risk members and approximately
2,400 non-risk members as of November 30, 1998 and reported approximately $711
million in revenues since the date of acquisition. 
The proceeds from both sales were used to retire the Credit Facility,
to assist in improving the capital position of the Company regulated entities,
and for other general corporate purposes. Given the short time period between
the respective acquisition and sale dates and the lack of events or other
evidence which would indicate differing values, no gain or loss was recognized
on the sales of the Florida and Illinois health plans, as the sales prices were
considered by management to be equivalent to the fair values allocable to these
plans at the date of their acquisition from PHC in April 1998.
In connection with the acquisition of certain PHC health plans, and 
the sales of the Florida and Illinois plans, the Company recorded reserves in
purchase accounting of approximately $330 million for the estimated transition
costs of the PHC plans. These reserves are primarily comprised of severance
costs related to involuntary terminations of former PHC employees, relocation
costs of former PHC personnel, lease termination costs and contract termination
costs. For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company has expended
approximately $182 million related to these reserves. The Company expects to
make payments on the remaining reserves through July 2002.
The purchase price for certain of the PHC plans, net of the impact of
the sales of the Florida and Illinois health plans, was allocated to the
assets, including the identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities based on
estimated fair values. The excess of purchase price, over the net identified
tangible and intangible assets acquired of approximately $1344 million, was
allocated to goodwill. The amounts allocated to the identifiable intangible
assets and goodwill and their related useful lives are as follows Description            Amount       Useful Life

In August 1997, the Company entered into agreements to sell certain
medical offices associated with HealthAmerica, its health plan in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania. The sales price was $21 million and the transaction resulted in
a pretax loss of $02 million. Additionally, in the third quarter of 1997, the 
Company sold its two remaining medical offices in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for
$03 million in cash and recorded a pretax loss of $04 million. All gains or
losses resulting from medical office sales are reflected in other income, net in
the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Effective May 1, 1997, the Company completed its sale of the medical
offices associated with GHP, its health plan in St. Louis, Missouri, to a major
health care provider organization. The sales price was $269 million and the
transaction resulted in a pretax gain of approximately $96 million. Coincident
with the sale,                     38  41
the Company entered into a long-term global capitation agreement with the
purchaser covering approximately 83,000 members, pursuant to which the provider
organization receives a fixed percentage of premiums to cover all of the
medical treatment the globally capitated members receive.
Effective March 31, 1997, the Company completed its sale of the
medical offices associated with HealthAmerica Pennsylvania, Inc., its health
plan in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to a major health care provider organization.
The sales price was $200 million and the transaction resulted in a pretax gain
of approximately $60 million. Coincident with the sale, the Company entered
into a long-term global capitation agreement with the purchaser which increased
the globally capitated membership in western Pennsylvania to approximately
250,000 members. Under the agreement, the provider organization will receive a
fixed percentage of premiums to cover all of the medical treatment the globally
capitated members will receive.
Effective March 22, 1996, the Company purchased 81% of the common
stock of PARTNERS Health Plan of Pennsylvania, Inc. and acquired the remaining
19% of the common stock through the merger of a subsidiary of the Company with
and into PARTNERS, whose name was changed to Coventry Health Plan of
Pennsylvania, Inc.CHP. CHP is the holding company for Coventry Health Plan
of Western Pennsylvania, Inc., which, at the time of acquisition, was known as
Aetna Health Plan of Western Pennsylvania, Inc. and served approximately 16,000
HMO members in the Pittsburgh area. Consideration for the transaction was
approximately $35 million in cash, of which approximately $321 million was
recorded as goodwill. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting and, accordingly, the net assets were included in the
consolidated financial statements from the effective date of acquisition. During
1996, the Company determined that the intangible assets acquired were impaired
and $201 million of the goodwill was written off through amortization expense.
The Company believes the remaining intangible is realizable on a discounted cash
flow basis. C.  AHERF CHARGE
In March 1997, the Company entered into a global capitation agreement
with Allegheny Health, Education and Research Foundation AHERF covering
approximately 250,000 members in the western Pennsylvania market. Under the
agreement, AHERF was paid 78% to 82% of the premium to cover all of the medical
expenses of the capitated members. In July 1998, AHERF filed for bankruptcy
protection under Chapter 11. As a result, the Company, which is ultimately
responsible for the medical costs of the capitated members, recorded a charge
of $550 million to establish a reserve for the medical costs incurred by
members covered by the AHERF agreement at the time of the bankruptcy filing and
other potential bankruptcy charges. Under applicable bankruptcy laws, AHERF 
could reject and refuse to perform under the global caitation agreement.
Generally, under Chapter 11 a debtor company such as AHERF may affirm or reject
its contractual obligations prior to confirmation of a plan of reorganization,
and if a contract is rejected, the contractual damages become an unsecured claim
in the Chapter 11 proceeding. Although AHERF has not formally rejected the
risk-sharing agreement as of the date of this filing, the parties are
negotiating a resolution of the arrangement and, currently, neither AHERF nor
the Company is operating under the existing agreement. The Company has filed a
lawsuit against certain hospital subsidiaries of AHERF that were not included in
the bankruptcy filing. The lawsuit is seeking a court order declaring that the
Company is not liable for the payment of $215 million of medical services
provided by the hospitals to the Company members prior to the date of AHERF
bankruptcy filing and compelling the hospitals to fulfill their contractual
obligations to continue to provide health care services to the membership in
western Pennsylvania. The lawsuit also includes a claim for damages to recover
the losses incurred by the Company as a consequence of AHERF default of its
obligations under the risk-sharing agreement. In response to the lawsuit, the
hospitals have filed a counterclaim alleging that HAPA, notwithstanding AHERF
assumption of the payment obligation, is liable to the hospitals for the payment
of medical services provided prior to AHERF bankruptcy. The Company intends to
vigorously defend against the counterclaim. The Company believes that the
reserve established is adequate to provide for claims incurred related to the
AHERF arrangement and other related AHERF bankruptcy uncertainties.                    39  42
For the year ended December 31, 1998, $338 million has been paid for medical
claims related to this reserve. D.    MERGER COSTS
In connection with the acquisition of PHC, the Company relocated its
Corporate Headquarters from Nashville, Tennessee to Bethesda, Maryland. As a
result, the Company established a one-time reserve of approximately $65 million
for the incurred and anticipated costs related to the relocation of the
corporate office and other direct merger related costs. The reserve is
primarily comprised of severance costs related to involuntary terminations,
relocation costs for management personnel, and lease costs, net of sublease
income, related to the unused space remaining at the old headquarters location.
For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company has paid approximately $44
million related to the reserve. The Company expects to make payments through
December 2002 related to these charges.

respectively. 
F.    INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES
The Company considers all of its investments as available-for-sale
securities and, accordingly, records unrealized gains and losses, as other
comprehensive earnings, in the stockholders' equity section of its consolidated
balance sheets. As of December 31, 1998 and 1997, stockholders' equity was
increased by approximately $03 million and $06 million, respectively, net                     40  43
of a deferred tax cost of approximately $01 million and $04 million,
respectively, to reflect the net unrealized investment gain on securities.
The amortized cost, gross unrealized gain or loss and estimated fair
value of short-term and long-term investments by security type were as follows

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 1998 is $33
million due to the Company belief that the realization of a large portion of
the deferred tax asset resulting from federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards is doubtful. The valuation allowance provided at December 31,
1998 will be allocated to reduce goodwill and other intangible assets if the
realization of the net operating loss carryforwards becomes more likely than
not.                    43  46

J.    STOCK OPTIONS, WARRANTS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
As of December 31, 1998, the Company had one stock incentive plan, the
Amended and Restated 1998 Stock Incentive Plan the 1998 Plan, with an
aggregate of 7 million shares of common stock authorized for issuance
thereunder to key employees, consultants and directors in the form of stock
options, restricted stock and other stock-based awards. At April 1, 1998, the
1998 Plan assumed the obligations of six stock option plans of Coventry
Corporation with total outstanding options representing 3,322,714 shares, and
one stock option plan of Principal Health Care, Inc. with total outstanding
options representing 750,000 shares, as a result of the acquisition of the PHC
plans. Under the 1998 Plan, the terms and conditions of grants are established
on an individual basis with the exercise price of the options being equal to
not less than 100% of the market value of the underlying stock at the date of
grant. Options generally become exercisable after one year in 20% to 25%
increments per year and expire ten years from the date of grant.  The 1998
Plan is authorized to grant either incentive stock options or nonqualified
stock options at the discretion of the Compensation and Benefits Committee of
the Board of Directors.
As of September 10, 1998, employees of the Company were offered an
opportunity to exchange their existing options issued at a higher exercise
price for a reduced number of new options issued at a lower exercise price
equivalent to the same value as their existing options, based upon a
Black-Scholes equal valuation model. Employees could choose to decline the
offer of new options and keep their existing options. As a result, the 
Company cancelled approximately 4,370,100 shares, and reissued repriced options
equal to approximately 3,714,182 shares. The options canceled were at exercise
prices ranging from a high of $22750 to a low of $63750. The options were
reissued in accordance with an exchange formula using the Black-Scholes equal
valuation model that issued one-half of the new options at an exercise price
of the then current market value $500 and the remaining one-half at 150% of
the then current market value $750. The resulting value of the repriced
options was the same as the exchanged options.
The assumed plans are the Coventry Corporation 1997 Stock Incentive
Plan, the Coventry Corporation 1993 Stock Option Plan as amended, the
Southern Health Management Corporation 1993 Stock Option Plan, the Coventry
Corporation 1993 Outside Directors Stock Option Plan as amended, the Coventry
Corporation Third Amended and Restated 1989 Stock Option Plan, the Coventry
Corporation Amended and Restated 1987 Statutory-Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan,
and the Principal Health Care, Inc. 1997 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan.                    45  48
At various dates in 1996, the Company canceled, repriced, and reissued
approximately 13 million shares under option. The options canceled were at
prices ranging from a high of $2500 to a low of $1563. The shares were
reissued at market on the date of reissue and the prices ranged from a high of
$1813 to a low of $1275.
During 1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan the
1997 Plan. Under the 1997 Plan, the Company may grant options and other
rights with respect to the Company common stock to officers, other key
employees, consultants and outside directors of the Company. A total of
1,600,000 shares of common stock was reserved for this issuance.
With the merger of SHS in December 1994, the Company assumed SHS
incentive stock option plan. The Company issued options for 146,030 shares of
common stock in exchange for 42,500 options to acquire shares of SHS common
stock granted under SHS incentive stock option plan. These options were
exercisable upon the completion of the merger with SHS and expire in 2003.
The Company follows APB No. 25, under which no compensation cost has
been recognized in connection with stock option grants. Had compensation cost
for these plans been determined consistent with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, the Company net income and earnings per share would have been
reduced to the following pro forma amounts                        1998      1997     1996

& diluted      Pro Forma         027      026     195     Because the SFAS 123 method of accounting has not been applied to
options granted prior to January 1, 1995, the resulting pro forma compensation
cost may not be representative of that to be expected in future years.

-        The weighted-average grant date fair values for options granted in
1998, 1997 and 1996 were $453, $877, and $661, respectively.
At December 31, 1998, the Company had outstanding warrants granting
holders the right to purchase 6,075,373 shares of common stock.  In July 1995,
100,000 warrants were issued at a price of $14125 and expire in July 2000. In
December 1993, warrants were issued granting holders the right to purchase
800,000 shares at an exercise price of $2100. Of the 800,000 shares, 550,300
were exercised before the expiration of the warrants in December 1995, and the
remaining 249,700 shares expired. During the first half of 1996, warrants for
170,000 shares were exercised at a price of $675 per share.
On July 7, 1997, the Company finalized the sale of $40 million of 
Coventry Convertible Exchangeable Subordinated Notes, together with warrants to 
purchase 235 million shares at $10625 per share of common                    47  50
stock. The purchase price for the warrants was $100 per share, valued by
Coventry and the purchaser. The warrants expire seven years from the purchase
date.
On April 1, 1998, the Company issued a warrant to PHC the Principal
Warrant to purchase that number of shares of common stock equal to 66-2/3% of
the total number of shares of common stock actually issued upon the exercise or
conversion of the Company employee stock options issued and outstanding at
March 31, 1998, on the same terms and conditions as set forth in the respective
options and warrants. Options and warrants that terminated or expired and are
not exercised, are also canceled in the Principal Warrant. At March 31, 1998,
the Company had options and warrants outstanding for 5,800,480 shares of common
stock, representing the right to purchase 3,866,986 shares under the Principal
Warrant.  At December 31, 1998, the Principal Warrant represented the right to
purchase 3,462,368 shares, taking into account cancellations.
On May 18, 1998, the Company issued warrants to four individual
consultants to purchase 40,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of
$13625 per share, expiring in 2003.  On October 22, 1998, the Company issued
warrants to certain providers to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock at an
exercise price of $7625 per share, expiring in 2003. On December 21, 1998,
the Company issued a warrant to an individual in connection with the
acquisition of a health plan to purchase 85,239 shares of common stock at an
exercise price of $832 per share, expiring in 2003.
The Company implemented an Employee Stock Purchase Plan in 1994, which
allows substantially all employees who meet length of service requirements to
set aside a portion of their salary for the purchase of the Company common
stock. At the end of each plan year, the Company will issue the stock to
participating employees at an issue price equal to 85% of the lower of the
stock price at the end of the plan year or the average stock price, as defined.
The Company has reserved 10 million shares of stock for this plan and has
issued 15,016, 7,074, and 19,465 shares in 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively. K.    REINSURANCE
The Company has reinsurance agreements, through its subsidiary CHLIC,
with American Continental Insurance Company and Continental Assurance Company
for portions of the risk it has underwritten through its products. These
reinsurance agreements do not release the Company of its primary obligations to
its membership. Reinsurance premiums for the years ended December 31, 1998,
1997 and 1996, were approximately $10 million, $07 million and $18 million
respectively. Reinsurance recoveries for the same periods were approximately
$06 million, $04 million and $15 million. The Company remains liable to
its membership if the reinsurers are unable to meet their contractual
obligations under the reinsurance agreements. All reinsurance agreements are
subject to certain limits on hospital costs per patient-day. To minimize its
exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies, the Company
evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers on an annual basis.
American Continental Insurance Company and Continental Assurance Company are
both currently A rated by the A.M. Best Company.
Medicaid risk exposures in Missouri are reinsured through the State of
Missouri mandated program with retention of $50,000 per member per year and 20%
coinsurance. Reinsurance recoveries for the years ended December 31, 1998 and
1997 were approximately $40 million and $12 million, respectively. 
There were no reinsurance recoveries for the year ended December 31, 1996.
L.    COMMITMENTS
The Company operates primarily in leased facilities with original
lease terms of up to ten years with options for renewal. The Company also
leases computer equipment with lease terms of approximately three years.
Leases that expire generally are expected to be renewed or replaced by other
leases.                    48  51
The minimum rental commitments payable and minimum sublease rentals to
be received by the Company during each of the next five years ending December
31 and thereafter for noncancellable operating leases are as follows in

Total rent expense was approximately $146 million, $83 million and
$117 million for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. M.    CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents,
investments in marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company
invests its excess cash in interest bearing deposits with major banks,
commercial paper and money market funds. Investments in marketable securities
are managed within guidelines established by the Board of Directors which
emphasize investment-grade fixed income securities and limit the amount that
may be invested in any one issuer. The fair value of the Company financial
instruments is substantially equivalent to their carrying value and, although
there is some credit risk associated with these instruments, the Company
believes this risk to be minimal.
As discussed in Notes B and C to consolidated financial statements, the
Company entered into long-term global capitation arrangements with two
integrated provider organizations. To the extent that the Company becomes a
party to global capitation agreements with a single provider organization
serving substantial membership, the Company becomes exposed to credit risk with
respect to such organizations. The Company may utilize the following to manage
such risk: 1 contract with providers with significant net worth and cash
reserves; 2 require letters of credit or cash to be reserved for claims
payment and 3 monitor the providers' financial condition in regard to the
Company membership.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is
limited due to the large number of customers comprising the Company customer
base and their breakdown among geographical locations. See Note A for
additional information with respect to accounting policies for accounts
receivable.
The Company believes the allowance for doubtful collections adequately
provides for estimated losses as of December 31, 1998. The Company has a risk
of incurring loss if such allowances are not adequate.
As discussed in Note K to consolidated financial statements, the
Company has reinsurance agreements with a major insurance company. The Company
monitors the insurance companies' financial ratings to determine compliance with
standards set by state law. The Company has a credit risk associated with
these reinsurance agreements to the extent the reinsurer is unable to pay valid
reinsurance claims of the Company. N.    BENEFIT PLANS                    49  52
On July 1, 1994, Coventry Corporation adopted an employee defined
contribution retirement plan qualifying under IRC Section 401k, the Coventry
Corporation Retirement Savings Plan the Plan, which covers substantially all
employees of Coventry Corporation and its subsidiaries who meet certain
requirements as to age and length of service and who elect to participate in the
Plan. Similar retirement savings plans offered by 1 both HAPA and GHP and 2

Q.    EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share EPS is based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS assumes the conversion
of convertible notes and the exercise of all options and warrants using the
treasury stock method. Net earnings is increased for interest expense on the
convertible notes. In all cases, however, losses are not diluted.
The following table summarizes the earnings and the average number of
common shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS in thousands,

certain assets of PHC from Principal Life. The acquisition was 
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly,

merger, an estimated reserve of $78 million was established for the costs
related to the relocation of the corporate office from Nashville, 
Tennessee to Bethesda, Maryland and other merger related expenses.

establishment of a reserve for the costs incurred by members covered by
the AHERF agreement and other potential charges as a result of the
bankruptcy filing by AHERF. The establishment of the reserves resulted
in a charge to earnings of $550 million.
3  The merger costs were less than the reserve established in the second 
quarter of 1998, resulting in a credit to earnings of $13 million.

majority of its medical offices in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania associated 
with HAPA to a major health care provider organization. The sale price was
