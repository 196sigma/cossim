Stockholders of
Canterbury Park Holding
Corporation
Shakopee, Minnesota We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Canterbury Park Holding Corporation
and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in
accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor
were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,
we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Canterbury Park Holding Corporation and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2005 and 2004 and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Deloitte Touche LLP March 27, 2006

PARK HOLDING CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003 1. SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business
- - Canterbury Park Holding Corporation the Company was incorporated on March
24, 1994. On March 29, 1994 the Company acquired all the outstanding securities
of Jacobs Realty, Inc. JRI from Irwin Jacobs and IMR Fund, L.P. an
investment fund for various pension plans and trusts. JRI was merged into the Company and the
acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting whereby
the acquired assets and liabilities have been recorded at the Companys cost. The
primary asset of JRI was Canterbury Downs Racetrack and the 325 acres of
surrounding land. On May 20, 1994, the Company adopted a plan
of Reorganization pursuant to which the sole shareholder of Canterbury Park
Concessions, Inc. CPC, and majority shareholder of the Company, agreed to
exchange his shares of CPC stock for 198,888 shares of the Companys common
stock concurrent with the closing of a public offering. Pursuant to the Plan of
Reorganization, CPC became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company in August
1994 when the Company completed the initial public offering of its common
stock. This reorganization was treated in a manner similar to a pooling of
interests. Net proceeds received by the Company from the public offering were
approximately $4,847,000, which along with additional borrowings under the
Companys line of credit with the majority shareholder, were used to pay off
the remaining notes payable from the acquisition of JRI. The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company, CPC and Shakopee Valley RV Park Acquisition
Company, LLC after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. Revenue Recognition - Our revenues are derived primarily
from the operations of a Card Club, pari-mutuel wagering on simulcast and live
horse races, concession sales and related activities. Collection revenue from
Card Club operations and pari-mutuel commission and fee revenues are recognized
at the time that the wagering process is complete. Revenues related to wagering
activities including concession and publication sales, and parking and
admission fees are recognized as revenue when the service has been performed or
the product has been delivered. Estimates - The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from these estimates. Reclassifications 
Certain prior year numbers have been reclassified to be consistent with current
period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net earnings or
stockholders equity. In our consolidated statement of cash flows we changed
the classification of changes in restricted cash balances to present such
changes as an investing activity. We previously presented such changes as an
operating activity. In the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows
for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 we reclassified changes in
restricted cash balances to be consistent with our 2005 presentation which
resulted in an increase of $459,861 and a decrease of $468,093, respectively,
in cash used in investing activities and a corresponding increase and decrease,
respectively, in cash flows provided by operations from the amounts previously
reported. In addition, we reclassified acquisitions of land, building and
equipment funded through accounts payable at year-end to a noncash investing
activity to be consistent with our 2005 presentation. In the accompanying
consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003 we reclassified $250,462 and $81,545, respectively to a noncash investing
activity. These acquisitions were previously presented as increases in accounts
payable under operating activities and additions to land, buildings and
equipment under investing activities and resulted in decreases in these items
from amounts previously reported. Uncashed Winning Tickets Pari-mutuel
tickets which are not cashed within one year of the end of the respective race
meet become the property of the Company. The Company records revenue associated
with the uncashed winning tickets at the time that, based on historical
experience, management can reasonably estimate the amount of additional winning
tickets from a race meet that will be presented for payment. 37 Pari-mutuel Taxes The first $12 million of pari-mutuel
revenue is exempt from the 6% pari-mutuel tax. Pari-mutuel taxes are estimated
for each 12-month period from July 1 through June 30, and an estimated annual
effective tax rate is applied to all pari-mutuel commission revenues. Restricted Cash 
Restricted cash represents refundable deposits and amounts due to horsemen for
purses, stakes and awards, and amounts accumulated in card game progressive
jackpot pools, the Player Pool and Poker Promotional Fund to be used to repay
card players in the form of promotions, giveaways, prizes, or by other means. Due to Minnesota Horsemens Benevolent and
Protective Association, Inc. MHBPA - The Minnesota
Pari-Mutuel Horse Racing Act specifies that the Company is required to
segregate a portion of funds recorded as purse expense in the statements of
operations, received from card club operations and wagering on simulcast and
live horse races, for future payment as purses for live horse races or other uses
of the horsepersons associations. Pursuant to an agreement with the MHBPA, the
Company has transferred into a trust account or paid directly to the MHBPA,
approximately $7,575,000, $7,601,000 and $6,770,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to thoroughbred races. Amounts
due to the MHBPA, are guaranteed by the Chairman of the Board. Minnesota
Statutes specify that amounts transferred into the trust account are the
property of the trust and not of the Company. The interest rates on any purses
accrued but not transferred into the trust were 725%, 525% and 400% at
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - Management
of the Company periodically reviews the carrying value of property and
equipment for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of these
assets with their related expected future net cash flows. Should the sum of the
related expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value,
management will determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. An
impairment loss would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of
the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. To date, management has
determined that no impairment of these assets exists. Depreciation -
Buildings and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 5 to 39 years. Card Club Accruals Minnesota law allows the Company to collect amounts from patrons to fund
progressive jackpot pools in the Card Club. These amounts, along with amounts
earned by the player pool, promotional pools and the outstanding chip
liability, are accrued as short-term liabilities at each balance sheet date. Borrowings - The
weighted average interest rates on short-term borrowings at December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003 were 725%, 525% and 400%, respectively. The weighted average
rates for short-term borrowings for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003 were 590%, 423% and 417%, respectively. Income Taxes -
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to
reverse. Net Income Per Share
- - Basic net income per common share is based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during each year. Diluted net income per common share
takes into effect the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding. The
Companys only potential common shares outstanding are stock options. Comprehensive Income Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for reporting and
display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of financial
statements. Comprehensive income includes all changes in stockholders equity
except those resulting from investments by and distributions to owners. SFAS
No. 130 is not currently applicable for the Company because the Company did not
have any items of other comprehensive income in any of the periods presented. 38 Fair Values of Financial Instruments Due to
the current classification of all financial instruments of the Company and
given the short-term nature of the related account balances, carrying amounts
reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123 SFAS 123 - In 1996, the Company adopted SFAS
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. As permitted by SFAS
123, the Company has elected to continue following the guidance of APB 25 for
measurement and recognition of stock-based transactions with employees. No
compensation cost has been recognized for stock options issued under the Stock
Option Plan because the exercise price of all options granted was at least
equal to the fair value of the common stock at the date of grant. If
compensation cost for the Companys Stock Plan and Employee Stock Purchase Plan
had been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates, consistent with
the method provided in SFAS 123, the Companys net income and earnings per
share would have been as follows

Accounting Pronouncements
- - In December 2004, the FASB revised SFAS No. 123, Share Based Payment SFAS No.
123R. This Statement supercedes Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, which resulted in no stock-based
employee compensation cost related to stock options if the options granted had
an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on
the date of grant. SFAS No. 123R requires recognition of employee services
provided in exchange for a share-based payment based on the grant date fair
market value. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 123R effective January
1, 2006 and plan to adopt this Statement using the Modified Prospective Method.
As of the effective date, this Statement applies to all new awards issued as
well as awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled. Additionally, for
stock-based awards issued prior to the effective date, compensation cost
attributable to future services will be recognized as the remaining service is
rendered. 39 2. LAND, BUILDINGS AND

provides for the granting of awards in the form of stock options, restricted
stock, stock appreciation rights, and deferred stock to key employees and
non-employees, including directors of and consultants to the Company and any
subsidiary, to purchase up to a maximum of 1,450,000 shares of common stock. Options
that are granted under the Plan may be either options that qualify as incentive
stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended Incentive Stock Options, or those that do not qualify as
Incentive Stock Options Non-Qualified Stock Options. The Plan is administered
by the Board of Directors, or a committee designated by the Board, which
determines the persons who are to receive awards under the Plan, the type of
award to be granted, the number of shares subject to each award and, if an
option, the exercise price of each option. The Plan also provides for formula
grants of Non-Qualified Stock Options to non-employee directors of the Company. Stock option activity related to the Plan
during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is summarized below

The Plan provides that payment
of the exercise price may be made in the form of unrestricted shares of common
stock already owned by the optionee. The Company calculates the fair market
value of unrestricted shares as the average of the high and low sales prices on
the date of exercise. During 2004, the
Company purchased and retired 752 shares valued at $14,364. Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 3, 1995, the Board of Directors
adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the plan. The plan is open to all
employees of the Company working more than 15 hours per week. The plan consists
of one-year phases. The phases commence on October 1 of each year and under the
terms of the plan employees were allowed to set aside a portion of their
payroll earnings to purchase shares of the Companys common stock. Prior to the
phase which started October 1, 2005, the purchase price was the lower of 85% of
the fair market value of the shares on the commencement date of each phase or
85% of the fair market value on the termination date of each phase. Effective
with the phase beginning October 1, 2005 the purchase price is 95% of the fair
market value of the shares on the termination date of the 41 phase. The plan provides for the sale of up
to 250,000 shares. The plan issued 31,174, 29,202 and 32,396 shares in 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The plan has issued a total of 215,999 shares
since the inception of the plan. 401k Plan On June 1, 1998 the Company established a
defined contribution savings plan for employees who had completed one year of
service, as defined in the Plan document. The defined contribution savings plan
allows for employee compensation deferral contributions under Section 401k of
the Internal Revenue Code and discretionary contributions by the Company. Employer
contributions charged to operations in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were approximately
$128,000, $113,000 and $108,000, respectively. Employee Stock Ownership Plan In December 2004, the Companys Board of
Directors approved an Employee Stock Ownership Plan effective for calendar
years beginning January 1, 2004. All eligible employees of the Company
participate in the ESOP Plan after completing one full calendar year of
service. Contributions to the plan are determined by the Board of Directors and
can be made in cash or shares of the Companys common stock. Annual
contributions are allocated to each participant based on compensation and vest
in accordance with a seven year graded vesting schedule. Compensation expense
for the ESOP is determined based on the average fair value of shares on the
date the Company commits to the contribution to the Plan. For the purposes of
earnings per share, ESOP shares are included in weighted-average common shares
outstanding at year-end as the shares are committed to be contributed on that
date. On December 22, 2005, the Company committed to contribute 14,000 shares
of the Companys common stock valued at $197,400. The shares were issued in
January 2006 and will be allocated to the accounts of eligible employees based
upon their 2005 compensation during the first quarter of 2006. The Company
contributed 15,000 shares of the Companys common stock valued at $252,000 for
calendar year 2004. During 2005, the Company contributed an additional 142
shares valued at $2,000 for calendar year 2004. 5. EARNINGS PER SHARE

Options
to purchase 157,833 shares of common stock at an average of $1675 per share
were outstanding at December 31, 2005 but were not included in the computation
of diluted EPS because the options exercise price was greater than the average
market price of the common shares. The options expire in an average of 59
years. 6. LINES OF
CREDIT The Company has a general credit and security
agreement with Bremer Bank, N.A. Borrowings under the credit agreement include
a commercial revolving credit line, which provides for maximum advances of 42 2,250,000 with interest at the prime rate
until April 30, 2007. The Company had no borrowings under the credit line
during the year 2005. The credit agreement contains covenants requiring the
Company to maintain certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance
with these requirements as of December 31, 2005. Management believes that funds
available under this line of credit, along with funds generated from card club
and simulcast operations, will be sufficient to satisfy its liquidity and
capital resource requirements during 2006. 7. OPERATING LEASES AND
COMMITMENTS In January 2004 the Company entered into a
five-year totalizator services agreement with Autotote Systems, Inc.
Autotote. Pursuant to the agreement, Autotote provides totalizator equipment
and computer programs which record and process all wagers and calculate the
odds and payoffs. Amounts charged to operations under this agreement for the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were approximately $348,000 370,000 and $390,000, respectively. During annual live race meets, Autotote
provides uplink services, which enables the Company to simulcast horse races
held at Canterbury Park to out-of-state racetracks. These services resulted in
amounts charged to operations in 2005, 2004 and 2003 of approximately $137,500 135,500 and $126,000, respectively. We have entered into operating leases for rental of
office equipment and equipment to print certain publications. Amounts charged
to operations under these agreements for the yeasr ended December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003 were approximately $162,000, $170,000 and $170,000, respectively.
All such leases expire on or before November 30, 2008. Future lease payment
obligations under these leases are $72,200, $55,600 and $43,900 in 2006, 2007
and 2008, respectively. 8. CONTINGENCIES In connection with the purchase of the
Racetrack Note 1, the Company entered into an Earn Out Promissory Note dated
March 29, 1994. In accordance with the Earn Out Note, if i off-track betting
becomes legally permissible in the State of Minnesota and ii the Company
begins to conduct off-track betting with respect to or in connection with its
operations, the Company will be required to pay to the IMR Fund, L.P. the
greater of $700,000 per operating year, as defined, or 20% of the net pretax profit,
as defined for each of five operating years. At this time, management believes
that the likelihood that these two conditions will be met, and that the Company
will be required to pay these amounts is remote. At the date if any that
these two conditions are met, the five minimum payments will be discounted back
to their present value and the sum of those discounted payments will be
capitalized as part of the purchase price in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The purchase price will be further increased if payments
become due under the 20% of Net Pretax Profit calculation. The first payment
is to be made 90 days after the end of the third operating year in which
off-track betting is conducted by the Company. Remaining payments would be made
within 90 days of the end of each of the next four operating years. The Company is periodically involved in
various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. At December 31,
2005, management believes that the resolution of any legal actions outstanding
will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 9. RELATED-PARTY
TRANSACTIONS The president/director and two other
directors have guaranteed performance by the Company under a $500,000 bond
issued to the Minnesota Racing Commission. The Company paid a total of $50,100 in 2005 50,052 in 2004 and $62,000 in 2003 to the Chair and Vice Chair of the Company
in consideration for the services they provided pursuant to consulting
agreements. In addition, another non-employee Board member received $25,500 in
2005, $32,000 in 2004 and $61,000 in 2003 for services related to building
support for proposed legislation to provide additional gaming authority to the
Company. 43 10. OPERATING SEGMENTS The Company has three reportable operating
segments: card club, horse racing, and concessions. The card club segment
includes operations of the Canterbury Card Club. The horse racing segment
includes simulcast and live horse racing operations, and the concessions
segment provides concessions during simulcast and live racing, in the card club
and during special events. The Companys reportable operating segments are
strategic business units that offer different products and services. They are
managed separately because the segments differ in the nature of the products
and services provided, as well as processes to produce those products and
services. The horse racing and card club segments are regulated by the State of
Minnesota Racing Commission. The accounting policies of the operating
segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies Depreciation, interest expense and income
taxes are allocated to the segments but no allocation is made to concessions
for shared facilities. The concessions segment paid approximately 25% of gross
revenues on live racing and special event days to the horse racing segment for
use of the facilities in 2005, 2004 and 2003. The
following tables provide information about the Companys operating segments in
