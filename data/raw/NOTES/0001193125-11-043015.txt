ITEM8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 
COMPANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
The financial statements and related information contained in this Annual Report have been prepared by and are the responsibility of our management. Our
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and reflect judgments and estimates as to the expected effects of transactions and events currently being reported.
Our management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the financial statements and other financial information included in this Annual Report. To meet this responsibility, we maintain a system of internal control over financial
reporting to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly executed and recorded. The system includes policies and procedures, internal audits and our officers reviews. 
Our Audit Committee of our Board of Directors is composed solely of directors
who are independent under applicable SEC and New York Stock Exchange rules. Our Audit Committee meets periodically and, when appropriate, separately with representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm, our officers and the
internal auditors to monitor the activities of each. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, was appointed by our Audit Committee to audit our financial statements and
our internal control over financial reporting and their report follows. Our stockholders ratified the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP at the 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, as required by Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Based on its assessment, management has concluded that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010, based on criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the COSO. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2010, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included below.   /s/ William H. Swanson s/ David C. Wajsgras

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Raytheon Company: 
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of equity, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Raytheon Company and its subsidiaries at December31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit
of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2008,
the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for obligations associated with certain life insurance agreements. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Consolidation and ClassificationThe consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Raytheon Company, and all wholly-owned and majority-owned domestic and otherwise controlled foreign subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. For classification of certain current assets and
liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year. In addition, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. As
used in these notes, the terms we, us, our, Raytheon and the Company mean Raytheon Company and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates another meaning. 
Use of EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are based
on the application of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.
Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our
consolidated financial statements.  Revenue
RecognitionWe account for our long-term contracts associated with the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex aerospace or electronic equipment and related services, such as certain cost-plus service contracts, using
the percentage-of-completion accounting method. Under this method, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the long-term contract. We combine closely related contracts when all the applicable criteria under GAAP
are met. Similarly, we may segment a project, which may consist of a single contract or a group of contracts, with varying rates of profitability, only if all the applicable criteria under GAAP are met. 
We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for all of our
long-term contracts unless we believe another method more clearly measures progress towards completion of the contract. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs
incurred-to-date to the total estimated costs at completion of the contract. Revenues, including estimated earned fees or profits, are recorded as costs are incurred. Incentive and award fees are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer
or upon achievement of certain program milestones or cost targets. Incentive and award fees, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating profit rates. Estimates of award fees are based on actual awards and
anticipated performance, which may include the performance of subcontractors or partners depending upon the individual contract requirements. Incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are
generally not recognized until the event occurs. Such incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Our claims on contracts are recorded only if it is probable the claim will
result in additional contract revenue and the amounts can be reliably estimated.  Changes in estimates of net sales, costs of sales and the related impact to operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the
changes on current and prior periods. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue
to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period the loss is determined.  To a much lesser extent, we enter into contracts that are not associated with the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex aerospace or electronic equipment and related services.
Revenue under such contracts is generally recognized upon delivery or as the service is performed. Revenue on contracts to sell software is recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists, the software has been delivered and accepted by the
customer, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Revenue from non-software license fees is recognized over the expected life of the continued involvement with the customer. Royalty revenue is recognized when earned. Revenue
generated from fixed-price service contracts not associated with the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex aerospace or electronic equipment is recognized as services are rendered once persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, our price is fixed or determinable, and we have determined collectability is reasonably assured. 
75 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
We apply the separation guidance under GAAP for contracts with multiple deliverables. Revenue
arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables should be divided into more than one unit of accounting. For contracts with more than one unit of accounting, we recognize revenue for each deliverable based on
the revenue recognition policies described above.  Research and
Development ExpensesExpenditures for Company-sponsored research and development projects and bid and proposal costs are expensed as incurred. Customer-sponsored research and development projects performed under contracts are accounted for
as contract costs as the work is performed and included in contracts in process in our consolidated balance sheets. Bid and proposal costs were between 40% and 50% of total research and development expenses in 2010, 2009 and 2008. 
Federal, Foreign and State Income TaxesThe Company and its
domestic subsidiaries provide for federal income taxes on pretax accounting income at rates in effect under existing tax law. Foreign subsidiaries record provisions for income taxes at applicable foreign tax rates in a similar manner. Such
provisions differ from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. The payments made for state income taxes are
included in administrative and selling expenses as these costs can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. Government in the period in which the tax is payable. Accordingly, the state income tax provision
benefit is allocated to contracts in future periods as described below in Deferred Contract Costs.  Other Income ExpenseOther income expense consists primarily of gains and losses from our investments held in rabbi trusts used to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation
plans, gains and losses on the early repurchase of long-term debt and certain financing fees.  Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. 
Contracts in ProcessContracts in process are stated at cost plus
estimated profit, but not in excess of estimated realizable value. Included in contracts in process is accounts receivables, which includes amounts billed and due from customers. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the
estimated amount of accounts receivable that will not be collected. The allowance is based upon an assessment of customer credit-worthiness, historical payment experience, the age of outstanding receivables and collateral to the extent applicable.
Deferred Contract CostsIncluded in contracts in
process are certain costs incurred in the performance of our U.S. Government contracts which are required to be recorded under GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs are deferred and primarily include a portion of our
environmental expenses, asset retirement obligations, certain restructuring costs, deferred state income taxes, workers compensation and other accruals. At December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, net deferred contract costs were
approximately $340 million and $305 million, respectively. These costs are allocated to contracts when they are paid or otherwise agreed. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs. This assessment requires us to make assumptions
about the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity. If the level of backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be
adversely affected.  Pension and other postretirement benefit
costs are allocated to our contracts as allowed costs based upon the U.S. Government cost accounting standards CAS. The CAS requirements for pension and other postretirement benefit costs differ from the financial accounting standards FAS
requirements under GAAP. Given the inability to match with reasonable certainty individual expense and income items between the CAS and FAS requirements to determine specific recoverability, we have not estimated the incremental FAS income or
expense to be recoverable under our expected future contract activity, and therefore did not defer any FAS expense for pension and other postretirement benefit plans in 2008-2010. This resulted in $230 million of expense, $27 million of income and
$123 million of expense in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, reflected in our consolidated results of operations for the difference between CAS and FAS requirements for our pension plans in those years. 
76 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
InventoriesInventories are stated at cost first-in, first-out or average cost, but not in
excess of realizable value. A write down for excess or inactive inventory is recorded based upon an analysis that considers current inventory levels, historical usage patterns, future sales expectations and salvage value. 
Inventories consisted of the following at December31: In millions
2010 2009 Materials and purchased parts 63 60 Work in process 278 257 Finished goods 22 27 Total 363 344
We capitalize costs incurred in advance of contract award or funding in inventories, precontract costs, if we determine contract award or funding is
probable, excluding any start-up costs. We included capitalized precontract and other deferred costs of $116 million and $88 million in inventories as work in process at December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, respectively. 
Property, Plant and Equipment, NetProperty, plant and equipment,
net are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major improvements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor improvements are expensed. We include gains and losses on the sales of plant and equipment that are
allocable to our contracts in overhead as we can generally recover these costs through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. Government. For all other sales or asset retirements, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and
amortization are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income.  Provisions for depreciation are generally computed using a combination of accelerated and straight-line methods and are based on estimated useful lives as follows: Years Machinery and equipment 3-10 Equipment leased to others 5-10 Buildings 20-45
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the remaining life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement. 
Impairment of Goodwill and Long-lived AssetsWe evaluate our
goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of that goodwill may not be recoverable. We perform our annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter utilizing a two-step methodology
that requires us to first identify potential goodwill impairment and then measure the amount of the related goodwill impairment loss, if any. We have identified our operating segments as reporting units under the impairment test assessment criteria
outlined in GAAP. In performing our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 2009, we did not identify any goodwill impairment. 
We determine whether long-lived assets are to be held for use or disposal. Upon indication of possible impairment of long-lived assets held for use, we
evaluate the recoverability of such assets by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows. When an evaluation indicates that the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to
recover the carrying value of the asset, the asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value. In order for long-lived assets to be considered held for disposal, we must have committed to a plan to dispose of the assets. Once deemed held for disposal,
the assets are stated at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value. 
77 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
Computer Software, NetInternal use computer software, net, included in other assets, net,
which consists primarily of an integrated financial software package used across the Company, is stated at cost less accumulated amortization and is amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life, generally ten years.
Advance Payments and Billings in Excess of Costs
IncurredWe receive advances, performance-based payments and progress payments from customers that may exceed costs incurred on certain contracts. We classify advance payments and billings in excess of costs incurred, other than those
reflected as a reduction of contracts in process, as current liabilities.  Comprehensive IncomeComprehensive income and its components are presented in the consolidated statements of equity. 
Accumulated other comprehensive loss AOCL consisted of the following at
December31:  In millions
2010 2009 Unfunded projected benefit obligation 5,167 4,892 Foreign exchange translation 28 46 Cash flow hedges 3 22 Unrealized gains on investments 2 Interest rate lock 10 2 Total 5,146 4,824
The unfunded projected benefit obligation is shown net of tax benefits of $2,764 million and $2,634 million at December31, 2010 and
December31, 2009, respectively. The cash flow hedges are shown net of tax liability of $2 million and net of tax liability of $11 million at December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, respectively. The unrealized gains on investments
are shown net of tax liabilities of less than $1 million and $1 million at December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, respectively. The interest rate locks are shown net of tax benefits of $6 million and $1 million at December31, 2010
and December31, 2009, respectively. We expect approximately $4 million of after-tax net unrealized gains on our cash flow hedges at December31, 2010, to be reclassified into earnings at then-current values over the next twelve months as
the underlying hedged transactions occur.  Translation of
Foreign CurrenciesAssets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at current exchange rates and the effects of these translation adjustments are reported as a component of AOCL in stockholders equity. Deferred taxes are
not recognized for translation related temporary differences of foreign subsidiaries as their undistributed earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Income and expenses in foreign currencies are translated at the average exchange rate
during the period. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses in 2010, 2009 and 2008 were not material.  Treasury StockWe account for treasury stock under the cost method. When shares are reissued or retired from treasury stock they are accounted for at average price. Upon retirement the excess
over par value is charged against additional paid-in capital. The remaining treasury stock activity primarily relates to stock-based compensation awards and the related shares withheld to settle employee tax obligations. 
Pension CostsWe have pension plans covering the majority of our
employees, including certain employees in foreign countries. We must calculate our pension costs as required under GAAP and the calculations and assumptions utilized require judgment. GAAP outlines the methodology used to determine pension expense
or income for financial reporting purposes. 
78 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
For purposes of determining
pension expense under GAAP, investment gains and losses are spread over 3 years to develop a market-related value of the assets. 
We recognize the funded status of a postretirement benefit plan defined benefit pension and other benefits as an asset or liability on our consolidated
balance sheets. Funded status represents the difference between the projected benefit obligation of the plan and the market value of the plans assets. Previously unrecognized deferred amounts such as demographic or asset gains or losses and
the impact of historical plan changes are included in AOCL. Changes in these amounts in future years will be reflected through AOCL and amortized in future pension expense over the average employee service period. 
Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe enter into foreign currency
forward contracts with commercial banks to fix the foreign currency exchange rates on specific commitments and payments to vendors, and customer receipts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are transaction driven and directly relate to a
particular asset, liability or transaction for which commitments are in place. For foreign currency forward contracts designated and qualified for cash flow hedge accounting, we record the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative in
AOCL, net of tax, and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged revenue or cost of sales transaction affects earnings. 
We recognize all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. We measure and record
the impact of counterparty credit risk into our valuation and the impact was less than $1 million as of December31, 2010. We designate most foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases and sales denominated in
foreign currencies, and interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of our fixed-rate financing obligations. We classify the cash flows from these instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged items. We do not hold or issue
derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  Realized gains and losses resulting from these cash flow hedges offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying transactions being hedged. Gains and losses on derivatives not designated for
hedge accounting or representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized currently in cost of sales or net sales. 
79 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
We also periodically enter
into pay-variable, receive-fixed interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our fixed-rate financing obligations. We account for our interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of a portion of our fixed-rate financing obligations,
and accordingly record gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these swaps in interest expense, along with the offsetting gains and losses on the fair value adjustment of the hedged portion of our fixed-rate financing obligations. We also
record in interest expense the net amount paid or received under the swap for the period and the amortization of gain or loss from the early termination of interest rate swaps. For a discussion of the impacts of our hedging activities on our
results, see page86 of this Form 10-K.  Fair
ValuesThe accounting standard for fair value measurements provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an
asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This accounting standard established a fair value
hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required, as well as the assets and liabilities that we value using those levels of inputs.
Level1:
Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Our Level 1 assets are investments in marketable securities held in rabbi trusts that we use to pay
benefits under certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans, which we include in other assets, net. Our Level 1 liabilities include our obligations to pay certain non-qualified deferred compensation plan benefits, which we include in
accrued retiree benefits and other long-term liabilities. Under these non-qualified deferred compensation plans, participants designate investment options primarily mutual funds to serve as the basis for measurement of the notional value of their
accounts. We also include foreign currency forward contracts that we trade in an active exchange market in our Level 1 assets and liabilities.  Level2:
Observable inputs, other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs
that are observable or that we corroborate with observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities. We did not have any Level 2 assets or liabilities at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.
Level3:
Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. We did not have any Level 3 assets or
liabilities at December 31, 2010.  Earnings per
ShareWe compute basic EPS attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders by dividing income from continuing operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders, income loss from discontinued operations
attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders and net income attributable to Raytheon Company, by our weighted-average common shares outstanding, including participating securities outstanding, as described below, during the period. Diluted
EPS reflects the potential dilution beyond shares for basic EPS that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised, converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that would have shared in
our earnings. We compute basic and diluted EPS using actual income from continuing operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders, income loss from discontinued operations attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders, net
income attributable to Raytheon Company, and our actual weighted-average shares and participating securities outstanding rather than the numbers presented within our consolidated financial statements, which are rounded to the nearest million. As a
result, it may not be possible to recalculate EPS as presented in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, it may not be possible to recalculate EPS attributable to Raytheon Company common stockholders by adjusting EPS from continuing
operations by EPS from discontinued operations.  We include all
unvested stock awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, in the number of shares outstanding in our basic and diluted EPS calculations. As a result, we have included all of our
outstanding unvested restricted stock and LTPP awards that meet the retirement eligible criteria in our 
80 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
calculation of basic and diluted EPS. We disclose EPS for common stock and unvested share-based payment awards, and separately disclose distributed and undistributed earnings. Distributed
earnings represent common stock dividends and dividends earned on unvested share-based payment awards of retirement eligible employees. Undistributed earnings represent earnings that were available for distribution but were not distributed. Common
stock and unvested share-based payment awards earn dividends equally, as shown in the table below.  Employee Stock PlansStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the calculated fair value of the award. The expense is recognized over the employees
requisite service period, generally the vesting period of the award. The expense is amortized over the service period using the graded vesting method for our restricted stock and restricted stock units and the straight line amortization method for
our Long-Term Performance Plan LTPP. The related gross excess tax benefit received upon exercise of stock options or vesting of a stock-based award, if any, is reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing activity rather
than an operating activity.  Risks and
UncertaintiesWe provide a wide range of technologically advanced products, services and solutions for principally governmental customers in the U.S. and abroad, and are subject to certain business risks specific to that industry.
Total sales to the U.S. Government, including foreign military sales, were 88% of total net sales in 2010 and 2009 and 87% of total net sales in 2008. Total sales to customers outside the U.S., including foreign military sales through the U.S.
Government, were 23%, 21% and 20% of total net sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Sales to the government may be affected by changes in procurement policies, budget considerations, changing concepts of national defense, political
developments abroad and other factors. 
Note 2: Accounting Standards As described in Note 7: Other Assets, in January 2010, we adopted the required new accounting standards which amend the accounting and disclosure requirements for transfers of financial assets and
consolidation of variable interest entities VIEs. These accounting standards eliminate the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity QSPE and the related exception for applying the consolidation guidance. As a result, on January1,
2010 we consolidated our QSPE, General Aviation Receivables Corporation GARC, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and resulted in:  The removal of our $67 million investment in GARC, previously reported in other assets, net, and  The addition of long and short-term notes receivable, net, of $68 million; current notes payable of $2 million, and an increase in retained earnings of
less than $1 million, net of tax.  Further, the
new accounting standard related to consolidation of VIEs requires an enterprise to perform a qualitative analysis when determining whether or not it must consolidate a VIE. It also requires an enterprise to continuously reassess whether it must
consolidate a VIE. Additionally, it requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprises involvement with VIEs and any significant change in risk exposure due to that involvement, as well as how its involvement with VIEs impacts the
enterprises financial statements. Finally, an enterprise is required to disclose significant judgments and assumptions used to determine whether or not to consolidate a VIE. With the exception of GARC described above, the adoption of this
accounting standard did not change any of our previous consolidation conclusions and thus did not have an effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
Other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after
December31, 2010, are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
Note 3: Acquisitions In
pursuing our business strategies, we acquire and make investments in certain businesses that meet strategic and financial criteria. 
81 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
In 2010, we acquired Trusted Computer Solutions Inc., Technology Associates Inc. and substantially all
of the assets of an Australian company, Compucat Research Pty. Ltd, for a total amount for all three of $152 million in cash, net of cash acquired. These acquisitions enhance our cybersecurity and information assurance capabilities at Intelligence
and Information Systems IIS. In connection with these acquisitions, we recorded $125 million of goodwill, primarily related to expected synergies from combining operations and the value of the existing workforce, and $28 million of intangible
assets, primarily related to technology, trade names and customer relationships with a weighted-average life of five years. 
In 2009, we acquired BBN Technologies Corp. and related entities BBN which enhances our advanced networking, speech and language technologies,
information technologies, sensor systems and cybersecurity at Network Centric Systems NCS for $334 million in cash, net of $22 million of cash acquired, exclusive of retention and management incentive payments. In connection with this acquisition,
we recorded $254 million of goodwill, primarily related to expected synergies from combining operations and the value of the workforce, and $70 million in intangible assets, primarily related to technology, contractual backlog and trade name with a
weighted-average life of eight years.  In 2008, we acquired
Telemus Solutions, Inc. and SI Government Solutions at IIS for a total of $52 million in cash. In connection with these acquisitions, we recorded $39 million of goodwill and $9 million in intangible assets. 
Pro forma financial information has not been provided for these acquisitions
as they are not material either individually or in the aggregate. 
We funded each of the above acquisitions using cash on hand. The operating results of these businesses have been included with our consolidated results as
of the respective closing dates of the acquisitions. The purchase price of these businesses has been allocated to the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. We
completed these acquisitions to enhance our technology and cybersecurity portfolio. Tax deductible goodwill related to these acquisitions totaled $76 million.

Note 4: Discontinued Operations In pursuing our business strategies we have divested certain non-core businesses, investments and assets when appropriate. All residual activity relating to our previously-disposed businesses appears in
discontinued operations.  We retained certain assets and
liabilities of our previously disposed businesses. At December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, we had $41 million and $71 million, respectively, of assets primarily related to our retained interest in general aviation finance receivables
previously sold by Raytheon Aircraft Company Raytheon Aircraft. At December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, we had $113 million and $57 million, respectively, of liabilities primarily related to non-income tax obligations, certain
environmental and product liabilities, various contract obligations and aircraft lease obligations. 
82 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
We also have certain income tax obligations relating to these disposed businesses, which we include in our income tax disclosures. In the fourth quarter of 2010, IRS appeals proceedings failed to
resolve the federal excise tax dispute related to the treatment of monthly management fees, and as a result, the IRS assessed Flight Options for excise taxes. In the divestiture of Flight Options, Raytheon agreed to indemnify Flight Options in the
event Flight Options was assessed and paid these excise taxes. This indemnification obligation gave rise to our retained non-income tax obligation. In 2011, Flight Options paid the assessment and we indemnified Flight Options given our
indemnification obligation. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded a $39 million, net of the federal tax benefit, in discontinued operations. On behalf of Flight Options, we intend to vigorously contest the matter through litigation
and, if successful, we would be entitled to recover substantially all of the amounts paid. We also retained certain U.K. pension assets and obligations for a limited number of U.K. pension plan participants as part of the Raytheon Aircraft sale,
which we include in our pension disclosures.  As further described
in Note 15: Income Taxes, during the year ended December31, 2010, we recorded a $280 million reduction in our unrecognized tax benefits, which included a decrease of $89 million in tax expense from discontinued operations, including interest,
primarily related to our previous disposition of Raytheon Engineers and Constructors REC.

The U.S. Government has title to the assets related to unbilled amounts on contracts that provide progress payments. Unbilled amounts are recorded under
the percentage-of-completion method and are recoverable from the customer upon shipment of the product, presentation of billings or completion of the contract. Included in unbilled at December31, 2010 was $172 million which is expected to be
collected outside of one year.  Billed and unbilled contracts in
process include retentions arising from contractual provisions. At December31, 2010, retentions were $50 million. We anticipate collecting $36 million of these retentions in 2011 and the balance thereafter.

the table above, was $67 million. The underlying aircraft serve as collateral for these accounts receivable.  As previously described in Note 2: Accounting Standards, in January 2010, we consolidated our QSPE, GARC, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and resulted in:
The removal of our $67 million investment in GARC, previously reported in other assets, net, and  The addition of long and short-term notes receivable, net, of $68 million, current notes payable of $2 million, and an increase in retained earnings of

Ownership 2010 2009 Equity method investments Thales-Raytheon Systems Co. Ltd. TRS 50 69 56 Other investments Various 13 11 Total 82 67
In 2001, we formed a joint venture, TRS, which we account for using the equity method. TRS is a system of systems integrator and provides fully customized
solutions through the integration of command and control centers, radars and communication networks. We record our share of the TRS income or loss and other comprehensive income loss as a component of cost of sales and AOCL, respectively. We only
record losses beyond the carrying amount of the investment when we guarantee obligations of the investee or commit to provide the investee further financial support. 
TRS has two major operating subsidiaries, one of which, Thales-Raytheon
Systems Co. LLC TRS LLC, we control and consolidate and is a component of our NCS segment, and the other one, Thales-Raytheon Systems Company S.A.S. TRS SAS, which we account for using the equity method through our investment in TRS.Of the
$69 million investment in TRS, $58 million represents undistributed earnings at December31, 2010.Our consolidated statements of operations includes net income, which represents net income attributable to Raytheon Company and net income
attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries.Our primary noncontrolling interest relates to TRS LLC.TRS LLC formed a joint venture with TRS SAS called Air Command Systems International S.A.S. ACSI, for which TRS LLC
performs work. TRS LLC had $82 million of receivables due from ACSI.  In addition, we have entered into certain joint ventures formed specifically to facilitate a teaming arrangement between two contractors for the benefit of the customer, generally the U.S. Government,
whereby we receive a subcontract from the joint venture in the joint ventures capacity as prime contractor. Accordingly, we record the work we perform for the joint venture as an operating activity. 
Periodically we enter into other equity method investments which are not
related to our core operations. We record the income or loss from these investments as a component of other income expense. We only record losses beyond the carrying amount of the investment when we guarantee obligations of the investee or commit
to provide the investee further financial support. 
85 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED  Note 8: Derivative Financial Instruments Our primary market exposures are to interest rates and foreign exchange rates and we use certain derivative financial instruments to help manage these exposures.

2010 2009 Gain loss recognized in net sales 1 Gain loss recognized in cost of sales 4 4
In October 2010, we issued $20 billion of fixed rate long-term debt with maturities ranging from 5 to 30 years. In conjunction with the debt issuance, we
entered into interest rate lock agreements with a total notional value of $1,550 million to manage interest rate risk, which resulted in an increase to AOCL of $8 million to be amortized over the term of the debt issued. As of December31,
2010, the above referenced interest rate locks were closed out. 
In the fourth quarter of 2010, we exercised our right to call and repurchased $678 million of our long-term debt due in 2012 and 2013 that was previously
hedged with the interest rate swaps, described below. The remaining unamortized gain resulting from the early termination of the interest rate swaps of $15 million was recorded as a reduction to interest expense. In the first quarter of 2009 we
terminated our interest rate swaps and collected cash of $37 million related to the early termination. In 2009, we recorded $16 million of income as a reduction to interest expense related to the amortization of the gain on the termination of our
interest rate swaps, including $6 million of accelerated amortization related to the 485% Notes due 2011 which we repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2009. There were no interest rate swaps outstanding at December31, 2010 and
December31, 2009.

Buy amounts represent the U.S.Dollar equivalent of commitments to purchase foreign currencies and sell amounts represent the U.S.Dollar
equivalent of commitments to sell foreign currencies. Foreign currency forward contracts that do not involve U.S. Dollars have been converted to U.S. Dollars for disclosure purposes.  Foreign currency forward contracts, used to fix the dollar value of specific commitments and payments to international vendors
and the value of foreign currency denominated receipts, have maturities at various dates through 2020 as follows: $791 million in 2011, $274 million in 2012, $94 million in 2013, $40 million in 2014 and $59 million thereafter. 
Our foreign currency forward contracts contain off-set, or netting
provisions, to mitigate credit risk in the event of counterparty default, including payment default and cross default. At December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, these netting provisions effectively reduced our exposure to approximately
$4 million and $35 million, respectively, which is spread across numerous highly rated counterparties. 
Note 9: Fair Value Measurements The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, approximates the carrying value due to their short maturities. The estimated fair value of notes receivable
approximates the carrying value based principally on their underlying interest rates and terms, maturities, collateral and credit status of the receivables. The carrying value of long-term debt of $3,610 million and $2,329 million at
December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, respectively, was recorded at amortized cost. The estimated fair value of long-term debt of approximately $3,783 million and $2,581 million at December31, 2010 and December31, 2009,
respectively, was based on quoted market prices.  We did not have
any significant nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities that would be recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis as of December31, 2010 and December31, 2009. 
We did not have any transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and
Level 2 of the fair value measurement hierarchy during the year ended December31, 2010 and December31, 2009. 
The following tables set forth the financial assets and liabilities that we measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value
hierarchy. We classify assets and liabilities measured at fair value in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement.

The notes and debentures
are redeemable by the Company at any time at redemption prices based on U.S. Treasury rates.  In the fourth quarter of 2010, we received proceeds of $1,975 million for the issuance of $20 billion fixed rate long-term debt and exercised our call rights to repurchase, at prices based on fixed
spreads to U.S. Treasuries, $678 million of our long-term debt due in 2012 and 2013 at a loss of $73 million pretax, $47 million after-tax, which is included in other income expense.  In the fourth quarter of 2009, we received proceeds of $496 million for the issuance of $500 million fixed rate long-term debt
and exercised our call rights to repurchase, at prices based on fixed spreads to U.S. Treasuries, $474 million of our long-term debt due 2011 at a loss of $22 million pretax, $14 million after-tax, which is included in other income expense.
We periodically enter into various interest rate swaps that
correspond to a portion of our fixed-rate debt in order to effectively hedge interest rate risk. In the fourth quarter of 2010, as a result of the repurchase of debt described above, we recorded $15 million of income as a reduction to interest
expense resulting from the accelerated amortization of the interest rate swaps terminated in 2009, described below. In the first quarter of 2009, we terminated our interest rate swaps and collected cash of $37 million related to the early
termination. In 2009, we recorded $16 million of income as a reduction to interest expense related to the amortization of the gain on the termination of our interest rate swaps, including $6 million of accelerated amortization related to the 485%
Notes due 2011 which we repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2009.

In November 2010, we entered into a $500 million revolving credit facility maturing in 2012, replacing the previous $500 million 364-day facility, which
matured in November 2010. Under the facility we can borrow and backstop commercial paper.  We also have a $10 billion facility maturing in November 2012, $150 million of which is available to Raytheon United Kingdom Limited, our U.K. subsidiary. Under the facility we can borrow, issue letters
of credit and backstop commercial paper.  Borrowings under these
facilities bear interest at various rate options, including LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit default swap spread, with minimum and maximum margins that are adjusted for our credit ratings. Based on our credit ratings at December 31, 2010,
borrowings under the $10 billion and $500 million facilities would bear interest at LIBOR

plus 100 basis points and 75 basis points, respectively, the minimum margin. The credit facilities are comprised of commitments from approximately 25 separate highly rated lenders, each
committing no more than 10% of the aggregate of the facilities. As of December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, there were no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities or our previous credit facilities. However, we had $3 million
and $21 million of outstanding letters of credit at December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, respectively, which effectively reduced our borrowing capacity under these credit facilities and our previous credit facility by those same
amounts.  Under the current and previous credit facilities, we
must comply with certain covenants, including a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no more than 50% and a ratio of consolidated earnings attributable to Raytheon Company before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to
consolidated net interest expense, for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, of no less than 3 to 1. We were in compliance with these covenants during 2010 and 2009. Our ratio of total debt to total capitalization, as defined in the
current and previous credit facilities, was 267% and 190% at December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, respectively. We are providing these ratios, which are financial covenants under our current credit facilities, as these metrics are
used by our lenders to monitor the Companys leverage and debt service capacity and are also thresholds that limit our ability to utilize these two facilities. 
Certain of our foreign subsidiaries maintain revolving bank lines of credit
to provide them with a limited amount of short-term liquidity, including the $150 million Raytheon United Kingdom Limited facility described above. In addition, other uncommitted bank lines totaled approximately $2 million and $15 million at
December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, respectively. There were no amounts outstanding under these lines of credit at December31, 2010 and December31, 2009. Compensating balance arrangements are not material. 
Total cash paid for interest on notes payable and long-term debt was $134
million, $147 million and $142 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 
Note 11: Commitments and Contingencies At December31, 2010, we had commitments under long-term leases requiring annual rentals on a net lease basis as follows: In millions 2011 254 2012 207 2013 156 2014 118 2015 96 Thereafter 385
Rent expense was $307 million, $290 million and $285 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In the normal course of business, we lease equipment,
office buildings and other facilities under leases that include standard escalation clauses for adjusting rent payments to reflect changes in price indices, as well as renewal options.  At December31, 2010, we had commitments under agreements to outsource a portion of our information technology function,
which have no minimum annual payments.  Insurance is purchased from third parties to cover aggregate liability exposure up to $15 billion. 
Environmental MattersWe are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to remediation of various environmental sites.
Our estimate of the liability of total environmental remediation costs includes the use of a discount rate and considers that a portion of these costs is eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S.
Government. We consider such recovery probable based on government contracting regulations and our long history of receiving reimbursement for such costs and accordingly have recorded the estimated future recovery
90 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
of these costs from the U.S. Government within contracts in process. Our estimates of total remediation costs, weighted average risk-free rate, total remediation costsdiscounted and

We also lease certain government-owned properties and are generally not liable for remediation of preexisting environmental contamination at these sites;
as a result, we generally do not reflect the provision for these costs in our consolidated financial statements.  Due to the complexity of environmental laws and regulations, the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup methods and technologies, the uncertainty of insurance coverage and the unresolved
extent of our responsibility, it is difficult to determine the ultimate outcome of environmental matters; however, we do not expect any additional liability to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or
liquidity. Environmental

Financing Arrangements and OtherWe issue guarantees and banks and surety companies issue, on our behalf, letters of credit and surety bonds
to meet various bid, performance, warranty, retention and advance payment obligations of us or our affiliates. These instruments expire on various dates through 2020. Additional guarantees of project performance for which there is no stated value
also remain outstanding. The stated values outstanding consisted of the following at December31, 2010 and December31, 2009:  In millions
2010 2009 Guarantees 281 227 Letters of Credit 1,067 898 Surety Bonds 213 203
Included in guarantees and letters of credit described above were $134 million and $256 million, respectively, at December31, 2010, and $80
million and $206 million, respectively, at December31, 2009, related to our joint venture in TRS. We provide these guarantees and letters of credit to TRS and other affiliates to assist these entities in obtaining financing on more
favorable terms, making bids on contracts and performing their contractual obligations. While we expect these entities to satisfy their loans, project performance and other contractual obligations, their failure to do so may result in a future
obligation to us. At December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, we had an estimated liability of $9 million and $6 million, respectively, related to these guarantees and letters of credit. We periodically evaluate the risk of TRS and other
affiliates failing to satisfy their loans, project performance and meet other contractual obligations described above. At December31, 2010, we believe the risk that TRS and other affiliates will not be able to perform or meet their obligations
is minimal for the foreseeable future based on their current financial condition. All obligations were current at December31, 2010.

Our residual turbo-prop
commuter aircraft portfolio has exposure to outstanding financing arrangements with the aircraft serving as collateral. We have sold and leased commuter aircraft globally to thinly capitalized companies, whose financial condition could be
significantly affected by a number of factors, including fuel and other costs, the availability of credit, industry consolidation, declining commercial aviation market conditions and the U.S. Government budget for the Essential Air Service program.
Based on recent economic trends, including tightening credit markets and volatile fuel costs, these companies may increasingly experience difficulties meeting their financial commitments. At December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, our
exposure on commuter aircraft assets held as inventory, collateral on notes or as leased assets, was approximately $68 million relating to 77 aircraft and approximately $109 million relating to 106 aircraft, respectively. The carrying value of our
commuter aircraft portfolio assumes an orderly disposition of these assets, consistent with our historical experience and strategy. The tightening of credit markets and economic conditions have reduced the number of potential buyers who are able to
obtain financing and have negatively impacted the ability of existing customers to refinance their aircraft through a third party. If the long-term market prospects for these aircraft were to significantly erode or cease, our valuation of these
assets would likely be less than the carrying value. We periodically evaluate potential alternative strategies for the disposal of these assets. If we were to dispose of these assets in an other than orderly manner or sell the portfolio in its
entirety, the value realized would likely be less than the carrying value.  In 1997, we provided a first loss guarantee of $133 million on $13 billion of U.S. Export-Import Bank loans maturing in 2015 to the Brazilian Government related to Network Centric Systems System
for the Vigilance of the Amazon SIVAM program. Loan repayments by the Brazilian Government were current at December31, 2010. 
We have entered into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products
and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be
satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties e.g., our vendors of supplies
from in-country vendors. These agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, building or leasing facilities for
in-country operations and making investments in local ventures. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on
negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. Offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to
perform in accordance with offset requirements. We have historically not been required to pay any such penalties.  Government contractors are subject to many levels of audit and investigation. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Contract Management Agency,
the Inspector General of the Department of Defense and other departments and agencies, the Government Accountability Office, the Department of Justice and Congressional Committees. The Department of Justice has, from time to time, convened grand
juries to investigate possible irregularities by us. We also provide products and services to customers outside of the U.S. and those sales are subject to local government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices. Our compliance with
such local government regulations or any applicable U.S. Government regulations e.g., the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations may also be investigated or audited. We do not expect these audits and
investigations to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, either individually or in the aggregate. 
We are currently conducting a self-initiated internal review of certain of our international operations, focusing on compliance with the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act. In the course of the review, we have identified several possible areas of concern relating to payments made in connection with certain international operations related to a jurisdiction where we do business. We have voluntarily
contacted the SEC and the Department of Justice to advise both agencies that an internal review is underway. Because the internal review is ongoing, we cannot predict the ultimate consequences of the
92 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
review. Based on the information available to date, we do not believe that the results of this review will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.  In May 2006, international arbitration hearings
commenced against us as the successor to the Hughes Electronics defense business, in connection with certain claims brought in 2004 by MBDA relating to an alleged 1995 Workshare Agreement. The asserted claims involve breach of contract, intellectual
property infringement and other related matters. The arbitration panel stayed further proceedings, including the issuance of the liability decision on the non-IP claims presented during the May 2006 hearing, while the parties engaged in settlement
efforts. The parties were unable to conclude an enforceable settlement, and in August 2009, the panel released its liability decision, rejecting some of MBDAs non-IP claims, while finding Raytheon liable for some other non-IP claims. We did
not record any significant additional financial liability as a result of our estimate of the impact of the decision. The proceedings will now resume to determine liability for the asserted IP claims and to assess overall damages, if any. At this
point, we are unable to estimate a range of potential loss, if any, because the IP claims are vague, discovery is in process, and any potential damages involve complex, technical matters subject to interpretation by the arbitration panel. We believe
that we have meritorious defenses to the asserted IP claims and intend to continue to contest them vigorously; however, an adverse resolution of this matter could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
On July22, 2010, Raytheon Systems Limited RSL
was notified by the UK Border Agency that it had been terminated for cause on a program. The termination notice included allegations that RSL had failed to perform on certain key milestones and other matters in addition to claims to recover certain
losses incurred and previous payments made to RSL. We believe that RSL performed well and delivered substantial capabilities to the UK Border Agency under the program, which has been operating successfully and providing actionable information since
live operations began in May 2009. On July29, 2010, RSL filed a dispute notice on the grounds that the termination by the UK Border Agency was not valid. On August18, 2010, the UK Border Agency initiated arbitration proceedings on this
issue. We expect the arbitration procedures to commence in the first half of 2011. We intend to pursue vigorously the collection of receivables for the program and damages in connection with the termination and defend ourselves against the UK Border
Agencys claims for losses and previous payments.  As a
result of the termination notice, we adjusted our estimated amount of revenue and costs under the program in the second quarter of 2010. The adjustment was based on our determination that certain assets were no longer expected to be recovered and
for estimated costs for certain exit cost obligations under the contract and the estimated settlement of expected future subcontractor claims. The impact of the adjustment reduced Intelligence and Information Systems total net sales and
operating income by $316 million and $395 million, respectively, for the year ended December31, 2010. At December31, 2010, we had approximately $80 million in letters of credit and approximately $70 million of receivables and other
assets remaining under the program for technology and services delivered, which we believe, are probable of recovery in litigation or arbitration. No amounts have been drawn down on the letters of credit. We currently do not believe it is probable
that we are liable for losses, previous payments or other claims asserted by the UK Border Agency. Due to the inherent uncertainties in litigation and arbitration as noted above, and the complexity and technical nature of potential claims and
counterclaims, as well as the resolution of the related matters involving subcontractors, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate amount of any resolution of the termination could be less or greater than our estimate and at this time, we are
unable to estimate a range of the potential difference in such amounts, if any. If we are unsuccessful in recovering amounts drawn on the letters of credit, if any, fail to collect the receivable balance, are required to make payments against claims
or other losses asserted by the UK Border Agency or pay subcontractor claims in excess of our estimates made in connection with the adjustment in the second quarter of 2010 described above, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.  In addition,
various other claims and legal proceedings generally incidental to the normal course of business are pending or threatened against us. We do not expect any additional liability from these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
Product WarrantyWe provide for product warranties in conjunction with certain product sales for which we recognize revenue upon delivery.

Warrants to purchase
53million, 120 million and 120million shares of our common stock that expire in June 2011, with an exercise price of $3750 per share, were outstanding and included in our calculations of diluted EPS at December31,
2010,December, 31, 2009 and December31, 2008, respectively.  In 2008, we adopted the required new accounting standards that require us to recognize liabilities for the existing postretirement benefit aspects of our current split-dollar life insurance arrangements.
The cumulative effect of adopting these new standards resulted in a $16 million charge to retained earnings as of January1, 2008. We did not grant any new or expanded benefits as a result of this change.  Note 13: Stock-based Compensation Plans We recorded $128 million, $127 million and $122 million of expense related to stock-based compensation in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We recorded $43 million, $42 million and $43 million as a tax
benefit related to stock-based compensation in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December31, 2010, there was $160 million of compensation expense related to nonvested awards not yet recognized which is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 16 years.  At December31, 2010,
we had stock-based compensation awards outstanding under a number of stock plans, including our 2010 Stock Plan. Future grants of awards will be made from the 2010 Stock Plan and not from our prior plans. 
Shares issued as a result of stock awards, stock option exercises or
conversion of restricted stock unit awards will be funded through treasury stock or the issuance of new shares. Of the 418million shares authorized under our stock plans, there were 119million shares available for awards under such
plans as of December31, 2010.  Restricted Stock 
The 2010 Stock Plan provides for the award of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights to our employees, officers,
nonemployee directors and consultants. Awards of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights generally are made by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors MDCC and are
compensatory in nature. These awards vest over a specified period of time as determined by the MDCC, generally four years for employee awards and one year for nonemployee directors. Restricted stock awards entitle the recipient to full dividend and
voting rights beginning on the date of grant. Non-vested shares are restricted as to disposition and subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances. At the date of award each share of restricted stock is credited to common stock at par value. The
fair value of restricted stock, calculated under the intrinsic value method at the date of award, is charged to income as compensation expense over the vesting period with a corresponding credit to additional paid-in capital.

Long-Term Performance Plan In 2004, we established the LTPP, which provides for restricted stock unit awards granted from our stock plans to our senior leadership. These awards vest at the end of a three-year performance cycle
based upon the achievement of specific pre-established levels of performance.  The performance goals for the three outstanding performance cycles at December31, 2010, which are independent of each other, are based on three metrics as defined in the award agreements: return on
invested capital ROIC, weighted at 50%, total shareholder return TSR relative to a peer group, weighted at 25%; and cumulative free cash flow CFCF, weighted at 25%. 
The ultimate award, which is determined at the end of each of the three-year
performance cycles, can range from zero to 200% of the target award and also includes dividend equivalents, which are not included in the table below. Compensation expense for the awards is recognized over the performance period based upon the value
determined under the intrinsic value method for the CFCF and ROIC portions of the award and the Monte Carlo simulation method for the TSR portion of the award using historic volatility. Compensation expense for the CFCF and ROIC portions of the
awards will be adjusted based upon the expected achievement of those performance goals.  LTPP activity related to the expected units was as follows:  Unit amounts in thousands

Note 14: Pension and Other Employee Benefits We have pension plans covering the majority of our employees, including certain employees in foreign countries Pension Benefits. Our primary pension obligations relate to our domestic IRS qualified
pension plans. We also provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to retired employees and to eligible employees upon retirement through other postretirement benefit plans Other Benefits. 
The fair value of plan assets for our domestic and foreign Pension Benefit
plans was $14,502 million and $597 million at December31, 2010, respectively, and $12,294 million and $545 million at December31, 2009, respectively. 
98 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
We maintain a defined contribution plan that includes a 401k plan. Covered employees hired or rehired
after January1, 2007, are eligible for a Company contribution based on age and service, instead of participating in our pension plans. These and other covered employees are eligible to contribute up to a specific percentage of their pay to the
401k plan. The Company matches the employees contribution, generally up to 3% or 4% of the employees pay, which is invested in the same way as employee contributions. Total expense for the Company match was $275 million, $269 million
and $238 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  At
December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, there was $112 billion and $103 billion invested in our defined contribution plan, respectively. At December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, $11 billion and $14 billion of this was
invested in the Company stock fund, respectively.  We also
maintain additional contractual pension benefits agreements for certain of our executive officers. The liability was $32 million and $31 million at December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, respectively. 
Contributions and Benefit Payments 
We make both discretionary and required contributions to our pension plans. Required contributions were primarily determined under the ERISA and are
affected by the actual return on plan assets and plan funded status through December31, 2010.  We made required contributions of $1,183 million, $1,160 million and $542 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. We expect to make required
contributions of $1,073 million and $21 million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, respectively, in 2011. We made discretionary contributions of $750 million in 2010 and $660 million in 2008. We did not make any discretionary
contributions in 2009. We will continue to periodically evaluate whether to make additional discretionary contributions. 
The table below reflects the total Pension Benefits expected to be paid from the plans or from our assets, including both our share of the benefit cost
and the participants share of the cost, which is funded by participant contributions. Other Benefit payments reflect our portion only.  In millions

For our domestic qualified pension plans the projected benefit obligation PBO, accumulated benefit obligation ABO and asset values for these plans
were $17,847 million, $15,997 million, and $14,502 million, respectively, as of December31, 2010 and $16,260 million, $14,599 million, and $12,294 million, respectively, as of December31, 2009. The PBO represents the present value of
Pension Benefits earned through the end of the year, with allowance for future salary increases. The ABO is similar to the PBO, but does not provide for future salary increases. 
The PBO and fair value of plan assets for Pension Benefits plans with PBOs in
excess of plan assets were $17,897 million and $13,756 million, respectively, at December31, 2010, and $16,270 million and $11,558 million, respectively, at December31, 2009.  The ABO and fair value of plan assets for Pension Benefits plans with ABOs in excess of plan assets were $15,920 million and
$13,710 million, respectively, at December31, 2010 and $14,511 million and $11,525 million, respectively, at December31, 2009. The ABO for all Pension Benefits plans was $17,170 million and $15,675 million at December31, 2010 and

The discount rate for our domestic Pension Benefits plans was 575% and 625%
at December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, respectively. Our foreign Pension Benefits plan assumptions have been included in the Pension Benefits assumptions in the table above. 
102 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
The long-term rate of return on plan assets ROA represents the average rate of earnings expected over
the long term on the assets invested to provide for anticipated future benefit payment obligations. The Company employs a building block approach in determining the long-term ROA assumption. Historical markets are studied and
long-term relationships between equities and fixed income are assessed. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. The long-term ROA assumption is also
established giving consideration to investment diversification, rebalancing and active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed periodically to assess reasonableness and appropriateness. 
In validating the 2010 long-term ROA assumption, we reviewed our pension plan
asset performance since 1986. Our average actual annual rate of return since 1986 has exceeded our estimated 875% assumed return. Based upon these analyses and our internal investing targets, we determined our long-term ROA assumption for our
domestic pension plans in 2010 was 875%, consistent with our 2009 assumption. Our domestic pension plans actual rates of return were approximately 11%, 17% and 26%for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The difference between the
actual rate of return and our long-term ROA assumption is included in deferred losses. If we significantly change our long-term investment allocation or strategy, then our long-term ROA assumption could change. 
The long-term ROA assumptions for foreign Pension Benefits plans are based on
the asset allocations and the economic environment prevailing in the locations where the Pension Benefits plans reside. Foreign pension assets do not make up a significant portion of the total assets for all of our Pension Benefits plans.
The effect of a 1% increase or decrease in the assumed health
care trend rate for each future year for the aggregate of service cost and interest cost is $1 million or $1 million, respectively, and for the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is $11 million or $10 million, respectively.
Plan Assets Substantially all our domestic Pension Benefit Plan plan assets, which consists of investments in equity securities, fixed-income securities, cash and cash equivalents, public real estate securities,
private real estate funds and hedge funds and other assets such as investments in private equity funds, are held in a master trust, which was established for the investment of assets of our Company sponsored retirement plans. The assets of the
master trust are overseen by the Companys Investment Committee comprised of members of senior management drawn from appropriate diversified levels of the executive management team.  The Investment Committee is responsible for setting the policy that provides the framework for management of the Plan assets.
In accordance with its responsibilities and charter, the Investment Committee meets on a regular basis to review the performance of the Plan assets and compliance with the investment policy. The policy sets forth an investment structure for managing
Plan assets, including setting the asset allocation ranges, which are expected to provide an appropriate level of overall diversification and total investment return over the long term while maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay the benefits of
the Plan. Asset allocation ranges are set to produce the highest return on investment taking into account investment risks that are prudent and reasonable given prevailing market conditions. In developing the asset allocation ranges, third party
asset allocation studies are periodically performed that consider the current and expected positions of the plan assets and funded status. Based on this study and other appropriate information, the Investment Committee establishes asset allocation
ranges taking into account acceptable risk targets and associated returns.  The investment policy asset allocation ranges for the Plan, as set by the Investment Committee, for the year ended December31, 2010 were as follows: Asset Category U.S. equities 25%-40 International equities 15%-30 Fixed-income securities 25%-40 Cash and cash equivalents 3%-15 Other including private equity and real estate 0%-20  103 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
The Investment Committee appoints the investment fiduciary, who is responsible for making investment
decisions within the framework of the Investment Policy and for supervising the internal pension investment team. The pension investment team is comprised of experienced financial managers, who are all employees of the Company. The investment
fiduciary reports back to the Investment Committee. During times of unusual market conditions, the investment fiduciary may seek authorization from the Investment Committee to change the investing allocation ranges to prevent excessive volatility or
other undesirable consequences.  Taking into account the asset
allocation ranges, the investment fiduciary determines the specific allocation of the Plans investments within various asset classes. The Plan utilizes select investment strategies which are executed through separate account or fund structures
with external investment managers who demonstrate experience and expertise in the appropriate asset classes and styles. The selection of investment managers is done with careful evaluation of all aspects of performance and risk, due diligence of
internal operations and controls, reputation, systems evaluation and a review of investment managers policies and processes. The Plan also utilizes unleveraged exchange traded funds that track an index and highly liquid short term instruments.
Investment performance is monitored frequently against appropriate benchmarks and tracked to compliance guidelines with the assistance of third party performance evaluation tools and metrics.  Consistent with the objective of maximizing return while minimizing risk, multiple investment strategies are employed to
diversify risk such that no single investment or manager holding presents a significant exposure to the total investment portfolio. Plan assets are invested in numerous diversified strategies with the intent to minimize correlations. This allows for
diversification of returns. As of December31, 2010, no individual investment strategy represented more than 5% of the total assets of the Plan. Further, within each strategy, guidelines are established which set forth the list of authorized
investments, the typical portfolio characteristics and diversification required by limiting the amount that can be invested by sector, country and issuer. As a result, the Plan is not significantly exposed to any single entity, investment manager,
sector or international location.  The Plans investments are
stated at fair value. Investments in equity securities common and preferred are valued at the last reported sales price when an active market exists. Investments in fixed-income securities are generally valued using methods based upon market
transactions for comparable securities and various relationships between securities which are generally recognized by institutional traders. Investments in private equity funds, hedge funds and private real estate funds are estimated at fair market
value which primarily utilizes net asset values reported by the investment manager. The pension investment team reviews independently appraised values, audited financial statements and additional pricing information to evaluate the net asset values.
For the very limited group of securities and other assets for which market quotations are not readily available or for which the above valuation procedures are deemed not to reflect fair value, additional information is obtained from the investment
manager and evaluated internally to determine whether any adjustments are required to reflect fair value.

U.S. and International equity securities primarily include investments across the capitalization spectrum of large, medium and small market capitalization stocks. 2
Hedge funds can employ numerous strategies and seek to hedge some of the risk inherent in their investments by using a variety of methods, including short selling and
derivative instruments. 3
Investment grade bonds are fixed-income securities with a rating equivalent to a Standard Poors rating of BBB- or better. Non-investment grade bonds have an
equivalent rating of BB+ or less. 4
Core fixed income investments are strategies that invest primarily in intermediate-term high quality domestic bonds. 5
Global multi-sector fixed income investments are strategies that invest globally among several sectors including governments, investment grade corporate bonds, high
yield corporate bonds and emerging market bonds. 6
As of December31, 2010, cash and cash equivalents were invested in a highly liquid money market fund and other short term instruments, including treasuries,
agencies, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. As of December31, 2009, cash and cash equivalents were predominantly held in a highly liquid short term investment fund. Fund investments at December31, 2009 were primarily short
term direct treasury instruments, including treasuries, agencies, treasury backed commercial paper and treasury collateralized overnight repurchase agreements. Included in cash and cash equivalents is excess cash in investment manager accounts. This
cash is available for immediate use and is used to fund daily operations and execute the investment policy. This amount is not considered to be part of the cash target allocation set forth in the investment policy. 7
Multi-asset class investments are long-only balanced strategies that invest across multiple asset classes including equities, fixed income and commodities utilizing a
risk-balanced approach. 8
Investments in private equity funds are predominantly invested in U.S. and Western Europe private equity funds. 9
The Plan participates in a securities lending program with the Trustee. The program allows the Trustee to loan securities, which are assets of the Plan, to approved
brokers the Borrowers. The Trustee requires Borrowers, pursuant to a security loan agreement, to deliver collateral to secure each loan. The Plan bears the risk of loss with respect to the unfavorable change in fair value of the
invested cash collateral. The market value of securities on loan is reflected in the various asset categories above. Loaned securities were predominantly U.S. equities, International equities, corporate bonds and U.S. Government bonds or treasuries.
Cash collateral obligations of $95 million and $233 million were received for securities on loan as of December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, respectively. Cash collateral was invested in a separately maintained and managed cash
collateral investment account, which was primarily invested in investment grade bonds and is reflected in the assets above.

The actual return on plan assets for assets still held at December31, 2010 and December31, 2009 was $52 million and $14 million, respectively.
The Plan limits the use of derivatives through
direct or separate account investments such that the derivatives used are liquid and able to be readily valued in the market. Derivative usage in separate account structures is limited to hedging purposes or to gain market exposure in a
non-speculative manner. The fair market value of the Plans derivatives through direct or separate account investments was less than $1 million and $2 million as of December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, respectively. 
In addition, assets are held in trust for non-U.S. Pension Benefits plans,
primarily in the U.K. and Canada which are governed locally in accordance with specific jurisdictional requirements. These assets are overseen by local management in Canada and by trustees with a combination of members representing plan participants
and local management in the U.K. Investments in the non-U.S. Pension Benefits plans consist primarily of fixed-income securities and equity securities and had a fair market value of $597 million and $545 million at December31, 2010 and
December31, 2009, respectively.

These investments are valued using quoted prices in active markets Level 1 as well as significant observable inputs Level 2. Investments with significant unobservable inputs Level 3 are
immaterial in the non-U.S. Pension Benefits plans.  The fair
market value of assets related to our Other Benefits was $433 million and $407 million as of December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, respectively. These assets included $186 million and $171 million at December31, 2010 and
December31, 2009, respectively, that were invested in the master trust described above and are therefore invested in the same assets described above. The remaining investments are held within Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association
VEBA trusts. The assets of the VEBAs are also overseen by the Investment Committee and managed by the same investment fiduciary that manages the master trusts investments with a separate team. These assets are generally invested in domestic
fixed-income securities as well as U.S. equities. These investments are valued primarily using quoted prices in active markets Level 1 as well as significant observable inputs Level 2. There were no Level 3 investments in the VEBAs at

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IRS examinations of our
tax returns have been completed through 2005 and the IRS is currently examining the 2006-2008 tax years. Additionally, we are under audit by multiple state and foreign tax authorities. State tax liabilities are routinely adjusted to account for any
changes in federal taxable income.  Domestic income from
continuing operations before taxes was $2,699 million, $2,806 million and $2,360 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and foreign income loss from continuing operations before taxes was $267 million, $124 million and $162 million in
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. No provision has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as these earnings have been indefinitely reinvested. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax
liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable. Total federal and foreign tax payments, net of refunds and credits, were $337 million, $208 million and $448 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 
We believe that our income tax reserves are adequate; however, amounts
asserted by taxing authorities could be greater or less than amounts accrued and reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. Accordingly, we could record adjustments to the amounts for federal, foreign and state tax-related liabilities in the
future as we revise estimates or we settle or otherwise resolve the underlying matters.  The balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2010, exclusive of interest, was $188 million which would affect earnings if recognized. The balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,
2009, exclusive of interest, was $469 million, of which $364 million would affect earnings if recognized.  In 2010, we received final approval from the IRS and the U.S. Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation of the IRS examination of our tax returns for the 1998-2005 tax years Tax Settlement. As a
result, we recorded a reduction in our unrecognized tax benefits from continuing and discontinued operations of $280 million, which decreased our tax expense by $259 million, including $170 million from continuing operations and $89 million from
discontinued operations. The decrease in tax expense included $56 million related to interest.  In addition, we filed an accounting method change related to the timing of certain compensation deductions with the IRS. As a result, we recorded a reduction in our unrecognized tax benefits from
continuing operations of $104 million, which decreased tax expense by $13 million related to interest.  We accrue interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. Primarily as a result of the Tax Settlement in 2010, we recorded $90 million of income related to interest which, net of the federal
tax expense was $57 million. In the twelve months ended December31, 2009 and December31, 2008, respectively, we recorded $27 million and $26 million of interest which, net of the federal tax benefit was $17 million in 2009 and 2008,
respectively. At December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, we had $33 million and $123 million, respectively, of interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits, which, net of the federal tax benefit, was approximately $23 million and
$80 million, respectively. In the ordinary course of business, we may take new tax positions that could increase or decrease our unrecognized tax benefits in future periods. 
A rollforward of our unrecognized tax benefits was as follows: In millions

We generally account for our state income tax expense as a deferred contract cost, as we can generally
recover this expense through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government. We include this deferred contract cost in contracts in process until allocated to our contracts, which generally occurs upon payment or when otherwise
agreed as allocable with the U.S. Government. Net state income tax expense allocated to our contracts was $59 million, $25 million and $122 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We include state income tax expense allocated to our contracts
in administrative and selling expenses.  The American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 provides a deduction for income derived from qualifying domestic production activities the Domestic Manufacturing Deduction under Section199 of the Internal Revenue Code IRC that is phased in over the 20052010
period. The deduction was equal to 9% of qualified income in 2010, and 6% in 2009 and 2008.  In December 2010, the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 was enacted. This legislation retroactively reinstated the research and development tax credit for
2010 and extended it through December31, 2011. As a result, we recorded a benefit of approximately $26 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 representing the benefit of the research and development tax credit for the full year. 
Deferred income taxes consisted of the following at December31:

As of December31, 2010, we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $450 million, of which $440 million was generated in the
United Kingdom. We believe that we will have sufficient taxable income to realize this deferred tax asset, as any net operating loss generated in the United Kingdom may be carried forward indefinitely. 
The federal tax benefit expense related to discontinued operations was
$110 million, $1 million and $7 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

We must calculate our
pension costs under both FAS requirements under GAAP and CAS. GAAP outlines the methodology used to determine pension expense or income for financial reporting purposes, which is not indicative of the funding requirements for pension plans that we
determine by other factors. CAS prescribes the allocation to and recovery of pension costs on U.S. Government contracts. The results of each segment only include pension expense as determined under CAS. The CAS requirements for pension costs and its
calculation methodology differ from the FAS requirements and calculation methodology. As a result, while both FAS and CAS use long-term assumptions in their calculation methodologies, each method results in different calculated amounts of pension
cost. The FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment, which we report as a separate line item in our segment results above, represents the difference between our pension expense or income under FAS requirements under GAAP and our pension expense under CAS.

During the second quarter 2010, RSL was notified by the UK Border Agency that it had been terminated for default on a program. The impact of the adjustment reduced IIS
total net sales and operating income by $316 million and $395 million in the second quarter and the six months ended June27, 2010, respectively. 4
During the third quarter 2010, we received final approval from the IRS and the U.S. Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation of the Tax Settlement. As a result, we
recorded a reduction in our unrecognized tax benefits from continuing and discontinued operations of $280 million, which decreased our tax expense by $259 million, including $170 million from continuing operations and $89 million from discontinued
operations. The decrease in tax expense included $56 million related to interest. 5
During the fourth quarter of 2010, we received proceeds of $1,975 million for the issuance of $20 billion fixed rate long-term debt and exercised our call rights to
repurchase, at prices based on fixed spreads to U.S. Treasuries, $678 million of our long-term debt due in 2012 and 2013 at a loss of $73 million pretax, $47 million after-tax, which is included in other income expense. 6
During the fourth quarter of 2009, we received proceeds of $496 million for the issuance of $500 million fixed rate long-term debt and exercised our call rights to
repurchase, at prices based on fixed spreads to U.S. Treasuries, $474 million of our long-term debt due in 2011 at a loss of $22 million pretax, $14 million after-tax, which is included in other income expense. 
Note 18: Subsequent Events 
We have evaluated subsequent events through the time of filing this Annual
Report on Form 10-K with the SEC.  On January 31, 2011, we
completed the acquisition of Applied Signal Technology, Inc. AST, pursuant to a definitive agreement dated December 18, 2010. We paid $3800 per share of AST for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $500 million, net of cash received.
Following the acquisition, AST was renamed Raytheon Applied Signal Technology, Inc. and will be integrated into our SAS segment and is expected to enhance SASs capabilities across the full spectrum of integrated sensor solutions for classified
and other government customers.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
Management has conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of December31, 2010. 
Conclusion of EvaluationBased on this evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2010 were effective.  
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of ControlsIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes
that any control, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.  Evaluation of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is set forth in Part II, Item8 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.  Attestation Report of the Independent
Registered Public Accounting FirmThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report which is set forth in Part II, Item8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2010 that have materially affected or
are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.  Subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2010, our Technical Services segment migrated to the Companys common Enterprise Resource Planning ERP systems.
