INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Steel Dynamics, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Steel
Dynamics, Inc. the Company as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Steel Dynamics, Inc. as of
December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their operations and thier cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. S/ Deloitte & Touche LLP DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and Iron Dynamics, Inc., IDI a wholly-owned subsidiary. All
significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition
The Company records sales upon shipment and provides an allowance for estimated
costs associated with returns.
Business
The Company, formed on September 7, 1993, operates in two industry segments and
operates a thin-slab cast steel mini-mill in the Midwest, with the capacity to
produce 22 million tons annually of hot-rolled steel coils and can further
process hot-rolled steel coils into galvanized and cold-rolled products. IDI
operates a scrap steel substitute producing facility with the capacity to
produce 500,000 tons of liquid pig iron annually. The Company products are
sold primarily to the automotive, tubing, construction and commercial equipment
industries.
Cash
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Restricted cash consists
of cash held by a trustee in a debt service fund for the repayment of principal
and interest on the Company municipal bond.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or
market.                           DECEMBER 31,

Finished goods..     14,057     12,795
$126,706    $ 60,163
Derivatives
The Company has only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments
and does not use them for trading purposes. The Company entered into an interest
rate swap agreement as a means of hedging its interest rate exposure on certain
of its debt facilities. The interest rate swap is accounted for under the
accrual method. Under this method, the differential to be paid or received under
the interest rate swap agreement is recognized as interest expense over the term
of the hedged obligation. Changes in market value of the interest swap are
accounted for under the accrual method and are not reflected in the accompanying
financial statements.
Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition which includes
capitalized interest on construction-in-progress of $60 million, $81 million
and $10 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Depreciation is provided
using the units-of-production method for manufacturing plant and equipment and
using the straight-line method for non-manufacturing equipment over the
estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 12 years to 30 years. Repairs
and maintenance are expensed                    28

as incurred. The Company recorded proceeds received from state and local
government grants and other capital cost reimbursements as reductions of the
related capital assets.
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be
recoverable.
Debt Issuance Costs
The costs related to the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized to interest
expense using an effective interest method over the terms of the related debt.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, short-term
investments and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash with high
quality financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure from any
one institution. Generally, the Company does not require collateral or other
security to support customer receivables.
Foreign Currency Transactions
Transaction gains and losses incurred by the Company for equipment purchases
denominated in a foreign currency are recorded in results of operations
currently.
Earnings loss Per Share

basic and diluted earnings per share computations                          YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

Options to purchase 668,853 shares and 106,628 shares of common stock at prices
ranging from approximately $17 to $27 and $23 to $27 per share were outstanding
at December 31, 1998, and 1997, respectively, but were not included in the
computation of diluted EPS because the options' exercise prices were greater
than the average market price of the common shares.
New Accounting Pronouncements
On January 1, 1998 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 131 SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information which changes the way public companies report
information about segments of their business in their annual financial
statements and requires them to report selected segment information in their
quarterly reports issued to shareholders. SFAS No. 131 also requires entity-wide
disclosures about the products and services an                    29

entity provides, the material countries in which it holds assets and reports
revenues, and its major customer. The adoption of SFAS No. 131 did not affect
results of operations or financial position or cash flows, but did affect the
disclosure for segment information See Note 10.
Statement of Financial Standards No. 133 SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, was issued in June 1998 and is
effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15,
1999. This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments and for hedging activities. It requires that an entity
recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of
financial condition and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain
conditions are met a derivative may be specifically designated as a fair value
hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a hedge of foreign currency exposure. The
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative that is, gains and
losses depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting
designation. Management has not yet quantified the effect, if any, of the new
standard on the financial statements.

DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS term loan amortizable in equal quarterly installments during the final two years
of the five-year term loan period, and a $1000 million term loan payable in
equal quarterly installments during two years ending September 30, 2004.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the
Company assets other than as permitted to be excluded in order to secure the
financing for IDI.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at floating rates. The
Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of
$1000 million pursuant to which the Company has agreed to make fixed rate
payments at 6935% and will receive LIBOR payments. The maturity date of the
interest rate swap agreement is July 2, 2001. The counterparty has the right to
extend the maturity date to July 2, 2004 at predetermined interest rates.
IDI has a $650 million Credit Agreement with a group of banks which consists of
a $100 million three-year revolving credit facility subject to a borrowing
base and a $550 million eight-year senior term loan facility. The IDI Credit
Agreement had $550 million outstanding under the senior term facility and $50
million outstanding under the revolving credit facility, as of December 31,
1998. IDI is required to pay a commitment fee ranging from 125% to 375%
annually depending upon the period of time and the principal amount of the
unused borrowing capacity. The IDI Credit Agreement requires IDI to maintain
certain covenants, the most restrictive of which are requirements to maintain a
minimum tangible net worth, a minimum fixed charge service coverage ratio, and a
maximum negative earnings before income taxes, depreciation, and amortization.
Additionally, the IDI Credit Agreement limits the indebtedness of IDI, limits
capital expenditures and restricts the payment of dividends by IDI.
In 1995 the Company borrowed $214 million through a state government municipal
bond program, of which $31 million and $30 million, as of December 31, 1998
and 1997, respectively, are held by a trustee in a debt service reserve fund and
are recorded as restricted cash. At December 31, 1998 and 1997, a stand-by
letter of credit of $220 million relating to the municipal bonds was
outstanding.
In November 1998 the Company borrowed $100 million through a state government
municipal bond program, of which $100 million are held by a trustee in a debt
service reserve fund until the bond proceeds are utilized on approved
expenditures and as such are recorded as restricted cash, at December 31, 1998.
The electric utility transmission facility loan of $73 million and $75 million
at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively, represents the Company portion of
the cost of the transmission facilities constructed and owned by the utility to
service the Company site. The corresponding cost is included in other assets
and is being amortized over twenty years on the straight-line basis.
The electric utility loan of $122 million and $128 million at December 31,
1998 and 1997, respectively, represents amounts loaned to finance the Company
portion of the cost of the Company substation constructed on site. Interest
and principal payments are made equally on a monthly basis in an amount
necessary to repay the loan fifteen years from the date of commencement of
operations.
IDI entered into an electric utility transmission facility agreement on October
12, 1998. This agreement provides a $65 million eight-year loan, secured by a
portion of IDI electrical equipment. At December 31, 1998, there was $51
million outstanding under the loan.
The Credit Agreement, electric utility loan and transmission facility loan
require the Company to maintain certain covenants, the most restrictive of which
are requirements to maintain tangible net worth of at least $1870 million plus
50% of cumulative net income, a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest
coverage ratio. The Credit Agreement also limits the indebtedness of the
Company, limits capital expenditures and investments and places restrictions on
the amount of dividends that can be paid.
The other equipment obligation represents deferred payments for the purchase of
certain equipment. The obligation is non-interest bearing and was discounted at
7% over a term of five years.
In June 1994 the Company entered into an agreement with respect to senior
subordinated promissory notes Subordinated Notes in the aggregate principal
amount of $55 million and warrants to purchase up to 1,641,827 shares of Class A
common stock at an exercise price which was less than $001 per share. The
Subordinated Notes were repaid in November 1996 with a portion of the proceeds
from the initial public offering. An extraordinary loss on the prepayment of the
Subordinated Notes in the amount of $73 million was recorded in 1996 and was
comprised of the write off of the unamortized discount, write off of the
financing costs associated with the Subordinated Notes and a prepayment penalty.                    31

As a result of substantial modifications with the amendment to the Credit
Agreement in 1997 the Company incurred an extraordinary loss of approximately
$76 million net of a tax benefit of approximately $51 million related to
prepayment penalties and the write off of the capitalized financing costs
associated with the originally negotiated credit facility.
Cash paid for interest was $246 million, $138 million, and $260 million for
the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary file a consolidated federal income
tax return. Cash paid for taxes was $175 million, $87 million and zero, for
the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Included in cash
paid for taxes for the year ended December 31, 1998 is a $30 million foreign
withholding tax payment, which is expected to be utilized as a foreign tax
credit on the Company federal income tax return. The current and deferred
income tax expense before extraordinary loss is as follows                          YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

Deferred income tax provision..    10,030    862
Total income tax provision..   $20,942   $ 7,813
The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 1996 would have
resulted in a net deferred tax benefit, however, this benefit was offset
entirely by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance was reversed during
1997, the result of which reduced the effective income tax rate for the year.
The reversal of the valuation allowance was due to the Company current
profitability and future projected profitability.

The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated fair value as
of December 31, 1998 and 1997, because of the relatively short maturity of these
instruments. The carrying value of long-term debt, including the current
portion, approximated fair value as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was estimated to be $93
million and $62 million at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The fair
values are estimated by the use of quoted market prices, estimates obtained from
brokers, and other appropriate valuation techniques based on references
available.

The Company sponsors a 401k retirement saving plan 401k Plan for all
eligible employees of the Company under which they may elect to contribute on a
pre-tax basis up to 8% of their eligible compensation. The Company provides
matching contributions equal to 5% of the participants' contributions. Employer
contributions are not significant for any periods presented. The 401k Plan was
amended effective in 1997 to provide for a matching contribution that will be
dependent upon the Company return on assets. In no event will the match be
less than 5% or greater than 50% of employee contributions.
The Company has also established a Profit Sharing Plan Profit Sharing Plan,
for eligible employees. The Profit Sharing Plan is a qualified plan for
federal income tax purposes. Each year, the Company allocates an amount equal to
5% of the Company pre-tax profits to a profit sharing pool. The profit
sharing pool is used to fund the Profit Sharing Plan as well as a separate cash
profit sharing bonus which is paid to employees in March of the following year.
The allocation between the Profit Sharing Plan contribution and the cash bonus
amount is determined by the Board of Directors each year. The amount allocated
to the Profit Sharing Plan is subject to a maximum legally established
percentage of compensation paid to participants.                    36
