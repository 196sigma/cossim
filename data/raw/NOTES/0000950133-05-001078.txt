64 MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. the Company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under
the supervision of the Companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected
by the Companys Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is supported by written policies and
procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the Companys transactions and dispositions of the Companys assets; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the
consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of the Companys management and directors; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys
assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In connection with the preparation of the Companys annual consolidated financial statements,
management has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
the COSO Framework. Managements assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those
controls. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that as of December31, 2004, the Companys
internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Companys
consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, have issued an attestation report
on managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting, a copy of which appears on
the next page of this Annual Report. March14, 2005 s/

Chief Financial Officer 65 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Sunrise Senior Living, Inc.s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Sunrise Senior Living, Inc.
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria. 66 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. as of
December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31,

responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight

audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the

significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Organization and Presentation Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. Sunrise is a provider of senior living services, with operations in
the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Founded in 1981, Sunrise began with a
simple but innovative vision to create an alternative senior living option that would emphasize
quality of life and quality of care. At December31, 2004, Sunrise operated 380 open communities,
including 367 communities in the United States, 10 communities in Canada and three communities in
the United Kingdom, with a total resident capacity of approximately 43,100. Sunrise communities
offer a full range of personalized senior living services, from independent living, to assisted
living, to care for individuals with Alzheimers and other forms of memory loss, to nursing and
rehabilitative care. Sunrise also develops senior living communities for itself, for joint
ventures in which it retains an ownership interest and for third parties. Sunrise was incorporated in Delaware on December14, 1994. The consolidated financial statements
include Sunrises wholly owned subsidiaries that manage, own and develop senior living properties. 2. Significant Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents Sunrise considers cash and cash equivalents to include currency on hand, demand deposits, and all
highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase. Due from Affiliates Due from affiliates
represents reimbursements due from joint ventures for
development costs advanced, including development fees, operating costs paid on behalf of
affiliates, including payroll and insurance costs, and management fees. Development costs are
reimbursed when third party financing is obtained by the affiliate. Operating costs are generally
reimbursed within thirty days. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Sunrise provides an allowance for doubtful accounts on its outstanding receivables based on its
collection history. Details of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable are as follows in

Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost and include interest and property taxes capitalized on
long-term construction projects during the construction period, as well as other costs directly
related to the development and construction of properties. Maintenance and repairs are charged to
expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the related assets. Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or circumstances indicate that the assets undiscounted expected cash flows are not
sufficient to recover its carrying amount. No impairment charge was required in 2004, 2003, and
2002. Construction in progress includes pre-acquisition costs and other direct costs related to
acquisition, development and construction of properties, including certain direct and indirect
costs of a development subsidiary. If a project is abandoned, any costs previously capitalized are
expensed. Assets Held For Sale Sunrise considers assets to be held for sale when management approves and commits to a formal plan
to actively market a property for sale and when other required criteria are met. Upon designation
as an asset held for sale, Sunrise records the carrying value of each property at the lower of its
carrying value or its estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell, and stops recording
depreciation expense. Sunrise had two properties held for sale at December31, 2004 with a
combined book value of $10million, which is included in property and
equipment. Liabilities associated with these properties were not material at December31, 2004. Intangible Assets Under FASB Statement No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and intangible assets
deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized, but are subject to periodic impairment
tests. Intangible assets relate primarily to the acquisition of Marriott Senior Living Services MSLS
and Karrington Health, Inc. in 2003 and 1999, respectively, and are comprised of management
contracts, leaseholds, and costs in excess of assets acquired. Costs in excess of assets acquired
represent costs of business acquisitions in excess of the fair value of identifiable net assets
acquired. Management contracts and leaseholds are amortized using the straight-line method over
the remaining contract term, ranging from 1 to 28years. Sunrise conducts its annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets in
the fourth quarter. Based on the results of this review, no impairment charge was required in
2004, 2003, and 2002. The carrying amounts of management contracts and leaseholds are reviewed for
impairment when indicators of impairment are identified. If the carrying amount of the assets
exceeds the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining amortization periods, the carrying amount
will be adjusted. 74 Self-Insurance Programs Sunrise is self insured for certain levels of property, liability, workers compensation and
employee medical coverage. Sunrise accrues estimated costs of these self-insurance programs at the
present value of projected settlements for known and incurred but not reported claims. Deferred Financing Costs Costs incurred in connection with obtaining permanent financing for Sunrise-owned properties are
deferred and amortized over the term of the financing on a straight-line basis, which approximates
the effective interest method. Investments in Unconsolidated Senior Living Properties Sunrise owned non-controlling interests in 151 senior living properties at December31, 2004, 26 of
which were under development. Sunrises interests, through limited liability companies and
partnerships, generally range from 7% to 50%. Sunrise has one property in which it owned less than
10%, 121 properties in which it owned between 10% and 20%, nine properties in which it owned
between 21% and 30%, and 20 properties in which it owned more than 30%. Sunrise does not control these entities and is not the primary beneficiary, as major business
decisions require approval by the other majority partners or members. Accordingly, these
investments are accounted for under the equity method. The investments are recorded at cost and
subsequently are adjusted for equity in net income lossesand cash contributions and
distributions. Sunrise recognizes profits on sales of services to these entities to the extent of the ventures
outside ownership interest. Differences between the carrying value of investments and the
underlying equity in net assets of the investee, excluding goodwill, are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the underlying properties. See Note 14 for
information on commitments or contingencies of partnerships or limited liability companies in which
Sunrise is a general partner or managing member. Sunrises underlying equity in net assets of the investees exceeded the carrying value of
investments in the net assets of unconsolidated senior living properties by $52million at December
31, 2004. Derivatives and Hedging Activities Sunrise recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a
derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging
relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments
that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, Sunrise must designate the hedging
instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as either a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge,
or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. 75 For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge i.e., hedging the
exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk,
the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported on the balance
sheet and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged
transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or
loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future
cash flows of the hedged item, if any, is recognized in current earnings during the period of
change. Sunrise had no derivative instruments at December31, 2004 and 2003. Revenue Recognition Operating revenue consists of management services revenue and resident fee revenue. Management
services revenue is comprised of revenue from management contracts, development contracts and
facility contract services. Base management fees are recognized in the month they are earned in
accordance with the terms of the management contract. Incentive management fees are recognized as
revenue in addition to the base management fee in accordance with the contracts. Revenue from
development contracts is recognized over the term of the respective development contracts using the
percentage-of-completion method. The cost-to-cost method is used to measure the extent of progress
toward completion and calculate the percentage of completion based on the costs incurred to date
compared to the expected total costs for the development contract. Revenue from facility contract
services is comprised of reimbursable expenses of properties operated with Sunrises employees
under long-term operating agreements and is recognized when services are rendered. Resident fee
revenue is recognized monthly as services are rendered. Agreements with residents are generally
for a term of one year and are cancelable by residents with thirty days notice. Income from Property Sales Income from property sales is recognized upon consummation of the sale of properties, unless a
portion of the sale is contingent upon future events or performance. Deferred gains are recognized
upon performance or resolution of the contingency. Stock-Based Compensation Stock options are granted for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to
the fair value of the shares at the date of grant. Sunrise accounts for stock based compensation
using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, and accordingly, does not recognize
compensation expense for stock option grants. In addition, Sunrise grants restricted stock to
officers and other key executives. These grants vest over one to ten years. Unvested amounts are
reflected in the consolidated balance sheet and represent the fair value of shares at the date of
grant, which is amortized as compensation expense over the period of vesting. Had compensation cost for stock based compensation been determined consistent with FASB Statement
No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123, Sunrises net income and earnings
per share would have been impacted as follows 76

The fair value of each option grant was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions for 2004, 2003 and 2002: risk-free interest
rate yield of 35% to 54%; dividend of 0%; expected lives of 4 to 10years; and volatility of
4867% to 5320%. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the
expected stock price volatility. Because Sunrises employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in managements opinion, the existing
models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock
options. In December2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Statement No123 revised
2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R. SFAS
123R supersedes APB 25 and amends FASB
Statement No95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement
based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. Sunrise will adopt
SFAS 123R on July1, 2005. Sunrise believes the 2005 impact of adopting the new standard will be
approximately $30million of compensation expense based on its current share based compensation
plan and a mid-year adoption. Continuing Care Agreements Residents of the Lifecare Communities are required to sign a continuing care agreement Care
Agreement with Sunrise. The Care Agreements stipulate, among other things, the amount of all
entry fees and monthly fees, the type of residential unit being provided, and Sunrises obligation
to provide both health care and non-health care services. In addition, the Care Agreements provide
Sunrise with the right to increase future monthly fees. The Care Agreements are terminated upon the
receipt of a written termination notice from the resident or the death of the resident. When the present value of estimated costs to be incurred under Care Agreements exceeds estimated
revenues, the present value of such excess costs are accrued currently. The calculation assumes a
future increase in the monthly revenue commensurate with the monthly cost. The calculation
currently results in an expected positive net present value cash flow and, as such, no liability
has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 77 The components of the entry fees for lifecare communities are recorded as Other Liabilities within
the consolidated balance sheets and include   
a.
Lifecare Obligations This component is refundable to the resident or the
residents estate upon termination or cancellation of the Care Agreement. Lifecare
obligations are primarily non-interest bearing and, depending on the type of plan, are
equal to either 100, 95, 90 or 50percent of the total entry fee less any additional
occupant lifecare fees. As these obligations are considered security deposits,
interest is not imputed on these obligations in accordance with APB 21, Interest on
Receivables and Payables. Lifecare obligations amount to $26million and $25million
at December31, 2004, and 2003 respectively. None of these refundable advance fees
are amortized into income.     
b.
Additional Occupant Lifecare Fees This is a nonrefundable fee for each
additional occupant in a residential unit. These nonrefundable fees are recorded as
deferred revenues and amortized into income using the straight-line method over the
residents or couples actuarial life, adjusted annually.     
c.
Lifecare Fees This component is nonrefundable and equals the total entry fee
less the two components described in a. and b. above. These nonrefundable fees are
recorded as deferred revenues and amortized into income using the straight-line method
over the residents or couples actuarial life, adjusted annually. Third Party Reimbursements A portion of the revenues from health care services is attributable to patients whose bills are
paid by Medicare or Medicaid under contractual arrangements. Medicare reimburses costs based on a
Prospective Payment System PPS for most of the communities. PPS does not require a provision
for estimated Medicare and Medicaid settlements. There are no receivables for estimated
third-party payer settlements at December31, 2004 or 2003. The healthcare industry is subject to
numerous laws and regulations of federal, state and local governments. While no material regulatory
inquiries have been made, compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future
government review and interpretation as well as regulatory actions unknown or unasserted at this
time. Foreign Currency Translation Foreign currency balance sheet accounts are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange
in effect at year-end. The related translation adjustments are made directly to accumulated other
comprehensive income. Income and expenses are translated at average monthly rates of exchange in
effect during the year. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net
income. Variable Interest Entities On February1, 2003, Sunrise adopted FASB Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities FIN 46. Under FIN 46, companies are required to determine if they are the primary
beneficiary of a variable interest entity. If they are the primary beneficiary, the variable
interest entity 78 must be consolidated. All companies with variable interests in variable interest
entities created after January31, 2003 were required to apply the provisions of FIN 46 as of the
date the entity was created immediately. Public companies with calendar year-end quarters with a
variable interest in a variable interest entity created before February1, 2003 were required to
apply the provisions of FIN 46 at March31, 2004. Sunrises joint ventures fall into one of three categories. First, Sunrise enters into development
joint ventures whereby a third-party investor and Sunrise capitalize a joint venture to develop and
operate senior living communities. Second, Sunrise and a third-party investor capitalize a joint
venture to acquire an existing senior living property. Finally, as a part of Sunrises sale
long-term manage back program, Sunrise sells owned properties into a joint venture in which it
holds a minority interest that is capitalized by a third-party investor. These partnerships obtain
non-recourse third-party debt. Sunrise generally does not have future requirements to contribute
additional capital beyond the original capital commitments. All three types of joint ventures are
established as real estate partnerships to own the underlying property. Sunrise will then enter
into a long-term management contract to operate the property on behalf of the joint venture.
Sunrises total investment in these joint ventures is comprised of its direct capital investment in
these joint ventures and, when agreed to, subordinated debt provided and other advances. At
December31, 2004, this total investment was $170million not including any guarantees provided to
these joint ventures as described in Note 14. The realization of this investment is dependent upon
the ongoing operations of the joint ventures. See Note 7 for the operating results of the joint
ventures. At December31, 2004, there are eight joint ventures in which Sunrise had an interest that are
variable interest entities under FIN 46. Five of the variable interest entities are development
joint ventures, which were established between 1999 and 2004 and contain a total of three operating
properties and 15 properties under development. One of the variable interest entities is an
operating joint venture formed in 2000. The other variable interest entity is a sale/long-term
manage back joint venture that contains a total of 28 operating properties. The final variable
interest entity is a newly formed joint venture that contains five operating properties
recapitalized from a development venture, nine operating properties recapitalized from a
sale/manage back venture and two operating properties that were previously wholly owned by Sunrise.
Sunrise is not considered the primary beneficiary for any of these joint ventures and therefore,
continues to account for these investments under the equity method of accounting. Sunrises
maximum exposure from these eight entities was $80million at December31, 2004. Reclassifications Certain 2003 and 2002 balances have been reclassified to conform with the 2004 presentation. Income from Property Sales Sunrise has reclassified income from property sales from operating revenues and is now reflecting
income from property sales as other income. These amounts remain a component of income from
operations. In order to provide comparable cash flows from core operating activities, Sunrise has reclassified
all property sale cash flows from operating activities to the investing activities section of the
cash flow statement. Accordingly, certain amounts within investing activities have been
reclassified from the prior period presentation. The impact to the cash flow statement for the
years ended 2003 and 2002 was a reclassification of approximately $40million and $68million,
respectively, from operating cash flows to investing cash flows. 79 Lifecare Obligations Lifecare obligations, the component of entry fees for lifecare communities, which are refundable to
the resident or the residents estate upon termination or cancellation of the care agreement, have
been reclassified from Current and Long-term Debt to Other Liabilities at December31, 2003. These
obligations are primarily non-interest bearing and are considered security deposits, rather than
debt. Lifecare obligations were $26million and $25million at December31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Priority Return Income Income received from four joint ventures for priority returns previously recorded in Management
Services Revenue has been reclassified in 2003 and 2002 to a component of Equity in Earnings of
Unconsolidated Senior Living Properties. These amounts totaled $5million, $4million, and $4
million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Sunrise has also reclassified priority returns and distributions from changes in other assets and
other liabilities in operating activities to distributions from investments in the investing
activities section of the cash flow. Total distributions and priority returns were $15million 10million and $6million in 2004, 2003, and 2002 respectively. 3. Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets Prepaid expenses and other current assets consist of the following in thousands

In January2002, Sunrise issued and sold $125million aggregate principal amount of 51/4% convertible
subordinated notes due February1, 2009. The convertible notes bear interest at 51/4% per annum
payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 each year beginning on August1, 2002. The
conversion price is $3584 equivalent to a conversion rate of 279018 shares per $1,000 principal
amount of the convertible notes. The notes are subordinated to Sunrises existing and future
senior indebtedness. During 2003, Sunrise repurchased $5million principal amount of the
convertible notes. The convertible notes are redeemable at Sunrises option commencing February5,
2006, at specified premiums. The holders of the convertible notes may require Sunrise to
repurchase the convertible notes upon a change of control of Sunrise as defined in the convertible
notes. During the third quarter of 2003, Sunrise closed on a $200million corporate credit facility with a
syndicate of banks. The corporate credit facility provides for both cash borrowings and letters of
credit. It has an initial term of three years with an extension option. Cash borrowings accrue
interest at LIBOR plus 175% to 300% or the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 050% and Prime
plus 025% to 150%. LIBOR-based borrowings have fixed interest periods of one, two, three or six
months. Letters of credit fees are equal to 200% of the maximum available to be drawn on the
letters of credit. Borrowings are used for general corporate purposes including investments,
acquisitions and the refinancing of existing debt. Consistent with Sunrises transformation to a
management services company, the credit facility is not secured by real estate and replaced a $265
million syndicated revolving credit facility. Sunrise pays commitment fees of 025% to 045% on
the unused balance of the credit facility. There were $18million of cash advances and $39million
of letters of credit outstanding under this credit facility at December31, 2004. The cash
advances accrued interest at 423% at December31, 2004. The letters of credit have been pledged
primarily for the benefit of certain municipalities and insurance companies and were unused at
December31, 2004. The letters of credit issued under the corporate credit facility expire within
two years. At December31, 2004, Sunrise had an additional $6million in unused letters of credit that were
issued by other lending institutions. The letters of credit were pledged for the benefit of a
municipality and a lending institution and expire within one year. 86 In November2001, Sunrise entered into a $60million revolving credit facility, expandable to $100
million. The revolving credit facility matures in November2006, is subject to a five-year
extension, accrues interest at LIBOR plus 120% 366% at December31, 2004 and is collateralized
by senior living properties. The revolving credit facility may be converted to a fixed rate
facility at any time during the term. Sunrise pays commitment fees of 013% on the unused portion
of the credit facility. In September2003, Sunrise reduced its revolving credit facility to $16
million. At December31, 2004, the collateral of the revolving credit facility consisted of two
properties and $8million was outstanding. In December2002, Sunrise entered into an $18million revolving credit facility. The revolving
credit facility matured in January2005, accrued interest at LIBOR plus 250% 506% at December
31, 2004 and was collateralized by senior living properties. In June2003, Sunrise reduced its
revolving credit facility to $11million due to the sale of one property that served as collateral.
At December31, 2004, the collateral of the revolving credit facility consisted of seven
properties and no amounts were outstanding. In December2002, Sunrise received a commitment for a $17million credit facility. The credit
facility matured in February2005, was subject to a one-year
extension, accrued interest at LIBOR
plus 325% 565% at December31, 2004 subject to a minimum of
575% and was collateralized by
three senior living properties. In June2003, Sunrise reduced its revolving credit facility to $2
million due to the sale of two properties that served as collateral. At December31, 2004, the
collateral of the revolving credit facility consisted of one property and no amounts were
outstanding. In December2002, Sunrise received commitments for mortgages on two senior living properties for an
aggregate amount of $16million. The mortgages were scheduled to mature in January2005 and were
subject to a one-year extension. Interest accrued at LIBOR plus 250% and the mortgages were
cross-collateralized by two senior living properties. In September2003, Sunrise reduced its
revolving credit facility to $9million due to the sale of one property that served as collateral.
In September2004, the line was terminated. In June2003, Sunrise entered into a $2million revolving line of credit secured by two senior
living properties. The line of credit matured in January2005,
accrued interest at LIBOR plus
250% 506% at December31, 2004 and was cross-collateralized with the $18million revolving
credit facility entered into in December2002. At December31, 2004, no amounts were outstanding. The other mortgages and notes payable relate primarily to 9 properties whereby outstanding balances
are collateralized by the total assets of the respective property. Payments of principal and
interest are made monthly. Interest rates range from 300% to 1000% with remaining maturities
ranging from less than one year to 22years. These other mortgages and notes payable have total
borrowings of $46million at December31, 2004. During 2001, Sunrise entered into five interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted
$125million of its variable LIBOR based syndicated revolving credit facility to a fixed-rate
basis. The maturity dates of the swap agreements ranged from June2003 to June2004. In December2002,
Sunrise paid $400,000 to terminate one of the five interest rate swap agreements. In 2003, Sunrise
paid $3million to terminate the remaining four interest rate swap agreements. For the year ended
December31, 2003, Sunrise recognized $2million in interest expense related to the amortization of
the swap balance in 87 accumulated other comprehensive income. Sunrise also wrote off $2million of
the swap balance in accumulated other comprehensive income as debt associated with the swap was
repaid as part of the property sale transactions closed in the second and third quarters of 2003.
At December31, 2004 and 2003, Sunrise had a zero balance in accumulated other comprehensive income
related to the terminated swap agreements. There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in Sunrises debt instruments,
including provisions that: 1require Sunrise to meet certain financial tests for example, the
$200million line of credit requires Sunrise not to exceed certain leverage ratios, to maintain
certain fixed charge coverage ratios and to have a consolidated net worth of at least $387million
as adjusted each quarter and to meet other financial ratios; 2require consent for changes in
Sunrises control; and 3restrict Sunrise and its subsidiaries ability to borrow additional
funds, dispose of all or substantially all assets, or engage in mergers or other business combinations in which Sunrise is not the surviving entity, without lender consent. At December31,
2004, Sunrise was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. Principal maturities of long-term debt at December31, 2004 are as follows in thousands

to employees, directors, consultants and advisors. At December31, 2004, these plans provided for
the grant of options to purchase up to 9,898,910 shares of common stock. The option exercise price

granted. On April25, 1996, the Board of Directors adopted the 1996 Directors Stock Option Plan the
Directors Plan. Any director who was a member of the Board of Directors but not an officer or

the Rights Agreement and the Distribution Date as defined below have rights attached to them.
The rights expire ten years after adoption of the Rights Agreement. Each right, when exercisable,
entitles the holder to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of SeriesC Junior Participating
Preferred Stock at a price of $8500 the Purchase Price. Until a right is exercised, the
holder thereof will have no rights as a stockholder of Sunrise. The rights initially attach to the common stock. The rights will separate from the common stock
and a distribution of rights certificates will occur a Distribution Date upon the earlier of
1ten days following a public announcement that a person or group an Acquiring Person has
acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding
shares of common stock the Stock Acquisition Date or 2ten business days or such later date
as the Board of Directors may determine following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange
offer, the consummation of 90 which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person of 20% or
more of the outstanding shares of common stock. However, neither Paul J. Klaassen nor Teresa M.
Klaassen nor their affiliates, associates and estates, each of whom, as of the date of adoption
of the Rights Agreement, beneficially owned in excess of 20% of the outstanding shares of common
stock, will be deemed an Acquiring Person, unless they acquire an additional 2% of the common
stock which was outstanding at the time of completion of Sunrises initial public offering. In general, if a person becomes the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the then outstanding shares
of common stock, each holder of a right may exercise the right by purchasing common stock having a
value equal to two times the Purchase Price. If at any time following the Stock Acquisition Date
1Sunrise is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction in which it is not
the surviving corporation other than a merger which follows an offer described in the preceding
paragraph, or 250% or more of Sunrises assets or earning power is sold or transferred, each
holder of a right shall have the right to receive, upon exercise, common stock of the acquiring
company having a value equal to two times the Purchase Price. The Board of Directors of Sunrise
generally may redeem the rights at a price of $005 per right at any time until ten days after an
Acquiring Person has been identified as such. 11. Net Income Per Common Share The following table summarizes the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share

International, Inc.s wholly owned subsidiary, MSLS, which owns and operates senior independent
full-service and assisted living properties. Sunrise paid approximately $92million in cash to
acquire all of the outstanding stock of MSLS. Sunrise also assumed approximately $48million of
working capital liabilities and other funding obligations as well as approximately $25million of
life care endowment obligations, the majority of which are expected to be refinanced with proceeds
from the issuance of new endowment obligations as new residents enter the communities. Operations
of MSLS are included in the consolidated statements of income from March28, 2003 to December31,
2004. The acquisition of MSLS was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the purchase
price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair
values. The initial purchase price was allocated to assets acquired, including separately
identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed based on current valuations of assets and
liabilities. Certain valuations are subject to adjustment as contingencies are resolved and
additional information on certain estimates becomes available. Net working capital deficit was
adjusted by approximately $5million, costs in excess of assets acquired and transaction costs were
adjusted by approximately $2million each and land was adjusted by approximately $1million during
2003 as additional information was obtained or finalization of working capital balances were
determined. In 2004, costs in excess of assets acquired was adjusted by approximately $18million
as a result of true-ups of working capital. The purchase price values assigned to the major assets
and liabilities were as follows   
Management contracts and leases, net
$63million   Land
$22million   Life care endowment obligations
$25million   Net working capital deficit and other
$48million   Costs in excess of assets acquired
$91million   Transaction costs
$12million The portion of the purchase price allocated to management contracts and leases will be amortized
into expense over the specific term of each individual management contract and lease acquired
ranging from two to 29years. Sunrise also assumed certain guarantees of MSLS and Marriott International, Inc.
in the acquisition. See Note 14 for a description of those guarantees. The year ended December
31, 2003 includes $11million in transition expenses related to this acquisition which have been
reflected in general and administrative expenses. The following unaudited pro forma information presents the results of operations of Sunrise for the
years ended December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, as if the acquisition of MSLS had taken place
at January1, 2002. 92

In June2003, Sunrise acquired the remaining majority interest, ranging from 50 to 81percent, in
seven senior living properties in which it previously maintained a minority ownership interest.
The majority interest holder was a not-for-profit entity. In order to acquire the remaining
ownership interest, Sunrise assumed approximately $21million in debt and paid approximately $2
million in cash. These properties were previously accounted for using the equity method of
accounting. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Sunrise
allocated its current investment carrying value and purchase price to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. The initial purchase price values assigned to the major assets and
liabilities are $35million for property, $5million for land, $3million for furniture, fixtures
and equipment, and $21million for debt. The results of operations for these properties are
reflected in Sunrises consolidated financial statements from June30, 2003 forward. The
acquisition of these interests was immaterial to the pro forma results. 13. Dispositions In 2000, Sunrise announced its intention to sell selected owned properties as a normal part of its
operations and retain long-term management contracts and, in many cases, minority equity interests
in the properties. Sunrise has performed under its sale/long-term manage back program by selling
some properties 100% to third-parties and retaining a long-term management contract and selling
some properties to joint ventures in which Sunrise has a minority ownership interest, generally
ranging from 10% to 25%. If Sunrise sells 100% of a property to a third-party owner, Sunrise
recognizes a gain from the sale for the difference between the purchase price and the book value of
the property, less the costs to sell. Sunrise also removes the book value of the property from the
Property and equipment line item on the consolidated balance sheet and removes from liabilities
any debt repaid or assumed by the new owner in the transaction. If Sunrise sells a property to a
joint venture in which it has a minority ownership interest, Sunrise will recognize as a gain from
the sale the difference between the purchase price and the book value of the property, less the
costs to sell, adjusted to reflect only the gain associated with the third-party ownership in the
joint venture. Sunrise does not record a gain on the portion of the sale associated with its
remaining ownership in the joint venture. Sunrise also records, at historical cost basis, its remaining ownership of the property sold and debt assumed by the joint venture as an
investment. In December2000, Sunrise completed the sale of two properties for an aggregate sales price of $28
million. Sunrise realized $9million in gain, subject to certain contingencies being met, of which
$1million, $5million and $2million were recognized in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Sunrise continues to operate the properties under long-term operating agreements. In February2001, Sunrise completed the sale of nine properties for an aggregate sales price of
$131million to a limited partnership in which Sunrise owns a 25% interest. Sunrise realized $41
million in 93 gain, subject to certain contingencies being met, of which $1million and $40million
was recognized during 2002 and 2001, respectively. Sunrise continues to operate the properties
under long-term operating agreements. In March2002, Sunrise completed the sale/long-term manage back of 12 assisted living properties to
a real estate investment entity in which Sunrise owns a 20% interest. Sunrise realized $43million
in gain, subject to certain operating contingencies being met, of which $43million was recognized
during 2002. Sunrise will continue to operate the properties under long-term management
agreements. In June2002, Sunrise completed the sale/long-term manage back of two assisted living properties to
a real estate joint venture in which Sunrise owns a 20% interest. Sunrise realized $9million in

long-term management agreement. In September2002, Sunrise completed the sale/long-term manage back of two assisted living
properties to a real estate joint venture in which Sunrise owns a 20% interest. Sunrise realized
$8million in gain, subject to meeting certain operating contingencies, of which $4million and $4
million was recognized in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Sunrise will continue to operate the
properties under a long-term management agreement. In December2002, Sunrise completed the sale/long-term manage back of 11 assisted living properties
to a real estate joint venture in which Sunrise owns a 20% interest. Sunrise realized $36million
in gain, subject to meeting certain operating contingencies, of which $27million and $9million
was recognized in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Sunrise will continue to operate the properties
under a long-term management agreement. In March2003, Sunrise completed the sale/long-term manage back of its 100% interest in 10 assisted
living properties to a not-for-profit family foundation for an aggregate sales price of $19
million. As part of the sale, Sunrise provided $5million of seller financing. Sunrise realized
$10million in gain, subject to certain contingencies being met, of which $5million was recognized in 2003. During 2003,
Sunrise started to recognize portions of the remaining $5million gain contingent on the repayment
of the seller financing and the remaining amount was recognized in 2004 upon sale of the note.
Sunrise continues to operate the properties under long-term management agreements. In June2003, Sunrise completed the sale of 12 consolidated senior living properties and 11 Sunrise
joint venture senior living properties. The properties were sold in two separate transactions to
two ventures in which Sunrise has a ten percent interest. The aggregate purchase price for the 12
consolidated senior living properties was $167million and $144million for the 11 Sunrise joint
venture senior living properties. Sunrise realized a $30million gain from the sale of the 12
consolidated senior living 94 properties, subject to meeting certain operating and financing
contingencies, of which $9million and $21million was recognized in 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The sale of the 11 Sunrise joint venture properties from the original joint venture investor to the
new joint venture investor did not result in any income statement impact to Sunrise, however, it
did provide for the repayment to Sunrise of all outstanding notes receivable and advances from the
existing joint ventures, which approximated $46million. Sunrise will continue to operate all 23
properties under long-term management contracts. In September2003, Sunrise completed the sale/long-term manage back of five consolidated senior
living properties to a venture in which Sunrise owns a 10percent interest. The aggregate purchase
price was $94million. Sunrise realized $14million in gain, subject to meeting certain operating
contingencies of which $5million and $9million was recognized in 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Sunrise will continue to operate all five properties under long-term management contracts. In September, 2003, Sunrise completed the sale/long-term manage back of its 100% interest in 16
consolidated senior living properties to a retirement properties company for an aggregate sales
price of $158million. Sunrise realized $14million in gain, subject to meeting certain operating
contingencies, of which $9million and $5million was recognized in 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Sunrise continues to operate all 16 properties under long-term management contracts. In 2004, Sunrise recognized $24million in income from property sales related to sales that
occurred in 2003, which was deferred until certain contingencies were met. Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust In December2004, Sunrise closed the initial public offering of Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate
Investment Trust Sunrise REIT, an independent entity established by Sunrise in Canada.
Concurrently with the closing of its initial public offering, Sunrise
REIT issued Cdn. $25million
US $21million at December31, 2004 principal amount of subordinated convertible debentures to
Sunrise, convertible at the rate of Cdn. $1100 per unit. The proceeds from the offering and
placement of the debentures were used by Sunrise REIT to acquire interests in 23 senior living
communities from Sunrise and Sunrise joint ventures, eight of which are in Canada and 15 of which
are in the United States. Three of these communities were acquired directly from Sunrise for an
aggregate purchase price of $40million and 20 were acquired from joint ventures in which Sunrise
participated for an aggregate purchase price of $373million. With respect to these three communities, Sunrise realized a gain of $4
million, of which $2million was deferred until certain operating
contingencies are satisfied. In addition, income from property sales was reduced by $2million for
incentive compensation to certain employees directly related to the establishment of Sunrise
REIT. Sunrise contributed its interest in
the 15 U.S. communities to an affiliate of Sunrise REIT in exchange for a 15% ownership
interest in that entity. Sunrise REIT also acquired an 80percent interest in a recently completed Sunrise community
that is in lease-up in Canada for a purchase price of $12million, with Sunrise retaining a 20
percent interest. In addition, Sunrise has identified nine development projects that will be
presented to Sunrise REIT for their potential acquisition. 95 14. Commitments Leases Sunrise leases its corporate offices, regional offices, development offices and warehouse space
under various leases. During 1998, Sunrise entered into an agreement to lease new office space for
its corporate headquarters. The lease commenced upon completion of the building in July1999 and
expires in September2013. The lease has an initial annual base rent of $1million. In September
2003, Sunrise entered an agreement to lease additional office space for its corporate headquarters.
The new lease commenced in September2003 and expires in September2013. The lease has an initial
annual base rent of $3million. The base rent for both of these leases escalates approximately 25%
per year in accordance with a base rent schedules. The warehouse lease has a term of ten years,
including a 5-year extension that expires in September2005. The initial annual base rent payments
amount to $106,000 for the extension term, subject to annual increases of 3%. Sunrise has also entered into operating leases for four properties. Two properties commenced
operations during 1997 and two properties commenced operations in 1998. In May1999, in connection
with the acquisition of Karrington, Sunrise assumed six operating leases for six senior living
properties and a ground lease. The operating lease terms vary from 15-20years, with two ten-year
extension options. Sunrise also has three other ground leases related to three properties in
operation. Lease terms range from 15 to 99years and are subject to annual increases based on the
consumer price index and/or stated increases in the lease. Sunrise is also required to amortize an
additional $118,000 of rent related to the straight lining of rent benefits for its operational
leases. In March2003, in connection with the acquisition of MSLS, Sunrise assumed sixteen operating leases
and renewed an existing operating lease agreement for another MSLS property in June2003. Fifteen
of the leases expire in 2013, while the remaining two leases expire in 2018. Future minimum lease payments under office, equipment, ground and other operating leases at

96 Sunrise anticipates future development to occur in joint ventures and expects to be reimbursed for
the majority of these costs by its capital partners when the ventures are formed. Guarantees As a part of Sunrises operating strategy, Sunrise may provide limited debt guarantees to certain
of its business ventures. Unless otherwise stated, Sunrise would be required to perform under a
debt guarantee if the business venture failed to perform under the debt agreement and the bank
pursued Sunrises guarantee. At December31, 2004, Sunrise provided $39million of debt guarantees
to its business ventures, which represents Sunrises maximum exposure under its debt guarantees. Debt guarantees to development joint ventures amount to $23million at
December31, 2004. Of the $23million in debt guarantees to development joint ventures, $10
million will be removed upon achieving certain debt service coverage targets and the remaining $13
million will remain in place throughout the terms of the loans. Debt guarantees to hospital
partnerships and acquisition partnerships amount to $10million and $4million, respectively, and
remain in place throughout the terms of the loans. Debt guarantees for Sunrises sale/long-term
manage back partnerships amount to $2million and are removed upon reaching certain occupancy and
debt service coverage targets. To date, Sunrise has not been required to fund any debt guarantees. Sunrise has provided $78million in financing obligations associated with management contracts. In
connection with the acquisition of MSLS in March2003, CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. CNL
agreed to assume the obligation to repay life care endowment obligations issued by MSLS with
respect to two continuing care retirement communities $76million at December31, 2004. To the
extent that CNL fails to satisfy this obligation, Sunrise would be required to repay this
obligation, the majority of which is expected to be refinanced with proceeds from the issuance of
new endowment obligations as new residents enter the communities. An additional $2million
financing obligation related to the acquisition of MSLS is made up of $1million of obligations to
provide financing under existing credit facilities with respect to four communities and $1million
of payment guarantees under operating agreements with respect to one community. At December31, 2004, Sunrise does not believe that it will be required to fund any guarantees
under its current outstanding debt guarantees and financing obligations and therefore no
liabilities are reflected in the consolidated financial statements for these guarantees. As part of Sunrises fee-development for joint ventures, Sunrise typically guarantees that
properties will be completed at budgeted costs approved by all partners in the joint venture.
Budgeted costs typically include significant contingency reserves for unforeseen costs and
potential overruns. Sunrise would be required to fund these guarantees if the actual costs of
development exceeded the approved budgeted costs. At December31, 2004, 28 properties are under
construction and subject to completion guarantees. Sunrise has over 20years experience in the
development and construction of senior living properties. Sunrises construction contractors are
experienced in building its prototype and assume much of the risk of on-time and on-budget
completion by executing fixed-price contracts. Typically, the terms of these guarantees provide
for no limitation to the maximum potential future payments under the guarantee. In certain
agreements, if Sunrise is required to fund the guarantee, the amounts funded become loans to the
venture and earn interest. Sunrise closely monitors these projects and does not expect to fund
any amounts under these development completion guarantees during 2005. None were funded during
2004 and 2003. 97 On January1, 2003, Sunrise adopted FASB Interpretation No45, Guarantors Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others
FIN 45. FIN 45 requires companies to initially record at fair value guarantees meeting the
characteristics described in this Interpretation, which is different from the general practice of
recording a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, as defined by FASB
Statement No5, Accounting for Contingencies. The Interpretation also requires a guarantor to
provide new disclosures for guarantees even if the likelihood of the guarantors having to make
payments under the guarantee is remote. The Interpretations initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are
applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December31, 2002,
irrespective of the guarantors fiscal year-end. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material
impact on the consolidated financial position or results of operation. Operating Deficit Credit Facilities As a part of certain management contracts, Sunrise may provide an operating deficit credit
facility. This means that if a property has depleted all of its operating reserves and does not
generate enough cash flow during a month to cover its expenses, Sunrise would provide a loan to the
community to cover the cash shortfall. These loans are generally included with Sunrises
development joint ventures and usually are provided for a limited period of time. At December31,
2004, 16 operating communities were subject to an operating deficit credit facility and 25
additional properties will be subject to a credit facility upon opening. Sunrise funded $06
million under these credit facilities through 2003 related to six communities and $18million in
2004 related to three communities. At December31, 2004, $07million has been repaid. Sunrise
expects to fund an additional $08million during 2005 related to two Canadian communities. Credit Support Arrangements In certain transactions, Sunrise has provided credit support arrangements and commitments to
advance funds to portfolios of properties that Sunrise has developed
or for which we acquired management contracts with an opportunity for
significant occupancy increases.
Generally, credit support arrangements are for limited periods of time and require payments if cash
flow is below stated targets. For portfolios that we sell, we
establish reserves from property sale transaction proceeds
to fund these potential payments. Payments in excess of reserve amounts are expensed unless they
are in the form of contractual advances. At December31, 2004, Sunrise had three joint venture
agreements comprising 25 properties that were subject to credit support arrangements. Generally,
these arrangements terminate within two and 22months. Sunrise
expects to fund $2million in 2005 under these arrangements. At December31, 2004,
Sunrise has commitments to advance funds on 46 communities, the
longest
of which is for less than two years. Advances under these commitments are recoverable as loans and are generally
repayable to Sunrise from property operating cash flows and/or proceeds from the sale of the
property. Sunrise expects to fund $13million in 2005 under
these arrangements. 98 Legal Proceedings Sunrise is a defendant in a lawsuit filed by CGB Occupational Therapy, Inc. CGB. CGB provided
therapy services to two nursing home facilities in Pennsylvania that were owned by RHA Pennsylvania
Nursing Homes RHA and managed by one of Sunrises subsidiaries. In 1998, RHA terminated CGBs
contract. In its lawsuit, CGB alleged among other things that in connection with that
termination, Sunrise interfered with their contractual relationships with iRHA and iiseveral
of the therapists that CGB employed on an at-will basis. In June2002, a jury awarded CGB $685,000
in compensatory damages and $13million in punitive damages. Sunrise appealed this verdict. In January2004, CGB was awarded $109,000 in compensatory damages for interference with the
relationship between CGB and its therapists which Sunrise subsequently paid. Because it was
impossible to tell what portion of the $13million punitive damages award was attributable to the
invalid claim, the court of appeals remanded a new trial limited to the issues of liability for and
amount of punitive damages. On January19, 2005, following the retrial concerning punitive
damages, a new jury awarded CGB $30million in punitive damages. On January28, 2005, Sunrise filed a motion seeking a new trial on the grounds that, among other
things, the jurys finding that punitive damages are warranted is against the weight of the
evidence, and that the verdict is the product of the jurys passion and prejudice. In the
alternative, Sunrise is seeking to have the court reduce the jurys award to a constitutionally
permissible amount. Sunrise believes that the courts should vacate the judgment or reduce the
judgment to a constitutionally permissible range. However, Sunrise cannot provide any assurance as
to the outcome of this matter. Sunrise does not believe that a material reserve is required at
December31, 2004. Sunrise is involved in various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business. In
the opinion of management, although the outcomes of these suits and claims are uncertain, in the
aggregate they should not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and
results of operations. 15. Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying
amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amount used for income
tax purposes. The primary components of Sunrises net deferred tax asset are as follows in thousands

to offset future taxable income of approximately $31million and state net operating loss
carryforwards of $52million, which expire from 2010 through 2022. Additionally, Sunrise had $38
million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards that have an unlimited carryforward period to
offset future foreign taxable income. At December31, 2004, Sunrise had alternative minimum tax credits of approximately $8million and
Work-Opportunity tax credits of approximately $3million available to offset future federal tax
liabilities. The alternative minimum tax credits have no expiration period and the work
opportunity tax credits will expire from 2019 through 2024. Realization of the net deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income
prior to expiration of the loss and credit carryforwards. Sunrise expects to fully utilize the
loss and credit carryforwards prior to expiration. Significant components of the provision for income taxes are as follows in thousands

In 2004, 2003 and 2002, Sunrise paid federal, state and international income taxes, net of refunds
of $63million, $1million and $2million, respectively. Current taxes payable for 2004, 2003 and
2002 have been reduced by approximately $8million, $9million, and $3million respectively,
reflecting the tax benefit to Sunrise of employee stock options exercised during the year. The tax
benefit has been recognized as an increase to additional paid-in capital. The differences between the tax provision calculated at the statutory federal income tax rate and

schools with day care centers, a leadership center, and a stand-alone day care center opened April
2004. Paul and Teresa Klaassen, Sunrises founders, are on the
Board of Directors and serve as officers of SSLF. SSLF paid Sunrise a management fee of
$84,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002 for the provision of office facilities
and support services in those years. Such amounts are included in operating revenue. Sunrise also
accepted a promissory note from SSLF during 2001 see Note 5. The principal amount of the
promissory note and accrued interest were repaid during 2003. Prior
to August 2003, Sunrise also subleased a portion of a ground lease
to SSLF. See Ground Lease below. As mentioned above, SSLF operates a leadership center. At various times since 2002, Sunrise has
rented the leadership center for management and staff retreats or other corporate events. During
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, rents paid to SSLF for use of the leadership center totaled
approximately $259,000, $106,000 and $41,000. In April2003, Sunrise also began to manage the
center for SSLF and to lease employees to SSLF who work at the leadership center. Salary and benefits for
these individuals totaled approximately $232,000 for 2004 and $193,000 for 2003. In addition, a subsidiary of SSLF formed a limited liability company LLCin 2001 to develop and
construct an assisted living facility and an adult day care center for low to moderate-income
seniors in Virginia. In 2004, the LLC agreed to construct the project for a fixed fee of $112million to be
paid by Fairfax County, Virginia upon completion of the project. In the fourth quarter of
2004, the LLC, Sunrise and Fairfax County entered into an agreement
pursuant to which Sunrise will develop and
manage the project for a fee of $180,000. During 2004, Sunrise funded development costs of
approximately $870,000. Subsequent to year-end, SSLF transferred and assigned its membership interest in
the LLC to Sunrise, with Sunrise assuming development and construction of this project. In April2004, Sunrise began subleasing space to a subsidiary of SSLF to use as a day care center.
The sublease runs though September30, 2013. The sublease payments are approximately $7,000 per
month currently, which equal payments made by Sunrise to the landlord for this space. These
payments totaled $56,000 for 2004. At December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, Sunrise has receivables from SSLF and its affiliates
of $34million and $26million for operating and development expenses. This amount is included in
Accounts Receivable in the consolidated balance sheets. Ground Lease Sunrise
leases the real property on which its Fairfax, Virginia community is
located from Paul and Teresa Klaassen pursuant to a 99-year ground
lease entered into in June 1986. This ground lease was amended in
August 2003. Prior to August 2003, Sunrise subleased approximately
50% of the property subject to the ground lease to SSLF for the
operation by SSLF of a school and day care center on the property,
for monthly rent equal to 50% of all of the rent payable under the
ground lease. In August 2003, the sublease was terminated and the
ground lease was amended to provide for the lease by Sunrise of only
the real property not previously subleased to SSLF and the Klaassens
entered into a separate ground lease with SSLF with respect to such
previously subleased property. Rent expense under this lease was
$317,000, $299,000 and $296,000 for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Sublease rental income was
$158,700, $155,000 and $149,500 for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 101 Joint Ventures Sunrise entered into unconsolidated joint venture arrangements with a third party that is providing
equity capital to develop up to 20 projects in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. A
director of Sunrise, Craig Callen, is a former managing director of Credit Suisse First Boston
CSFBLLC. The parent of CSFB LLC controls through funds sponsored by an affiliate or subsidiary
investments, which from time to time have included investments in the joint ventures. Sunrise
provided management and pre-opening services to the joint ventures on a contract-fee basis and has
agreed to invest up to $7million of equity capital in the joint ventures. Sunrise recognized
management and contract services fees from these joint ventures of $5million, $6million and $8
million, respectively, in 2004, 2003 and 2002. At December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the third
party has provided approximately $52million, $51million and $52million, respectively, and
Sunrise has provided $7million, $7million, and $6million, respectively, of equity capital to the
joint ventures. Sunrise and the third party have sold their interests in certain of the joint ventures over the
past 3years. At December31, 2004, the third partys remaining interest in the joint ventures was
approximately $9million and Sunrises remaining interest was approximately $4million. 17. Profit-Sharing Plan Sunrise has a profit-sharing plan the Plan under Internal Revenue Code Section401k. All
employees of Sunrise are covered by the Plan and are eligible to participate in the Plan after
meeting certain eligibility requirements. Deferred salary contributions are made through pre-tax
salary deferrals of between 1% and 100%. Employees with less than 5years of service will receive an employer contribution of $025 for
every dollar that the employee contributes, up to 7% of the employees annual compensation. When an
employee reaches 5years of service, Sunrise will contribute $050 for every dollar that the
employee contributes, up to 7% of the employees annual compensation. Employees vest in their
matching employer contributions 100% over four years at 25% each year. The Plan has no
discretionary matching contributions and all employees who earn $90,000 or less annually are
eligible to receive regular matching contributions provided the employee meets certain eligibility
requirements. Matching contributions expensed were $08million, $08million, and $02million
during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 18. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following disclosures of estimated fair value were determined by management, using available
market information and valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret
market data and develop estimated fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not
necessarily indicative of the amounts Sunrise could realize on disposition of the financial
instruments. The use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have an effect
on the estimated fair value amounts. 102 Cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses,
marketable securities, investments and other current assets and liabilities are carried at amounts
which reasonably approximate their fair values. Fixed rate debt with an aggregate carrying value of $1484million has an estimated aggregate fair
value of $1912million at December31, 2004. Estimated fair value of fixed rate debt is based on
interest rates currently available to Sunrise for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining
maturities. The estimated fair value of variable rate debt is estimated to be approximately equal
to its carrying value of $433million at December31, 2004. Disclosure about fair value of financial instruments is based on pertinent information available to
management at December31, 2004. Although management is not aware of any factors that would
significantly affect the reasonable fair value amounts, these amounts have not been comprehensively
revalued for purposes of these financial statements since December31, 2004 and current estimates
of fair value may differ from the amounts presented herein. 19. Information about Sunrises Segments Sunrise operates within one defined business segment with activities related to management,
development, acquisition and disposition of senior living services both domestically and
internationally. International revenues from operations were $17million and $5million for 2004
and 2003, respectively. International expenses from operations were $11million and $7million in
2004 and 2003, respectively. 20. Subsequent Events In January2005, Sunrise announced that it had entered into asset purchase agreements with The
Fountains, a Tucson, Arizona based owner and operator of senior living communities to acquire
management of 19 senior living communities, ownership of 18 of the communities, several undeveloped
land parcels and certain other assets. Sunrises prospective capital partner for this transaction
is an affiliate of Arcapita Inc. formerly, Crescent Capital Investments, Inc. The Arcapita
affiliate is expected to acquire an 80percent interest in the real estate associated with 17
senior living communities, to be held in a joint venture to be formed by Sunrise and the Arcapita
affiliate. Sunrise will acquire the 18th community and assume management of The
Fountains 19 senior living communities which have capacity for approximately 5,000 residents
under long-term management contracts. This transaction is expected to close in mid-2005. Sunrises
portion of the asset purchase is estimated to be $63million. In January2005, Sunrise secured an increase of its equity development funding for a United Kingdom
UKjoint venture with an affiliate of Prudential Real Estate Investors that will provide for, in
conjunction with loans provided by third-party lenders, total development funding for this venture
of approximately $8642million 4625million pounds Sterling, or 118percent increase over the
ventures initial capital structure which was announced in May2002. Additionally, Sunrise has
agreed to increase its funding commitment for this UK venture by $187million to approximately
$346million and maintain its 20% equity interest in this venture. Under this joint venture,
Sunrise currently has 14 sites under development in the UK, six of which are under construction
with final planning approval received on an additional two. Sunrise will manage all of these
properties under long-term management contracts. 103 21. Quarterly Results of Operations Unaudited The following is a summary of quarterly results of operations for the fiscal quarters: in
