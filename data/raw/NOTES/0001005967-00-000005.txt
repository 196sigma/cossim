will vest semi-annually for the next 24 months. The term of each option granted is generally the earlier of i ten years or ii 30
days after termination of the employment of the holder. 
2Based on an aggregate of 1,442,240 options granted to employees, consultants and directors, including the
Named Executive Officers, of the Company during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000. 
3The exercise price per share of each option was equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on the
date of grant. 
4The potential realizable value is calculated based on the term of the option at its time of grant. It is
calculated by assuming that the stock price on the date of grant appreciates at the indicated annual rate, compounded annually for
the entire term of the option and that the option is exercised and sold on the last day of its term for the appreciated stock price.
All calculations are based on rounding the number of years remaining on the term of the option to the nearest whole number. No gain
to the option holder is possible unless the stock price increases over the option term. The 5% and 10% assumed rates of appreciation
are derived from the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and do not represent the Company estimate or projection of the
future Common Stock price. AGGREGATED OPTION EXERCISES IN LAST FISCAL YEAR AND FISCAL YEAR-END OPTION VALUES
This table discloses the aggregate dollar value realized upon exercise of stock options in the last fiscal
