32 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Manhattan Associates, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Manhattan
Associates, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2002 and
2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity,
comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the two years in the period
ended December31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the Index at a as of December31, 2002 and 2003,
and for each of the two years then ended. These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits. The financial statements and schedule of the
Company as of December31, 2001, and for the year then ended were audited by
other auditors who have ceased operations and whose reports dated January31,
2002 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and
schedule before the restatement adjustments described in Notes 1 and
3. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of the Company at December31, 2002 and 2003, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended
December31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
January1, 2002, the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and
other intangible assets to conform with Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards No141, Business Combination, and No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets. Also, as described in Note 1, in 2002 the Company changed
its method of presenting reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses in the
Consolidated Statements of Income upon adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue 01-14, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for
Out-of-Pocket Expenses Incurred. As discussed above, the consolidated financial statements and schedule of
the Company as of December31, 2001, and for the year then ended were audited
by other auditors who have ceased operations. As discussed in Note 1, Interest income and Interest
expense included in Other income expense, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended
December31, 2001 were reclassified to Interest income and
Interest expense in the
Consolidated Statements of Income. Our audit procedures with respect to the
adjustments included agreeing all of the income statement amounts
reclassified to the Companys underlying records obtained from management. Also, the consolidated financial
statements of the Company for the year ended December31, 2001
have been restated to include the income
tax effect for Accumulated other comprehensive income lossin the
Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity.
Our audit procedures with respect to the adjustments included aagreeing the Accumulated other comprehensive
income loss, net of related income taxes, the Deferred income taxes balances,
and the components of Accumulated other comprehensive income lossto the
Companys underlying records obtained from management and btesting the
mathematical accuracy of the application of those 33 Table of Contents restatement adjustments to the previously reported amounts of Accumulated
other comprehensive income lossand Deferred income taxes. Also, as discussed in Note 1, the
consolidated financial statements
of the Company for the year ended December31, 2001 have been
revised to include the transitional disclosures required by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other Intangibles, which
was adopted by the Company as of January1, 2002. Our audit procedures with
respect to the disclosures in Note 1 with respect to 2001 included a
agreeing the previously reported net income to the previously issued financial
statements, bagreeing the adjustments to reported net income representing
amortization expense including any related tax effects recognized in those
periods related to goodwill that is no longer being amortized as a result of
initially applying Statement No142 including any related tax effects to the
Companys underlying records obtained from management, cagreeing all 2001 amortization expense disclosures to the
Companys underlying accounting records obtained from management
and dtesting the mathematical accuracy of the reconciliation of adjusted net income
to reported net income. Also, as discussed in Notes 1 and 3, the consolidated financial statements
of the Company as of December31, 2001 and for the year then ended have been
revised to include the disclosures required by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure, which was adopted by the Company as of
December31, 2002. Our audit procedures with respect to the disclosures in
Note 1 for 2001 included aagreeing the previously reported net income to the
previously issued financial statements, bagreeing the adjustments to
reported net income representing compensation expense and pro forma
compensation expense including any related tax effects related to those
periods to the Companys underlying records obtained from management and c
testing the mathematical accuracy of the reconciliation of pro forma net income
to reported net income and related earnings per share amounts. Also, as discussed in Note 1, the consolidated financial statements of the
Company for the year ended December31, 2001 have been revised to reclassify
reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses previously recorded as a
reduction of operating expenses to hardware and other revenue and an increase
in cost of hardware and other revenue required by Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue 01-14, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for
Out-of-Pocket Expenses Incurred, which was adopted by the Company in 2002. Our
audit procedures with respect to these reclassifications for 2001 included a
agreeing the amounts of reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses related to those
periods to the Companys underlying records obtained from management, and b
testing the mathematical accuracy of the application of these reclassification
adjustments to the previously reported amounts of hardware and other revenue
and cost of hardware and other. In our opinion, the disclosures and restatements for 2001 with respect to
the matters referred to in the preceding five paragraphs are appropriate.
However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the
2001 consolidated financial statements of the Company other than with respect
to such disclosures and restatements and, accordingly, we do not express an
opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole.   
ERNST YOUNG LLP   
Atlanta, Georgia
March15, 2004
34 Table of Contents Note: This is a copy of a report previously issued by Arthur Andersen LLP, the
Companys former independent accountants. The Arthur Andersen LLP report
refers to certain financial information for the years ended December31, 1999
and 2000 and certain balance sheet information at December31, 2000 and 2001,
which are no longer included in the accompanying financial statements. Arthur
Andersen LLP has not reissued this report in connection with the filing of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K. Section11a of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended the Securities
Act, provides that if any part of a registration statement at the time such
part becomes effective contains an untrue statement of a material fact or an
omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, any person acquiring a security
pursuant to such registration statement unless it is proved that at the time
of such acquisition such person knew of such untruth or omission may assert a
claim against, among others, every accountant who has consented to be named as
having prepared or certified any part of the registration statement, or as
having prepared or certified any report or valuation which is used in
connection with the registration statement, with respect to such statements in
such registration statement, report or valuation if they purport to have been
prepared or certified by the accountant. On April24, 2002, Manhattan Associates, Inc. Manhattan determined not
to renew the engagement of Arthur Andersen LLP Andersen as its independent
auditor and retained Ernst Young LLP as Manhattans independent auditors with
respect to the audit of Manhattans consolidated financial statements for its
fiscal year ending December31, 2002. This Form 10-K is incorporated by
reference into Manhattans previously filed registration statements on Form S-8
File Nos. 333-68968, 333-45802, 333-105913 and 333-60635 the Registration Statements and, for purposes of determining
liability under the Securities Act, is deemed a new registration statement for
each Registration Statement into which it is incorporated by reference. After
reasonable efforts, Manhattan has been unable to obtain Andersens written
consent to the incorporation by reference into the Registration Statements of
Andersens audit report with respect to Manhattans consolidated financial
statements for the fiscal year ended December31, 2001. Under these
circumstances, Rule437a under the Securities Act permits Manhattan to file
this Form 10-K without a written consent from Andersen. As a result, Andersen
will not have any liability under Section 11a of the Securities Act for any
untrue statements of material fact contained in the financial statements
audited by Andersen or any omissions of a material fact required to be stated
therein. Accordingly, you would be unable to assert a claim against Andersen
under Section 11a of the Securities Act for any purchases of securities under
the Registration Statements made on or after the date of this Form 10-K. In
addition, the ability of Andersen to satisfy any claims including claims
arising from Andersens provision of auditing and other services to Manhattan
may be limited as a practical matter due to recent events regarding Andersen.
To the extent provided in Section11b3c of the Securities Act, however,
other persons who are liable under Section 11a of the Securities Act,
including Manhattans officers and directors, may still rely on Andersens
original audit reports as being made by an expert for purposes of establishing
a due diligence defense under Section 11b of the Securities Act. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To Manhattan Associates, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MANHATTAN
ASSOCIATES, INC. a Georgia corporation AND SUBSIDIARIES as of December31,
2000 and 2001 and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders
equity, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December31, 2001. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Manhattan Associates, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December31, 2000 and 2001 and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

original maturities of three months or less to be cash or cash equivalents. Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents,
short- and long-term investments and accounts receivable. The Company
maintains cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments with
various financial institutions. The Companys sales are primarily to companies
located in the United States and Europe. The Company performs periodic credit
evaluations of its customers financial condition and does not require
collateral. Accounts receivable are due principally from large U.S. and
European companies under stated contract terms. The Company provides for
estimated uncollectible amounts and credit losses at the time of sale. 41 Table of Contents 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued The Companys top five customers in aggregate accounted for 21%, 16% and
16% of total revenue for each of the years ended December31, 2001, 2002, and
2003, respectively. Sales to one customer the significant customer
accounted for approximately 10% of total revenue for the year ended December
31, 2001. Most of the revenue from the significant customer in 2001 arose from
purchases of hardware. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of
revenue in 2002 or 2003. Accounts receivable from the significant customer on
December31, 2001 was approximately $43million. On January22, 2002, the
significant customer for 2001 filed for bankruptcy under Chapter11 of the
United States Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the filing, the uncertainties
around the bankruptcy proceedings and the ultimate timing of payment, we
recorded an allowance of $43million in 2001 to effectively defer revenues
arising in the fourth quarter of 2001 from the significant customer, but unpaid
at the time of the bankruptcy declaration. The allowance included
approximately $23million of software fees, $16million of fees for
professional services and $04million of hardware. In September2002, the
United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois Eastern
Division authorized the significant customers request to assume the software
license, services, support and enhancement agreement. With the appeals process
completed in October2002, the Company recovered approximately $23million of
the receivable during the fourth quarter of 2002. Upon receiving the final
cash settlement in June2003, subsequent to the significant customer emerging
from bankruptcy, the Company recovered an additional $848,000 of the receivable
during the second quarter of 2003. The recoveries were recorded as separate
revenue line items in the consolidated statements of income and
reductions to
the allowance for doubtful accounts in the consolidated balance sheets during
the respective quarters. Investments The Companys investments in marketable securities consist of debt
instruments of the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies and corporate
commercial paper. These investments are categorized as available-for-sale
securities and recorded at fair market value, as defined by SFAS No115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Investments
with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash
equivalents, investments with original maturities of greater than 90days but
less than one year are classified as short-term investments, and those with
original maturities of greater than one year are classified as long-term
investments. The long-term investments consist of debt instruments of U.S.
government agencies and mature after one year through five years. Unrealized
holding gains and losses are reflected as a net amount in a separate component
of shareholders equity until realized. For the purposes of computing realized
gains and losses, cost is identified on a specific identification basis. At
December31, 2002 and 2003, the cumulative unrealized gain on short- and
long-term investments was $29,000 and $14,000, respectively. At
December 31, 2002 and 2003, the cumulative unrealized loss on short-
and long-term investments was $0 and $9,000, respectively. The following is a

On July11, 2003,
the Company made a cash investment of $2million in Alien
Technology Corp. Alien, a provider of ultra-low cost radio frequency identification
RFIDtags and hardware. The investment represents approximately a 15%
ownership interest in the privately-held corporation.
The Companys maximum exposure to loss as a result of its
investment with Alien is its investment of $2million. The investment has been
accounted for under the cost method, and is included in Other Assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. 42 Table of Contents 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful
accounts, which is based upon an evaluation of historical amounts written-off,
the Companys customers ability to pay and general economic conditions; the
useful lives of intangible assets; the recoverability or impairment of
intangible asset values; and the Companys effective income tax rate and
deferred tax assets, which are based upon the Companys expectations of future
taxable income, allowable deductions, and projected tax credits. Actual
results could differ from these estimates. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and
other financial instruments included in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets approximate their fair values principally due to the short-term
maturities of these instruments. Unrealized gains and losses on investments
are included as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive
income, net of any related tax effect, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Risks Associated with Single Business Line, Technological Advances, and
Foreign Operations The Company currently derives a substantial portion of its revenues from
sales of its software and related services and hardware. The markets for
supply chain execution are subject to rapid technological change, changing
customer needs, frequent new product introductions, and evolving industry
standards that may render existing products and services obsolete. As a
result, the Companys position in these markets could be eroded rapidly by
unforeseen changes in customer requirements for application features,
functions, and technologies. The Companys growth and future operating results
will depend, in part, upon its ability to enhance existing applications and
develop and introduce new applications that meet changing customer
requirements, that respond to competitive products and that achieve market
acceptance. Any factor adversely affecting the markets for supply chain
execution solutions could have an adverse effect on the Companys business,
financial condition, and results of operations. The Companys international business is subject to risks typical of an
international business, including, but not limited to: differing economic
conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other
regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility.
Accordingly, the future results could be materially adversely impacted by
changes in these or other factors. The Company recognized foreign exchange
rate gains of approximately $830,000 in 2002 and $1,283,000 in 2003, classified
in Other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Revenue Recognition The Companys revenue consists of revenues from the licensing and hosting
of software; fees from consulting, implementation and training services
collectively, professional services, plus customer support services and
software enhancement subscriptions; and sales of hardware. The Company recognizes software license revenue under Statement of
Position No97-2, Software Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2, as amended by
Statement of Position No98-9, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to
Certain Transactions SOP 98-9, specifically when the following criteria
are met: 1a signed contract is obtained; 2delivery of the product has
occurred; 3the license fee is fixed or determinable; and 4collectibility
is probable. SOP 98-9 requires recognition of revenue using the residual
method when 1there is vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair values
of all undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement that is not
accounted for using long-term contract accounting; 2vendor-specific
objective evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more of the
delivered elements in the arrangement; and 3all revenue-recognition criteria
in SOP 97-2, other than the requirement for vendor-specific objective evidence
of the fair value of each delivered element of the arrangement are satisfied.
For those contracts that contain significant customization or modifications,
license revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method. 43 Table of Contents 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued The Companys services revenue consists of fees generated from
professional services, customer support services and software enhancement
subscriptions related to the Companys software products. Fees from
professional services performed by the Company are generally billed on an
hourly basis, and revenue is recognized as the services are performed.
Professional services are sometimes rendered under agreements in which billings
are limited to contractual maximums or based upon a fixed-fee for portions of
or all of the engagement, but only in instances when the scope of the project
is reasonably quantifiable. Revenue related to fixed-fee based contracts is
recognized on a percent complete basis based on the hours incurred. Project
losses are provided for in their entirety in the period in which they become
known. Revenue related to customer support services and software enhancement
subscriptions are generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the
term of the agreement, typically 12months. Hardware revenue is generated from the resale of a variety of hardware
products, developed and manufactured by third parties, that are integrated with
and complementary to the Companys software solutions. As part of a complete
solution, the Companys customers frequently purchase hardware from the Company
in conjunction with the licensing of software. These products include computer
hardware, radio frequency terminals networks, RFID chip readers, bar code
printers and scanners, and other peripherals. Hardware revenue is recognized
upon shipment to the customer when title passes. The Company generally
purchases hardware from its vendors only after receiving an order from a
customer. As a result, the Company does not maintain significant hardware
inventory. In accordance with the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No01-14
EITF No01-14, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements
Received for Out-of-Pocket Expenses Incurred, the company recognizes amounts
associated with reimbursements from customers for out-of-pocket expenses as
revenue. Such amounts have been classified to hardware and other revenue. The
total amount of expense reimbursement recorded to revenue was $51million 54million and $65million for 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue represents amounts collected prior to complete
performance of professional services, customer support services and software
enhancement subscriptions and significant remaining obligations under license
agreements. The Company expects to complete such services or obligations
within the next twelve months. Returns and Allowances The Company has not experienced significant returns or warranty claims to
date and, as a result, has not recorded a provision for the cost of returns and
product warranty claims at December31, 2002 or 2003. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the
historical experience of write-offs and a detailed assessment of accounts
receivable. Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts generally
represent a sales allowance on services revenue, which are recorded to
operations as a reduction to services revenue. The total amounts charged to
operations was $27million, $31million and $35million for 2001, 2002 and
2003, respectively. The amounts for each year do not include amounts relating
to the significant customer described above. In estimating the allowance for
doubtful accounts, management considers the age of the accounts receivable, the
Companys historical write-offs, and the credit worthiness of the customer,
among others. Should any of these factors change, the estimates made by
management will also change accordingly, which could affect the level of the
Companys future provision for doubtful accounts. Uncollectible accounts are
written off when it is determined that the specific balance is not collectible. 44 Table of Contents 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Property and Equipment Property and equipment consists of furniture, computers, other office
equipment, purchased software for internal use, and leasehold improvements
recorded at cost. The Company depreciates the cost of furniture, computers,
other office equipment and purchased software on a straight-line basis over
their estimated useful lives three years for computer equipment and software,
five years for office equipment, seven years for furniture. Leasehold
improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the term
of the lease. Included in computer equipment and software are assets under a
capital lease of approximately $239,000 and $247,000, net of depreciation, as
of December31, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Depreciation and amortization
expense for property and equipment, including assets under a capital lease, for
the years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 was approximately $5,719,000 6,275,000 and $7,487,000, respectively, and was included in general and

Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets Acquisition-related intangible assets are stated at historical cost and
include acquired software and certain other intangible assets with definite
lives. The acquired software is being amortized over the greater of the amount
computed using athe ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to
the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or
bthe straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the
product including the period being reported on. The other intangible assets
are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of two to ten years.
Total amortization expense related to acquisition-related intangible assets
was approximately $1,867,000, $1,772,000 and $3,432,000 for the years ended
December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively, and is included in amortization

longer being amortized. On January1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under the new statement, the Company no
longer amortizes goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, but
instead tests for impairment on at least an annual basis. The following

Approximately
$355million of the gross Goodwill and Intangible Assets
with indefinite lives is deductible for income tax purposes. Software Development Costs Research and development expenses are charged to expense as incurred. The
Company determines the amount of development costs capitalizable under the
provisions of SFAS No86, Accounting for Costs of Computer Software to Be
Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. Computer software development costs are
charged to research and development expense until technological feasibility is
established, after which remaining software production costs are capitalized in
accordance with SFAS No86. The Company has defined technological feasibility
as the point in time at which the Company has a detailed program design or a
working model of the related product, depending on the type of development
efforts. For the years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, the Company
capitalized no internal research and development costs because the costs
incurred between the attainment of technological feasibility for the related
software product through the date when the product was available for general
release to customers has been insignificant. During 2001, payments of
approximately $717,000 were made to an outside research and development
organization to internationalize PkMS into Japanese, German, French and
Spanish. The payments were capitalized as Other Assets and were amortized over
a two-year period beginning in January2002. All capitalized research and
development costs were fully amortized as of December31, 2003. Total
amortization expense related to software development costs capitalized prior to
2000 and during 2001 was approximately $409,000, $526,000 and $343,000 for the
years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively, and is included in
cost of software fees in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 46 Table of Contents 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Impairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets The Company periodically reviews the values assigned to long-lived assets,
including property and certain intangible assets, to determine whether events
and circumstances have occurred which indicate that the remaining estimated
useful lives may warrant revision or that the remaining balances may not be
recoverable. In such reviews, undiscounted cash flows associated with these
assets are compared with their carrying value to determine if a write-down to
fair value is required. Management believes the long-lived and intangible
assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are fairly valued. The evaluation of asset impairment requires management to make assumptions
about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated. These
assumptions require significant judgment, and actual results may differ from
assumed and estimated amounts. Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives In accordance with SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
which was adopted in its entirety on January1, 2002, the Company evaluates the
carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets annually as of December
31 and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that
would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below
its carrying amount. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to,
1a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, 2
unanticipated competition, or 3an adverse action or assessment by a
regulator. When evaluating whether the goodwill or other intangible asset is
impaired, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to which
the goodwill or other intangible asset is assigned to its carrying amount,
including goodwill and the other intangible assets. If the carrying amount of
a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the amount of the impairment loss
must be measured. The impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the
implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount. In
calculating the implied fair value of goodwill or other intangible assets, the
fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and
liabilities of that unit based on their fair values. The excess of the fair
value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and
liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. The initial evaluation of
goodwill and other intangible assets completed as of June30, 2002 in
accordance with SFAS No142 resulted in no impairment losses. Additionally,
the Company performed its periodic review of its goodwill and other intangible
assets for impairment as of December31, 2002 and 2003, and did not identify
any asset impairment as a result of the review. The Company also recorded no
impairment losses during 2001 prior to adopting SFAS No142. Guarantees and Indemnifications The Company accounts for guarantees in accordance with Financial Interpretation
No45 FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. The
Companys sales agreements with customers generally contain infringement
indemnity provisions. Under these agreements, the Company agrees to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the customer in connection with patent, copyright or
trade secret infringement claims made by third parties with respect to the
customers authorized use of the Companys products and services. The
indemnity provisions generally provide for the Companys control of defense and
settlement and cover costs and damages finally awarded against the customer, as
well as the Companys modification of the product so it is no longer infringing
or, if it cannot be corrected, return of the product for a refund. The sales
agreements with customers sometimes also contain indemnity provisions for
death, personal injury or property damage caused by the Companys personnel or
contractors in the course of performing services to customers. Under these
agreements, the Company agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
customer in connection with death, personal injury and property damage claims
made by third parties with respect to actions of the Companys personnel or
contractors. The indemnity provisions generally provide for the Companys
control of defense and settlement and cover costs and damages finally awarded
against the customer. The indemnity obligations contained in sales agreements
generally have no specified expiration date and no specified monetary
limitation on the amount of award covered. The Company has not previously
incurred costs to settle claims or pay awards under these indemnification
obligations. The Company accounts for these indemnity 47 Table of Contents 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued obligations in accordance with SFAS No5, Accounting for Contingencies, and
records a liability for these obligations when a loss is probable and
reasonably estimable. The Company has not recorded any liabilities for these
agreements as of December31, 2003. The Company
warrants to its customers that its software products will perform in all
material respects in accordance with the standard published specifications in
effect at the time of delivery of the licensed products to the customer for 90
days. Additionally, the Company warrants to its customers that services will be performed
consistent with generally accepted industry standards or specific service
levels through completion of the agreed upon services. If necessary, the
Company will provide for the estimated cost of product and service warranties
based on specific warranty claims and claim history. However, the Company has
not incurred significant recurring expense under product or service warranties.
As a result, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these agreements
is nominal. Accordingly, the Company has no liabilities recorded for these
agreements as of December31, 2003. Segment Information The Company operates in a single segment as defined by SFAS No131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. See Note
9 for discussion of foreign operations. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled approximately
$540,000, $715,000 and $855,000 in 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively.
Advertising costs are included in sales and marketing on the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Basic and Diluted Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed using net income divided by the

stock were outstanding during the years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003,
respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per
share because the options exercise price was greater than the average market
price of the common shares during the respective years. See Note 3 for further
information on those securities. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plan for stock
issued to employees under Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and, accordingly, records deferred
compensation for options granted at an exercise price below the fair value of
the underlying stock. The deferred compensation is presented as a component of
equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and is amortized over
the periods to be benefited, generally the vesting period of the options.
Effective in fiscal year 1996, the Company adopted the pro forma disclosure
option for stock-based compensation issued to employees of SFAS No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. 48 Table of Contents 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Pro forma information regarding net income and net income per share is
required by SFAS No123, which also requires that the information be
determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock option grants

vesting period of the options. The weighted average fair values of options at the date of grant for the
years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 was $2237, $1661 and $1752,

Reclassifications Certain reclassifications were made to the prior years financial
statements to conform to the 2003 presentation. Interest income and
Interest expense included in Other income expense, net, in the
Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended
December31, 2001 were reclassified to Interest income and
Interest expense. Certain assets included in Goodwill and intangible
assets with indefinite lives, net, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets
for the year ended December31, 2002 were reclassified to
Acquisition-related intangible assets, net. 49 Table of Contents 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued New Accounting Pronouncements In November2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF of the FASB
issued EITF Issue 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, which
addresses certain aspects of the accounting for arrangements that involve the
delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use
assets. Under EITF 00-21, revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables
should be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet
certain criteria, including whether the fair value of the delivered items can
be determined and whether there is evidence of fair value of the undelivered
items. In addition, the consideration should be allocated among the separate
units of accounting based on their fair values, and the applicable revenue
recognition criteria should be considered separately for each of the separate
units of accounting. EITF 00-21 is effective for revenue arrangements the
Company entered into after June30, 2003. The Company adopted EITF 00-21 on
July1, 2003. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on
the Companys consolidated statements of income, financial position or
liquidity. In December2002, the FASB issued SFAS No148, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No148 amends SFAS
No123, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to
the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. In addition, SFAS No148 amends the disclosure requirements of
SFAS No123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim
financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The
transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of SFAS No148 are
effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2002 and have been adopted
in these notes to the financial statements. The interim disclosure provisions
are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim
periods beginning after December15, 2002. As the Company did not make a
voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation in 2002 or 2003, the adoption of SFAS No148 did not
have a material impact on the Companys financial position and results of
operations. In January2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No46 FIN 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest EntitiesAn Interpretation of Accounting
Research Bulletin No51. In December2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN
46 FIN 46R, to clarify some of the provisions of FIN 46 to exempt certain
entities from its requirements. FIN 46 requires the consolidation of entities
in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses,
receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both, as a
result of ownership, contractual interests or other financial interests in the
entity. FIN 46 is effective for all new variable interest entities created or
acquired after January31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or
acquired prior to February1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied
during the first interim or annual period beginning after
March15, 2004. The Company does not believe that it currently
has relationships that will require it to initially consolidate or
disclose information about variable interest entities, other than
possibly the investment in Alien see discussion above under
Investments, when FIN46 becomes effective.
In
August2003, the EITF issued EITF Issue 03-05,
Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to
Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing
More-Than-Incidental Software, which addresses the accounting
for arrangements that include both software and non-software
deliverables, such as computer hardware. In arrangements that include
software and computer hardware, if the software is essential to the
functionality of the hardware, the hardware is considered software
related and, therefore, accounted for under SOP 97-2. The Company
adopted this guidance prospectively in August 2003. The adoption of
this guidance did not have a material effect on the consolidated
statements of income, financial position or liquidity.

The income tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options were
allocated to additional paid-in capital. Such amounts were approximately
$9,049,000, $14,024,000 and $11,322,000 for 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. As a result of the tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options,
the Company has federal net operating loss carry-forwards NOLs of
approximately $20,900,000 available to offset future income. The federal NOLs expire in 2021. The NOLs may be
subject to certain limitations in the event of a change in ownership. In
addition, the Company has approximately $4,846,000 of research and development
tax credit carryforwards that expire in 2018 to 2023. The Company has
provided a valuation allowance for the carryforwards. As the Company
is able to utilize the carryforwards, the reductions to the valuation
allowance will be charged to Additional paid-in-capital. The Company currently has a tax holiday in India through March of 2009.
As a result of this holiday, the Company had income of approximately $771,000
in 2003 that was not subject to tax. The India entity did not have income in
2001 or 2002. 51 Table of Contents 2. Income Taxes continued The following is a summary of the items that cause recorded income taxes

3. Stock Option Plans The Manhattan Associates LLC Option Plan the LLC Option Plan became
effective on January1, 1997. The LLC Option Plan is administered by a
committee appointed by the Board of Directors. The options are granted at
terms determined by the committee; however, the options cannot have a term
exceeding ten years. Options granted under the LLC Option Plan have vesting
periods ranging from immediately to six years. Subsequent to February28,
1998, no additional options could be granted pursuant to the LLC Option Plan. Prior to the establishment of the LLC Option Plan, the Company issued
options to purchase 661,784 shares of common stock to certain employees. These
grants contain provisions similar to options issued under the LLC Option Plan. The Manhattan Associates, Inc. 1998 Stock Incentive Plan the Stock

number of shares of common stock at a specified option price and subject to
such terms and conditions as are specified in connection with the option grant.
The Stock Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the

the administrative rules, guidelines and practices relating to the Stock
Incentive Plan generally and to interpret the provisions thereof. Options

the LLC Option Plan, in the form of stock options and other stock incentives.
The number of shares available for issuance under the Plan is automatically
adjusted, without shareholder approval, on the first day of each fiscal year,
beginning with the 2000 fiscal year, by a number of shares such that the total
number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan equals the sum of ithe
aggregate number of shares previously issued under the Plan and the LLC Option
Plan; iithe aggregate number of shares subject to then outstanding stock
incentives granted under the Plan and the LLC Option Plan; and iii5% of the
number of shares of common stock outstanding on the last day of the preceding
fiscal year. However, no more than 1,000,000 of the shares available for grant
each year shall be available for issuance pursuant to incentive stock options,
and no more than 10,000,000 shares resulting from such automatic adjustments
may ever be issued during the term of the Plan. 52 Table of Contents 3. Stock Option Plans continued A summary of changes in outstanding options is as follows

Employment Agreements The Company has entered into employment contracts with certain executives
and other key employees. The agreements provide for total severance payments
of up to approximately $28million for termination of employment for any
reason other than cause. Payment terms vary from a lump sum payment to equal
monthly installments over a period of not more than 24months. No amounts have
been accrued because the amounts cannot be reasonably estimated. Legal Matters Many of the Companys installations involve products that are critical to
the operations of its clients businesses. Any failure in a Company product
could result in a claim for substantial damages against the Company, regardless
of the Companys responsibility for such failure. Although the Company
attempts to limit contractually its liability for damages arising from product
failures or negligent acts or omissions, there can be no assurance the
limitations of liability set forth in its contracts will be enforceable in all
instances. The Company expenses legal costs associated with loss contingencies
as such legal costs are incurred. 6. Long-Term Debt A portion of the purchase price of the Intrepa acquisition was funded with
the issuance of a promissory note the Note. The Note was payable in four
equal installments of $175million, to be paid every six months beginning on
October1, 2001 and concluding on April1, 2003. The Note was subject to
interest at a rate of 8% per year, which was due on the last day of each fiscal
quarter of the Company for so long as principal remained outstanding under the
Note. Long-term debt as of December31, 2001 consisted of the $175million
payment due in April2003. In April2002, the Company prepaid in full $525
million outstanding under the Note; therefore, the Company has no long-term
debt as of December31, 2003. 54 Table of Contents 7. Acquisitions Logistics.com On December31, 2002, the Company acquired certain assets of

8. In-Process Research and Development, Acquisition-Related Expenses and
Restructuring Charge In-process research and development represents the value assigned in a
purchase business combination to research and development projects of the
acquired business that had commenced but had not reached technological
feasibility and has no alternative future use. In accordance with SFAS No2,
Accounting for Research and Development Costs, as clarified by FASB
Interpretation No4, amounts assigned to in-process research and development
meeting the above stated criteria must be charged to expense as part of the
allocation of the purchase price of the business combination. Accordingly, a
charge totaling $1,470,000 was recorded during 2002 as part of the allocation
of the purchase price related to the acquisition of Logistics.com. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company recorded expenses of
approximately $885,000 relating to fees incurred in connection with two
potential acquisitions that the Company decided not to consummate. The
acquisition-related expenses are presented as a separate line item in the
consolidated statements of income. The expenses consist primarily of legal,
accounting and travel expenses associated with the two transactions. During the second quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a restructuring
charge relating to an internal reorganization of $893,000. The restructuring
charge is presented as a separate line item in the consolidated statements of
income. The reorganization more closely aligns the Companys customer
advocates with implementation teams, and the customer support organization
with the technical teams. The charge consists primarily of one-time severance
payments to 25 employees. The Company anticipates no further costs relating to
this reorganization.
