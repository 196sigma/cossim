statements.                    37 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note A. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
1.  General Information
On August 25, 1999, BEC Energy BEC and Commonwealth Energy System COM/Energy
completed a merger to create a new holding company, NSTAR, an energy delivery
company serving approximately 13 million customers in Massachusetts including
more than one million electric customers in 81 communities and 240,000 gas
customers in 51 communities. NSTAR also supplies electricity at wholesale for
resale to municipalities. NSTAR is an exempt public utility holding company
under the provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. NSTAR
utility subsidiaries include Boston Edison Company, Commonwealth Electric
Company, Cambridge Electric Light Company, Canal Electric Company and
Commonwealth Gas Company. NSTAR non-utility operations include
telecommunications, district heating and cooling operations and liquefied
natural gas services.
NSTAR is focusing its utility operations on the transmission and distribution of
energy. This is illustrated by the sale of the majority of NSTAR subsidiaries
fossil generating assets and the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station.
2.  Basis of Consolidation and Accounting
The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the results of
operations, comprehensive income and cash flows of NSTAR and its subsidiaries.
All significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated. Certain
reclassifications have been made to the prior year data to conform with the
current presentation.
NSTAR utility subsidiaries follow accounting policies prescribed by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC and the Massachusetts Department of
Telecommunications and Energy MDTE. In addition, NSTAR and its subsidiaries
are subject to the accounting and reporting requirements of the Securities and
Exchange Commission SEC. The accompanying consolidated financial statements
conform with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP. The rate-regulated
subsidiaries are subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71,
Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation SFAS 71. The
application of SFAS 71 results in differences in the timing of recognition of
certain expenses from that of other businesses and industries. The distribution
business remains subject to rate-regulation and continues to meet the criteria
for application of SFAS 71. Refer to Note E to these Consolidated Financial
Statements for more information on the accounting implications of the electric
utility industry restructuring.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires NSTAR
and its subsidiaries to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from these estimates.                    38 3.  Revenues
Estimates of transmission and distribution revenues for electricity and natural
gas used by customers but not yet billed are recorded at the end of each
accounting period.
4.  Utility Plant
Utility plant is stated at original cost of construction. The costs of
replacements of property units are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs and
replacements of minor items are expensed as incurred. The original cost of
property retired, net of salvage value, and the related costs of removal are
charged to accumulated depreciation.
5.  Depreciation
Depreciation of utility plant is computed on a straight-line basis using
composite rates based on the estimated useful lives of the various classes of
property. The overall composite depreciation rates were 331%, 328% and 330%
in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Depreciation of nonutility property is
computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset.
6.  Costs Associated with Issuance and Redemption of Debt and Preferred Stock
Consistent with the recovery in utility rates, discounts, redemption premiums
and related costs associated with the issuance and redemption of long-term debt
and preferred stock are deferred. The costs related to long-term debt are
recognized as an addition to interest expense over the life of the original or
replacement debt. Consistent with an accounting order received from the FERC,
costs related to preferred stock issuances and redemptions are reflected as a
direct reduction to retained earnings upon redemption or over the average life
of the replacement preferred stock series as applicable.
7.  Allowance for Borrowed Funds Used During Construction AFUDC
AFUDC represents the estimated costs to finance utility plant construction. In
accordance with regulatory accounting, AFUDC is included as a cost of utility
plant and a reduction of current interest charges. Although AFUDC is not a
current source of cash income, the costs are recovered from customers over the
service life of the related plant in the form of increased revenues collected as
a result of higher depreciation expense. Average AFUDC rates in 1999, 1998 and
1997 were 582%, 588% and 604%, respectively, and represented only the cost of
short-term debt.
8.  Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid securities with
maturities of 90 days or less when purchased. Restricted cash represents the net
proceeds from the sale of Canal Electric Company generation assets that are
being used to reduce the transition costs that otherwise would be billed to
customers.
9.  Equity Method of Accounting
NSTAR uses the equity method of accounting for investments in corporate joint
ventures in which it does not have a controlling interest. Under this                    39 method, it records as income or loss the proportionate share of the net earnings
or losses of the joint ventures with a corresponding increase or decrease in the
carrying value of the investment. The investment is reduced as cash dividends
are received.
10. Regulatory Assets
Regulatory assets represent costs incurred that are expected to be collected
from customers through future charges in accordance with agreements with
regulators. These costs are expensed when the corresponding revenues are
received in order to appropriately match revenues and expenses.
Regulatory assets consist of the following                                   December 31,

Note B. Merger of BEC Energy and Commonwealth Energy System
Shareholders of BEC and COM/Energy approved the merger on June 24, 1999. After
receiving various regulatory approvals, the SEC issued its approval of the
merger and the transaction was completed on August 24, 1999. Pursuant to the
merger agreement, BEC shareholders received approximately 41 million shares of
NSTAR, while COM/Energy shareholders received approximately 20 million shares of
NSTAR. In addition, BEC and COM/Energy shareholders received an aggregate amount
of cash of approximately $300 million. An initial quarterly dividend rate of
485 cents per share of NSTAR was declared by the board of trustees on September
23, 1999 and paid on November 1, 1999. This dividend rate is reviewed on a
regular basis and on December 16, 1999 a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per
share was declared.
The merger of BEC and COM/Energy has been accounted for as an acquisition of
COM/Energy by BEC using the purchase method of accounting. Under this method,
the accompanying consolidated financial statements of NSTAR include the results
of BEC for years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 consolidated with those of
COM/Energy from the date of the merger August 25, 1999. Goodwill amounted to
approximately $486 million while the original estimate of costs to achieve the
merger was $111 million. Goodwill is being amortized over 40 years and will
amount to approximately $122 million annually while the cost to achieve is
being amortized over 10 years and will initially be approximately $111 million
annually. The ultimate amortization of the cost to achieve will reflect the
total actual costs.
Based on unaudited data, the following pro forma summary presents the
consolidated results of operations for years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998                    40 as if the merger had occurred at the beginning of the years presented. These
results do not reflect future cost savings or avoidances expected from the
merger.

Note C. Earnings Per Common Share
Basic earnings per common share EPS is calculated by dividing net income,
after deductions for preferred dividends, by the weighted average common shares
outstanding during the year. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
128, Earnings per Share, requires the disclosure of diluted EPS. Diluted EPS
is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the weighted average
common shares is increased to include the number of dilutive potential common
shares. Diluted EPS reflects the impact on shares outstanding of the deferred
nonvested shares and stock options granted under the NSTAR Stock Incentive
Plan.

41 Note D. RCN Joint Venture and Investment Conversion
Boston Energy Technology Group BETG, a subsidiary of NSTAR through NSTAR
Communications, Inc. NSTAR COMformerly known as BecoCom,Inc. is a
participant in a telecommunications venture with RCN Telecom Services, Inc. of
Massachusetts RCN. NSTAR accounts for its investment in the joint venture
using the equity method of accounting. As part of the joint venture agreement,
NSTAR has the option to exchange portions of its joint venture interest for
shares of RCN common stock at specified periods. During 1998, NSTAR exercised
its option to convert a portion of its interest. In the first quarter of 1999,
NSTAR received 11 million shares of RCN common stock in exchange for a portion
of its joint venture interest that had a book value of $11 million. The RCN
shares received are included in other investments on the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value of approximately $54 million at
December 31, 1999. The unrealized gain due to the increase in fair value on
these shares since they were received is reflected, net of associated income
taxes, as comprehensive income on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Comprehensive Income and the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Note E. Electric Utility Industry Restructuring
1.  Accounting Implications
Under the traditional revenue requirements model, electric rates have been based
on the cost of providing electric service. Under this model, NSTAR retail
electric companies have been subject to certain accounting standards that are
not applicable to other businesses and industries in general. The application of
SFAS 71 requires companies to defer the recognition of certain costs when
incurred if future rate recovery of these costs is expected. As a result of the
Massachusetts Electric Restructuring Law enacted in November 1997 and the MDTE
order regarding retail electric companies settlement agreement, as of December
31, 1997, the provisions of SFAS 71 were no longer being applied to Boston
Edison generation business. NSTAR remaining generation business, Canal
Electric Company 352% ownership interest in the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant
is subject to the provisions of SFAS 71.
The implementation of electric utility industry restructuring had certain
accounting implications. The highlights of these include a.  Generation-related plant and other regulatory assets
Plant and other regulatory assets related to the generation business, are
recovered through the transition charge. This recovery, which includes a return,
occurs over a 12 year period for Boston Edison and an 11 year period for the
former COM/Energy retail electric companies that began on March 1, 1998 the
retail access date.
b.  Fuel and purchased power charge
The fuel and purchased power charge ceased as of the retail access date. The net
remaining over-collection of fuel and purchased power costs is being returned to
customers through March 31, 2000. These over-recovered costs are included as an
offset to the settlement recovery mechanisms, which is included in regulatory
assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.                    42 c.  Standard offer charge
Customers have the option of continuing to buy power from the retail electric
delivery businesses at standard offer prices as of the retail access date. The
cost of providing standard offer service, which includes fuel and purchased
power costs, is recovered from standard offer customers on a fully reconciling
basis.
d.  Distribution and transmission charges
An integral part of the merger is the rate plan that was filed by the retail
utility subsidiaries of BEC and COM/Energy and approved by the MDTE on July 27,
1999. Significant elements of the rate plan include a four-year distribution
rate freeze, recovery of the acquisition premium goodwill over 40 years and
recovery of transaction and integration costs costs to achieve over 10 years.
Boston Edison distribution rates are subject to a minimum and maximum return on
average common equity ROE from its distribution business through December 31,
2000. The ROE is subject to a floor of 6% and a ceiling of 1175%. If the ROE is
below 6%, Boston Edison is authorized to add a surcharge to distribution rates
in order to achieve the 6% floor. If the ROE is above 11%, it is required to
adjust distribution rates by an amount necessary to reduce the calculated ROE
between 11% and 125% by 50%, and a return above 125% by 100%. No adjustment is
made if the ROE is between 6% and 11%. In addition, distribution rates will be
adjusted for any changes in tax laws or accounting principles that result in a
change in costs of more than $1 million. The cost of providing transmission
service to all NSTAR electric distribution customers is recovered on a fully
reconciling basis.
2.  Generating Assets Divestiture
On July 13, 1999, Boston Edison completed the sale of the Pilgrim Nuclear
Generating Station to Entergy Nuclear Generating Company, a subsidiary of
Entergy Corporation, for $81 million. In addition to the amount received from
the buyer, Boston Edison has received a total of approximately $158 million from
the Pilgrim contract customers, including $103 million from Commonwealth
Electric Company, to terminate their contracts. Approximately $80 million
remains to be collected under these termination agreements. As part of the sale,
Boston Edison transferred its decommissioning trust fund to Entergy for
decommissioning of the plant. In order to provide Entergy with a fully funded
decommissioning trust fund, Boston Edison contributed approximately $271 million
to the fund at the time of the sale. As a result of a favorable IRS tax ruling,
Boston Edison received $43 million from Entergy reflecting a reduction in the
required decommissioning funding. The difference between the total proceeds
received and the net book value of the Pilgrim assets sold plus the net amount
to fully fund the decommissioning trust is included in the balance of
generation-related regulatory assets, net on the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets as such amounts are being collected from customers under Boston
Edison settlement agreement. The final amounts to be collected from customers
related to Pilgrim are subject to regulatory review.
Completion of the sale of Boston Edison fossil generating assets took place in
May 1998. Boston Edison received proceeds from the sale of $674 million,
including $121 million for a six-month transitional power purchase contract.                    43 The amount received above net book value on the sale of these assets is being
returned to Boston Edison customers over the settlement period.
On July 27, 1999 BEC Funding LLC, a subsidiary of NSTAR, closed the sale of $725
million of notes to a special purpose trust created by two Massachusetts state
agencies. The trust then concurrently closed the sale of $725 million of
electric rate reduction certificates to the public. The certificates are secured
by a portion of the transition charge assessed on Boston Edison retail
customers as permitted under the Massachusetts Electric Restructuring Law and
authorized by the MDTE. These certificates are non-recourse to Boston Edison.
COM/Energy completed the sale of substantially all of its investment in electric
generation assets in 1998. Proceeds from the sale of these assets, after
construction-related adjustments at the closing that occurred on December 30,
1998, amounted to approximately $4539 million or 61 times their book value of
approximately $742 million. The proceeds from the sale, net of book value,
transaction costs and certain other adjustments, amounted to $3586 million and
is being used to reduce transition costs related to electric industry
restructuring that otherwise would have been collected from customers.
COM/Energy established Energy Investment Services, Inc. EIS as the vehicle to
invest the net proceeds from the sale of Canal Electric Company generation
assets. These proceeds have been invested in a portfolio of securities that is
designed to maintain principal and earn a reasonable return. Both the principal
amount and income earned will be used to reduce the transition costs that would
otherwise be billed to customers of Cambridge Electric Light Company and
Commonwealth Electric Company. The net proceeds have been classified as
restricted cash on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Note F. Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109. SFAS 109
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future
tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax
basis of assets and liabilities. In accordance with SFAS 109, net regulatory
assets of $711 million and $522 million and corresponding net increases in
accumulated deferred income taxes were recorded as of December 31, 1999 and
1998, respectively. The regulatory assets represent the additional future
revenues to be collected from customers for deferred income taxes.
Accumulated deferred income taxes consisted of the following                                  December 31,

in 1998 of investment tax credits recognized as a result of generation
divestitures. Excluding these shareholder benefits, the effective tax rate would
have been approximately 39% in each year.
Note G. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits
Effective December 31, 1999, the pension and other postretirement benefit plans
of BEC and COM/Energy were combined under NSTAR.
1.  Pensions
NSTAR has a defined benefit funded retirement plan with certain contributory
features that covers substantially all employees. NSTAR also maintains an
unfunded supplemental retirement plan for certain management employees.
Effective January 1, 2000, the defined benefit plan was amended to provide
management employees lump sum benefits under a final average pay pension equity
formula. Prior to January 1, 2000 these pension benefits were provided under a
traditional final average pay formula. This amendment is reflected in the
December 31, 1999 benefit obligation.                    45 The changes in benefit obligation and plan assets were as follows                                  December 31,

divestiture, amounts recognized for curtailment, settlement and special
termination benefit costs were $19,823,000, $930,000 and $15,712,000,
respectively, for 1999. As a result of the nuclear divestiture, amounts
recognized for curtailment and special termination benefit costs were $2,705,000
and $665,000 respectively for 1998. The amounts resulting from the
merger-related separation packages are recoverable as part of the approved rate
plans of the retail utility subsidiaries of NSTAR. The amounts resulting from
the nuclear divestiture are recoverable under the Boston Edison settlement
agreement.
NSTAR also provides defined contribution 401k plans for substantially all
employees. Matching contributions included in the Consolidated Statements of
Income amounted to $9 million in 1999 and $8 million in 1998 and 1997,
respectively.
2.  Other Postretirement Benefits
In addition to pension benefits, NSTAR also provides health care and other
benefits to retired employees who meet certain age and years of service
eligibility requirements. These benefits include health and life insurance
coverage and reimbursement of certain Medicare premiums. Under certain
circumstances, eligible employees are required to make contributions for
postretirement benefits. Effective January 1, 2000 the plan was amended to
include certain new managed care features. This amendment is reflected in the
December 31, 1999 benefit obligation.

Note H. Stock-Based Compensation
In 1997, Boston Edison initiated a Stock Incentive Plan the Plan that was
adopted by the board of directors and approved by common stockholders and
subsequently approved for all eligible NSTAR subsidiary company employees. The
Plan permits a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including stock options
and deferred nonvested stock to be granted to certain key employees. The Plan
limits the terms of awards to ten years. Subject to adjustment for stock-splits
and similar events, the aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be
delivered under the Plan is 2,000,000, including shares issued in lieu of or
upon reinvestment of dividends arising from awards. During 1999, 58,500 shares
of deferred stock and 248,000 ten-year non-qualified stock options were granted.
During 1998, 19,150 shares of deferred stock and 419,200 ten-year non-qualified
stock options were granted under the Plan. During 1997, 73,820 shares of
deferred stock and 298,400 ten-year non-qualified stock options were granted.
The weighted average grant date fair value of the deferred stock issued during
1999, 1998 and 1997 was $4173, $3975 and $2726, respectively. The options
were granted at the full market price of the stock on the date of the grant. All
the awards vest ratably over a three-year period.
Compensation cost for stock-based awards is computed by measuring the quoted
stock market price at the measurement date less the amount, if any, an employee
is required to pay. The fair value disclosures were as follows in thousands, except per share amounts        1999    1998    1997

Note M. Commitments and Contingencies
1.  Contractual Commitments
As December 31, 1999, NSTAR and its subsidiaries had estimated contractual
obligations for plant and equipment of approximately $347 million.                    55 NSTAR also had leases for certain facilities and equipment. The estimated
minimum rental commitments under both transmission agreements and non-cancelable
operating leases for the years after 1999 are as follows in thousands
- 
2000                  $ 25,649
2001                   22,485
2002                   20,436
2003                   17,142
2004                   16,351
Years thereafter             108,302
- 
Total               $ 210,365
The total expense for both lease rentals and transmission agreements was $387
million in 1999, $296 million in 1998 and $275 million in 1997, net of
capitalized expenses of $15 million in 1999, $16 million in 1998 and $12
million in 1997.
Total rent expense for all operating leases, except those with terms of a month
or less, amounted to $108 million in 1999, $115 million in 1998 and $112
million in 1997.
2.  Electric Company Investments
NSTAR has an equity investment of approximately 145% in two companies that own
and operate transmission facilities to import electricity from the Hydro-Quebec
system in Canada. As an equity participant NSTAR is required to guarantee, in
addition to its own share, the total obligations of those participants who do
not meet certain credit criteria. At December 31, 1999, NSTAR portion of these
guarantees was $18 million.
NSTAR also has a 25% equity investment in the 540 MW Vermont Yankee nuclear
power plant. Vermont Yankee has developed its estimate of the cost of
decommissioning its unit and has received the approval of FERC to include
charges for the estimated costs of decommissioning its unit in the cost of
energy that it sells. Periodically, Vermont Yankee re-estimates the cost of
decommissioning and applies to FERC for increased rates in response to increased
decommissioning costs. The Vermont Yankee unit is under agreement to be sold to
Amergen Energy Company. NSTAR is currently entitled to electricity produced from
the remaining facility based on its ownership interest and is billed for its
entitlement pursuant to a contractual agreement that is approved by the FERC.
The estimated cost to decommission this plant is $4287 million in current
dollars. NSTAR share of this liability approximately $107 million, less its
share of the market value of the assets held in a decommissioning trust
approximately $62 million, is approximately $45 million at December 31,
1999.
NSTAR has a 14% equity investment in Yankee Atomic Electric Company Yankee
Atomic. In 1992, the board of directors of Yankee Atomic voted to discontinue
operations of the Yankee Atomic nuclear generating station permanently and
decommission the facility.
Yankee Atomic received approval from the FERC to continue to collect its
investment and decommissioning costs through 2000, the period of the plant
operating license. The estimate of NSTAR share of Yankee Atomic investment
and costs of decommissioning is approximately $45 million as of                    56 December 31, 1999. These estimates are recorded on the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets as a power contract liability and an offsetting regulatory asset.
NSTAR also has a 14% equity investment in Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power
Company CYAPC. In 1996 the board of directors of CYAPC, which owns and
operates the Connecticut Yankee nuclear electric generating unit Connecticut
Yankee, unanimously voted to retire the unit. NSTAR share of Connecticut
Yankee remaining investment and estimated costs of decommissioning is
approximately $42 million as of December 31, 1999. This estimate is recorded on
the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as a power contract liability and
an offsetting regulatory asset similar to Yankee Atomic.
In December 1996, CYAPC filed for rate relief at the FERC seeking to recover
certain post-operating costs, including decommissioning. In August 1998, the
FERC Administrative Law Judge ALJ released an initial decision regarding
CYAPC filing. This decision called for the disallowance of the common equity
return on the CYAPC investment subsequent to the shutdown. The decision also
stated that decommissioning collections should continue to be based on a
previously approved estimate, with an adjustment for inflation, until a more
reliable estimate is developed. In October 1998, both CYAPC and Northeast
Utilities, a 49% equity investor in CYAPC, filed briefs on exceptions to the ALJ
decision. The case is still pending before the FERC. If the initial decision is
upheld by the FERC, CYAPC could be required to write off a portion of its
investment in the generating unit and refund a portion of the previously
collected return on investment to ratepayers. Management is currently unable to
determine the ultimate outcome of this proceeding. However, the estimate of the
effect of the ALJ initial decision does not have a material impact on its
consolidated financial position or results of operations.
NSTAR has a 4% equity investment in the Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company Maine
Yankee. In 1997 the board of directors of Maine Yankee voted to discontinue
operations of the Maine Yankee nuclear generating station permanently and
decommission the facility.
NSTAR share of Maine Yankee remaining decommissioning is approximately $28
million as of December 31, 1999. This estimate is recorded on the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets as a power contract liability and an offsetting
regulatory asset.
3.  Nuclear Insurance
Under the Price-Anderson Act the Act, owners of nuclear power plants have the
benefit of approximately $95 billion of public liability coverage that would
compensate the public for covered bodily injury and property loss in the event
of an accident at a commercial nuclear power plant. The first $200 million of
nuclear liability is covered by commercial insurance. Additional nuclear
liability insurance up to $93 billion is provided by a retrospective assessment
of up to $881 million per incident levied on each of the 106 nuclear generating
units currently licensed to operate in the United States, with a maximum
assessment of $10 million per incident per year.
NSTAR has an equity ownership interest in four nuclear generating facilities as
well as a 352% joint-ownership interest in Seabrook 1. The operators of these
units maintain nuclear insurance coverage on behalf of the owners of                    57 the facilities with either Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited NEIL, a
combination of NEIL and the American Nuclear Insurers ANI or ANI only
depending on the limit of insurance required to be maintained. NEIL provides
$225 billion of property, boiler, machinery and decontamination insurance
coverage, including accidental premature decommissioning insurance. All
companies insured with NEIL are subject to retroactive assessments. ANI provides
$500 million of all risk property damage, boiler, machinery and
decontamination insurance. Three of the four units in which NSTAR has an equity
ownership interest have permanently ceased operations. The Nuclear Regulatory
Commission has approved each of these units' requests to withdraw from
participation in the financial protection insurance program of the act and
reduce their limits of property insurance.
Based on its various ownership interests in the five nuclear generating
facilities, NSTAR retrospective premium could be $600,000 annually or a
cumulative total of $53 million under the Act.
4.  Environmental Matters
The utility subsidiaries of NSTAR are involved in approximately 30 properties
where oil or hazardous materials were previously spilled or released. As such,
the companies are required to clean up these remaining properties in accordance
with a timetable developed by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection. There are uncertainties associated with these costs due to the
complexities of cleanup technology, regulatory requirements and the particular
characteristics of the different sites. NSTAR subsidiaries also face possible
liability as a potentially responsible party in the cleanup of six multi-party
hazardous waste sites in Massachusetts and other states where it is alleged to
have generated, transported or disposed of hazardous waste at the sites. NSTAR
currently expects to have only a small percentage of the total potential
liability for these sites. Approximately $66 million is included in the
December 31, 1999 Consolidated Balance Sheets related to these cleanup
liabilities. Management is unable to fully determine a range of reasonably
possible cleanup costs in excess of the accrued amount. Based on its assessments
of the specific site circumstances, management does not believe that it is
probable that any such additional costs will have a material impact on NSTAR
consolidated financial position. However, it is reasonably possible that
additional provisions for cleanup costs that may result from a change in
estimates could have a material impact on the results of a reporting period in
the near term.
Public concern continues regarding Electro Magnetic Fields EMF associated with
electric transmission and distribution facilities and appliances and wiring in
buildings and homes. Such concerns have included the possibility of adverse
health effects caused by EMF as well as perceived effects on property values.
NSTAR continues to support research into the subject and participates in the
funding of industry-sponsored studies. It is aware that public concern regarding
EMF in some cases has resulted in litigation, in opposition to existing or
proposed facilities in proceedings before regulators or in requests for
legislation or regulatory standards concerning EMF levels. It has addressed
issues relative to EMF in various legal and regulatory proceedings and in
discussions with customers and other concerned persons. However, to date it has
not been significantly affected by these developments. NSTAR continues to
monitor all aspects of the EMF issue.
ComGas is participating in the assessment of a number of former Manufactured Gas
Plant MGP sites and alleged MGP waste disposal locations to determine                    58 if and to what extent such sites have been contaminated and whether ComGas may
be responsible for remedial action. As of December 31, 1999, ComGas has recorded
a liability and corresponding regulatory asset amounting to $22 million as an
estimate for site cleanup costs for several MGP sites for which ComGas was
previously cited as a Potentially Responsible Party. The MDTE has approved
recovery of costs associated with MGP sites.
Estimates related to environmental remediation costs are reviewed and adjusted
periodically as further investigation and assignment of responsibility occurs.
NSTAR is unable to estimate its ultimate liability for future environmental
remediation costs. However, in view of NSTAR current assessment of its
environmental responsibilities, existing legal requirements and regulatory
policies, management does not believe that these matters will have material
adverse effect on NSTAR results of operations or financial position.
5.  Generating Unit Performance Program
The MDTE generating unit performance programs ceased March 1, 1998. Under
these programs the recovery of incremental purchased power costs resulting from
generating unit outages occurring through the retail access date was subject to
review by the MDTE. However, proceedings relative to generating unit performance
remain pending before the MDTE. These proceedings will include the review of
replacement power costs associated with the shutdown of the Connecticut Yankee
nuclear electric generating unit that is discussed in item 2. Management is
unable to fully determine a range of reasonably possible disallowance costs in
excess of amounts accrued. Based on its assessment of the information currently
available, management does not believe that it is probable that any such
additional costs will have a material impact on NSTAR consolidated financial
position. However, it is reasonably possible that additional provisions for
disallowance costs that may result from a change in estimates could have a
material impact on the results of a reporting period in the near term.
6.  Legal Proceedings
Industry and corporate restructuring legal proceedings
The MDTE order approving the Boston Edison restructuring settlement agreement
was appealed by certain parties to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. One
settlement agreement appeal remains pending; however, there has to date been no
briefing, hearing or other action taken with respect to this proceeding.
In addition, along with other Massachusetts investor-owned utilities, NSTAR
utility subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in a class action suit
seeking to declare certain provisions of the Massachusetts electric industry
restructuring legislation unconstitutional.
Management is currently unable to determine the outcome of these outstanding
proceedings. However, if an unfavorable outcome were to occur, there could be a
material adverse impact on business operations, the consolidated financial
position or results of operations for a reporting period.                    59 Regulatory proceedings
In October 1997, the MDTE opened a proceeding to investigate Boston Edison
compliance with the 1993 order that permitted the formation of BETG and
authorized Boston Edison to invest up to $45 million in unregulated activities.
Hearings were completed in the first half of 1999.
Management is currently unable to determine the outcome of this proceeding.
However, if an unfavorable outcome were to occur, there could be a material
adverse impact on business operations, the consolidated financial position or
results of operations for a reporting period.
Other litigation
In October 1998, the town of Plymouth, Massachusetts, the site of Pilgrim
Station, filed suit against Boston Edison. The town claimed that Boston Edison
had wrongfully failed to execute an agreement with the town for payments in
addition to taxes due to the town under the Massachusetts Electric Restructuring
Law. Boston Edison and the town settled the suit and agreed on a 15-year $141
million property tax package in March 1999. Payments in each of the first four
years are approximately $15 million after which payments gradually decline. All
payments under this agreement will be recovered from customers through the
transition charge.
In the normal course of its business NSTAR and its subsidiaries are also
involved in certain other legal matters. Management is unable to fully determine
a range of reasonably possible legal costs in excess of amounts accrued. Based
on the information currently available, it does not believe that it is probable
that any such additional costs will have a material impact on its consolidated
financial position. However, it is reasonably possible that additional legal
costs that may result from a change in estimates could have a material impact on
the results of a reporting period in the near term.
Note N. Long-Term Power Contracts for the Purchase of Electricity
1.  Energy Agreements
NSTAR on behalf of Boston Edison, Cambridge Electric Light Company and
ComElectric entered into a six-month agreement effective January 1, 2000 to
transfer all of the unit output entitlements in long-term power purchase
contracts to Select Energy Select, a subsidiary of Northeast Utilities. In
return, Select will provide full energy service requirements, including NEPOOL
capability responsibilities, at FERC approved tariff rates through June 30,
2000. NSTAR 1999 proportionate share of capacity and total cost reflects four
months of the COM/Energy subsidiaries from the date of the merger.                    60 Information relating to the contracts as of December 31, 1999 is as follows                            proportionate share in thousands
