Darling International Inc. We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Darling International
Inc. and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index. In connection with
our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
financial statement schedule as listed in the accompanying index. These
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly,  in all material  respects,  the financial  position of Darling
International Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 1, 2000 and January 2, 1999,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended January 1, 2000, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.                          KPMG LLP Dallas, Texas

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
January 1, 2000 and January 2, 1999
1  GENERAL
a   NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Darling International Inc. the Company believes it is the largest
publicly traded recycler of food processing by-products in the United
States, operating a fleet of vehicles, through which it collects
animal by-products and used restaurant cooking oil from butcher
shops, grocery stores, independent meat and poultry processors and
restaurants nationwide. The Company processes raw materials through
facilities  located throughout the United States into finished
products, such as tallow, meat and bone meal, and yellow grease. The
Company sells its finished products domestically and internationally
to producers of soap, cosmetics, rubber, pet food and livestock feed
for use as ingredients in such products.
On October 22, 1993, the Company entered into a settlement agreement
providing for a restructure of the Company debt and equity and
resolution of a class action lawsuit the Settlement. On December
29, 1993, the Settlement was consummated and became binding on all
original note holders. The Company has accounted for the Settlement
using Fresh Start Reporting as of January 1, 1994, in accordance
with Statement of Position 90-7, Financial Reporting by Entities in
Reorganization Under the United States Bankruptcy Code issued by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Using a valuation
of the Company performed by an independent appraiser, the Company
determined the total reorganization value of all its assets to be
approximately $236,294,000 as of January 1, 1994 and the Company
accumulated deficit was eliminated as of January 1, 1994.
b SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
1 Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
As disclosed in Note 15, the operations of IPC, as defined
below, are classified as discontinued operations.
2 Fiscal Year
The Company has a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday
nearest December 31. Fiscal years for the consolidated financial
statements included herein are for the 52 weeks ended January 1,
2000, the 52 weeks ended January 2, 1999, and the 53 weeks ended
January 3, 1998.
3 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
4 Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation
is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of assets: 1 Buildings and improvements - 24 to 30
years; 2 Machinery and equipment - 3 to 8 years; and 3
Vehicles - 4 to 6 years.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and
expenditures  for  major  renewals  and  improvements  are
capitalized.
5 Collection Routes and Contracts
Collection  routes,  restrictive  covenants and  consulting
agreements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the
straight-line method over periods ranging from 3 to 15 years.
6 Goodwill
Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over
fair value of net assets  acquired,  is  amortized on a
straight-line basis over the expected periods to be benefited,
not exceeding 30 years. Annually, the Company assesses the
recoverability of this intangible asset by determining whether
the amortization of the goodwill balance over its remaining life
can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash
flows of the acquired operation.  The amount of goodwill
impairment, if any, is measured based on projected discounted
future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the
Company  average cost of funds.  The assessment of the
recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated future
operating cash flows are not achieved.
7 Environmental Expenditures
Environmental expenditures incurred to mitigate or prevent
environmental contamination that has yet to occur and that
otherwise may result from future operations are capitalized.
Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past
operations and that do not contribute to current or future
revenues  are  expensed  or  charged  against  established
environmental  reserves.  Reserves  are  established  when
environmental  assessments and/or clean-up requirements are
probable and the costs are reasonably estimable.
8 Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and
liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.
9 Earnings Per Common Share
Basic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net
earnings  attributable to outstanding common stock by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
year. Diluted earnings per common share are computed by dividing
net earnings attributable to outstanding common stock by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
year increased by dilutive common equivalent shares stock
options determined using the treasury stock method, based on
the average market price exceeding the exercise price of the
stock options.
The weighted average common shares used for basic earnings per
common share was 15,589,000 15,581,000 and 15,519,000 for 1999,
1998 and 1997, respectively. The effect of dilutive stock
options added 942,000 shares for 1997 for the computation of
diluted earnings per common share. For 1999 and 1998 the effect
of all outstanding stock options were excluded from diluted
earnings per common share because the effect was anti-dilutive.     10  Stock Option Plans
The Company accounts for its stock option plan in accordance
with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
related interpretations.  As such, compensation expense is
recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price
of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price. Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, permits entities to recognize as
expense  over the vesting  period the fair value of all
stock-based awards on the date of grant. Alternatively, SFAS No.
123 allows entities to continue to apply the provisions of APB
Opinion No. 25 and provide pro forma net income and pro forma
earnings per share disclosures for employee stock option grants
made in 1995 and future years as if the fair-value-based method
defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied. The Company has
elected to continue to apply the provisions of APB Opinion No.
25 and provide the pro forma disclosure provisions of SFAS No.
123.
11 Statements of Cash Flows
The Company considers all short-term highly liquid instruments,
with an original maturity of three months or less, to be cash
equivalents.
12 Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally  accepted  accounting  principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
13 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets To Be
Disposed Of
The Company applies the provisions of SFAS No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of. This Statement  requires that
long-lived assets and certain identifiable  intangibles be
reviewed  for  impairment  whenever  events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used
is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset
to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to
be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets. Assets
to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying
amount or fair value less costs to sell.
In Fiscal 1999, the  Company recorded an impairment charge of
$1,387,000 to reduce the carrying value of certain land and
buildings not currently used in operations to estimated fair
value. The impairment charge is included in operating expenses
in the accompanying Fiscal 1999 Consolidated Statement of
Operations.
14 Financial Instruments
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates
fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.         The carrying amount for the Company outstanding borrowings
under the Credit Agreement and Term Loan described in note 9,
approximates the fair value due to the floating interest rates
on the borrowings.
The fair value of the interest rate swap  agreements was
$967,000 and $207,000 at January 1, 2000, and January 2,
1999, respectively. Current market pricing models were used to
estimate fair value of interest rate swap agreements. The Company
incurred additional interest expense of $913,400 and $670,300 in
Fiscal 1999 and 1998,  respectively,  related to the swap
agreements.
15  Derivative Instruments
The Company use of derivative instruments is limited to
interest rate swaps which are entered into with the intent of
managing overall borrowing costs. The Company does not use
derivative instruments for trading purposes.
For the periods presented, interest rate swaps are accounted for
under the accrual method, whereby the difference between the
Company pay and receive rate is recognized as an increase or
decrease to interest expense. The fair value of the swap
agreements and changes in fair value are not recognized in the
consolidated financial statements. 2 LIQUIDITY
The Company has experienced two consecutive years of operating losses and
reduced cash flow as compared to 1997. Management believes that, unless the
prices for the products the Company sells decline further, the Company
cash flow from operations and availability of credit under the Revolver
see note 9 should enable the Company to meet its Fiscal 2000 obligations
in the ordinary course of business. However, if prices for finished goods
the Company sells were to materially decline below those prevailing in
Fiscal 1999, the Company might be forced to seek further covenant waivers
under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement in 2000. 3 ACQUISITIONS
During Fiscal 1997, as part of the Company strategy to expand its
presence in restaurant grease collection and the grease trap business, the
Company made the following acquisitions: Enduro, Midwest Recycling, and
Torvac, totaling $117 million which included goodwill acquired of $22
million. 4 INVENTORIES

CREDIT AGREEMENT
Effective June 5, 1997, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement the
Credit Agreement which originally provided for borrowings in the form
of a $50,000,000 Term Loan and $175,000,000 Revolving Credit Facility. On
October 3, 1998, the Company entered into an amendment of the Credit
Agreement whereby BankBoston, N.A., as agent, and the other participant
banks in the Credit Agreement the Banks agreed to forbear from
exercising rights and remedies arising as a result of several existing
events of default of certain financial covenants the Defaults under
the Credit Agreement, as amended, until November 9, 1998.
On November 6, 1998, the Company entered into an extension of the
Amendment whereby the Banks agreed to forbear from exercising rights and
remedies arising as a result of the Defaults until December 14, 1998. The
forbearance period was subsequently extended to January 22, 1999. On
January 22, 1999, the Company and the banks entered into an Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for borrowing in the
form of a $36,702,000 Term Loan and $135,000,000 Revolving Credit
Facility.
The Term Loan provides for $36,702,000 of borrowing. Under the Credit
Agreement, the Term Loan bore interest, payable monthly at LIBOR plus a
margin the Credit Margin. Under the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement, the Term Loan bears interest, payable quarterly, at a Base
Rate 850% at January 1, 2000 plus a margin of 1%. As of January 1,
2000, $7,720,000 was outstanding under the Term Loan, with $3,516,000 due
on June 30, 2000, $2,500,000 due on September 30, 2000, and the balance
due on December 31, 2000.
The Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to a maximum of
$135,000,000 with sublimits available for letters of credit and a
swingline. Under the Credit Agreement, outstanding borrowings on the
Revolving Credit Facility bore interest, payable monthly, at various
LIBOR rates plus the Credit Margin as well as portions at a Base Rate or,
for swingline advances, at the Base Rate. Under the Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility bears interest, payable
quarterly, at a Base Rate 850% at January 1, 2000 plus a margin of 1%.
Additionally, the Company must pay a commitment fee equal to 0375% per
annum on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. Under the
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility
provides for a mandatory reduction of $2,500,000 on March 31, 2001, with
the remaining balance due at maturity on June 30, 2001. As of January 1,
2000, $110,179,000 was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.
As of January 1, 2000, the Company had outstanding irrevocable letters of
credit aggregating $11,233,000.
Substantially all assets of the Company are either pledged or mortgaged
as collateral for borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains certain
terms and covenants, which, among other matters, restrict the incurrence
of additional indebtedness, the payment of cash dividends, the retention
of certain proceeds from sales of assets, and the annual amount of
capital expenditures, and requires the maintenance of certain minimum
financial ratios. As of January 1, 2000, no cash dividends could be paid
to the Company stockholders pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement.
The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments
and does not use them for trading purposes. Interest rate swap agreements
are used to reduce the potential impact of increases in interest rates on
floating-rate long-term debt. At January 1, 2000, the Company was party
to three interest rate swap agreements. Under the terms of the swap
agreements, the interest obligation on $70 million of Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement floating-rate debt was exchanged for fixed rate
contracts which bear interest, payable quarterly. One swap agreement for
$25 million matures June 27, 2002, bears interest at 65925% and the
Company receive rate is based on the three-month LIBOR. A second swap
agreement for $25 million matures June 27, 2001, bears interest at 983%
and the Company receive rate is based on the Base Rate. The third swap
agreement for $20 million matures on June 27, 2002, with a one-time
option for the bank to cancel at June 27, 2001, bears interest at 917%
and the Company receive rate is based on the Base Rate.

The portion of the deferred tax assets and liabilities expected to be
recognized in Fiscal 2000 has been recorded at January 1, 2000, in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet as a net current deferred income
tax asset of $4,203,000. The remaining non-current deferred tax assets
and liabilities have been recorded as a net deferred income tax liability
of $3,990,000 at January 1, 2000 in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet.
The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of January 1, 2000 and
January 2, 1999 was $20,305,000 and $20,616,000, respectively. The net
changes in the total valuation allowance for the years ended January 1,
2000 and January 2, 1999 was a decrease of $311,000 and an increase of
$1,144,000. The Company believes that the remaining net deferred tax
assets at January 1, 2000 and January 2, 1999 will be realized primarily
through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences.
At January 1, 2000, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for
federal income tax purposes of approximately $96,025,000 which are
available to offset future federal taxable income through 2019 and
capital loss carryforwards of approximately  $14,264,000 which are
available to offset capital gains through 2004. The availability of the
net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future taxable income is
subject to various limitations. As a result of the change in ownership,
the Company believes utilization of its pre-1994 net operating loss
carryforwards $75,154,000 is limited to $3,400,000 per year for the
remaining life of the net operating losses.
The Company reports tax benefits utilized related to the January 1, 1994
valuation allowance $185,000 in 1998 as a direct addition to additional
paid-in capital.
12  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
At December 29, 1993, the Company granted options to purchase 384,615
shares of the Company common stock to the former owners of the
Redeemable Preferred Stock. The options have a term of ten years from the
date of grant and may be exercised at a price of $345 per share
approximated market value at the date of grant.
The 1993 Flexible Stock Option Plan and the 1994 Employee Flexible Stock
Option Plan provide for the granting of stock options to key officers and
salaried employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Options to
purchase common stock were granted at a price approximating fair market
value at the date of grant. Options granted under the plans expire ten
years from the date of grant. Vesting occurs on each anniversary of the
grant date as defined in the specific option agreement. The plans also
provide for the acceleration by one year of vesting of all non-vested
shares upon the termination of the employee employment in certain
circumstances or upon a change in management control.
The Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan provides for the granting of
options to non-employee directors of the Company. As of January 1, 2000,
options to purchase 447,000 shares of common stock had been granted
pursuant to this plan. The options have a term of ten years from the date
of grant and may be exercised at a price of $175 - $9042 per share
market value at the date of grant. The options vest 25% six months
after the grant date and 25% on each anniversary date thereafter.
The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted during
1999, 1998, and 1997 was $165, $557 and $734, respectively, on the
date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the
following weighted assumptions                     1999      1998      1997

options in the financial statements as stock options were granted at
market value on the grant date. Had the Company determined compensation
cost based on the fair value at the grant date for its stock options
under SFAS No. 123, the Company earnings loss from continuing
operations would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated

At January 1, 2000 and January 2, 1999, the number of options exercisable
was 1,928,958 and 2,443,745, respectively, and the weighted-average
exercise price of those options was $550 and $525, respectively. 13  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has retirement and pension plans covering substantially all
of its employees. Most retirement benefits are provided by the Company
under separate final-pay noncontributory pension plans for all salaried
and hourly employees excluding those covered by union-sponsored plans
who meet service and age requirements. Benefits are based principally on
length of service and earnings patterns during the five years preceding
retirement.
The Company funding policy for those plans is to contribute annually
not less than the minimum amount required nor more than the maximum
amount that can be deducted  for  federal  income tax  purposes.
Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to
service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future.
The following table sets forth the plans' funded status and amounts
recognized in the Company consolidated balance sheets based on the
measurement date October 1, 1999 and 1998 in thousands                             January 1,  January 2,

These plans are not administered by the Company and contributions are
determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts.
Information with respect to the Company proportionate share of the
excess, if any, of the actuarially computed value of vested benefits over
these pension plans' net assets is not available. The cost of such plans
amounted to $1,306,433, $1,306,367, and $1,529,000 for the years ended
January 1, 2000, January 2, 1999, and January 3, 1998, respectively.
14  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Concentration of credit risk is limited due to the Company diversified
customer base and the fact that the Company sells commodities. No single
customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company net sales in 1999,
1998 and 1997.
15  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In 1998, the Company made a decision to discontinue the operations of the
Bakery By-Products  Recycling segment in order to concentrate its
financial and human resources on its other businesses. The Bakery
By-Products Recycling segment was comprised of International Processing
Corporation,  International Transportation Services, Inc., and Food
By-Products Recycling collectively referred to as IPC. On February
10, 1999, the Company announced the execution of a Stock Purchase
Agreement dated February 9, 1999,  with Scope Products,  Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Scope Industries, pursuant to which the
Company agreed to sell all the issued and outstanding stock of IPC for a
net consideration of $19,600,000.  The sale was consummated on April 5,
1999.
The disposal of IPC has been accounted for as a discontinued operation
and, accordingly, its net assets have been segregated from continuing
operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, statements of
operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
The condensed statement of operations relating to discontinued operations
for the years ended January 2, 1999 through the measurement date of
November 3, 1998, and January 3, 1998 follows in thousands                          January 2,    January 3,

Included in the loss on disposition of discontinued operations is a net
tax benefit of $22 million. In addition, no interest expense has been
allocated to discontinued operations.
16  CONTINGENCIES
a ENVIRONMENTAL
Chula Vista
The Company has been the owner of an undeveloped property located in Chula
Vista, California the Site. A rendering plant was operated on the Site
until 1982. From 1959 to 1978, a portion of the Site was used as an
industrial waste disposal facility, which was closed pursuant to Closure
Order No. 80-06, issued by the State of California Regional Water Quality
Control Board for the San Diego Region the RWQCB. In June 1982, RWQCB
staff approved a completed closure plan which included construction of a
containment cell the Containment Cell on a portion approximately 5
acres of the Site to isolate contaminated soil excavated from the Site.
The Site has been listed by the State of California as a site for which
expenditures for removal and remedial actions may be made by the State
pursuant to the California Hazardous Substances Account Act, California
Health & Safety Code Section 25300 et seq. Technical consultants retained
by the Company have conducted various investigations of the environmental
conditions at the Site, and in 1996, requested that the RWQCB issue a no
further action letter with respect to the Site. In 1997, the RWQCB issued
Order No. 97-40 prescribing a maintenance and monitoring program for the
Containment Cell. Thereafter, the Company continued to work with the RWQCB
to define the scope of an additional order which would address the
Company future obligations for that remaining portion approximately 30
acres of the Site. On December 30, 1999, the Company completed a sale of
the entire Site pursuant to which the purchaser assumed responsibility for
known environmental liabilities at the Site. Purchaser assumption of
such liability is supported by a Real Estate Pollution Insurance Policy
and a Full Occurrence Commercial General Liability with Pollution Coverage
Insurance Policy. The Company does not currently anticipate future
material involvement at the Site.
Cleveland
In August, 1997, the Company received a Notice of Violation NOV from
the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA for alleged
violations of the Ohio Air Quality Rules as they relate to odor emissions.
The NOV asserted that the Cleveland, OH facility was in violation of the
State nuisance rule based on a City of Cleveland record of complaints
associated with odors emanating from its facility. Since December, 1992,
the Company has been working with the City of Cleveland under a Consent
Agreement to address such complaints and concerns of the neighborhood in
close proximity to the plant. In August, 1998, the Company received a
second NOV from EPA which encompassed the alleged violations from the
first NOV and alleged several violations of terms and conditions found in
the Cleveland plant air permit. Rendering of animal by-products has been
discontinued at the Cleveland plant. The Company and EPA have concluded an
amicable resolution of the NOV in the form of an Administrative Consent
Order without a monetary penalty.
b LITIGATION.
Melvindale
A group of residents living near the Company Melvindale, Michigan plant
has filed suit, purportedly on behalf of a class of persons similarly
situated. The class has been certified for injunctive relief only. The
court declined to certify a damage class. The suit is based on legal
theories of trespass, nuisance and negligence and/or gross negligence, and
is pending in the United States District Court, Eastern District of
Michigan. Plaintiffs allege that emissions to the air, particularly odor,
from the plant have reduced the value and enjoyment of Plaintiffs'
property, and Plaintiffs seek damages, including mental anguish, exemplary
damages and injunctive  relief. In a lawsuit with similar factual
allegations, also pending in United States District Court, Eastern
District of Michigan, the City of Melvindale has filed suit against the
Company based on legal theories of nuisance, trespass, negligence and
violation of Melvindale  nuisance  ordinances  seeking  damages and
declaratory and injunctive relief. The court has dismissed the trespass
counts in both lawsuits without prejudice. The Company or its predecessors
have operated a rendering plant at the Melvindale location since 1927 in a
heavily industrialized area down river south of Detroit. The Company has
taken and is taking all reasonable steps to minimize odor emissions from
its recycling processes and is defending the lawsuit vigorously.
Other Litigation
The Company is also a party to several other lawsuits, claims and loss
contingencies incidental to its business, including assertions by certain
regulatory agencies related to the release of unacceptable odors from some
if its processing facilities.
The Company purchases its workers compensation, auto and general liability
insurance on a retrospective basis. The Company accrues its expected
ultimate costs related to claims occurring during each fiscal year and
carries this accrual as a reserve until such claims are paid by the
Company.
The Company has established loss reserves for insurance, environmental and
litigation matters as a result of the matters discussed above. Although
the ultimate liability cannot be determined with certainty, management of
the Company believes that reserves for contingencies are reasonable and
sufficient based upon present governmental regulations and information
currently available to management. The Company estimates the range of
possible losses related to environmental and litigation matters, based on
certain assumptions, is between $25 million and $85 million at January
1, 2000.  The accrued  expenses and other  noncurrent  liabilities
classifications in the Company consolidated balance sheets include
reserves for insurance, environmental and litigation contingencies of
$171 million and $192 million at January 1, 2000 and January 2, 1999,
respectively. There can be no assurance, however, that final costs will
not exceed current estimates. The Company believes that any additional
liability relative to such lawsuits and claims which may not be covered by
insurance would not likely have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial position, although it could potentially have a material impact
on the results of operations in any one year.
17 BUSINESS SEGMENTS
During Fiscal 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. The Company operated on
a worldwide basis within four industry segments: Rendering, Restaurant
Services, Esteem Products and Bakery By-Products Recycling. Prior to
Fiscal 1998, Rendering and Restaurant Services were not separately
accounted for and therefore separate segment data does not exist for
Fiscal 1997 as it is impractical to create such data. Esteem Products was
newly created in Fiscal 1998; however the Esteem Products segment has
subsequently been combined with the Company Rendering segment and in
Fiscal 2000 will no longer be considered a separate operating segment for
internal management reporting. The measure of segment profit loss
includes all revenues, operating expenses excluding certain amortization
of intangibles, and selling, general and administrative expenses incurred
at all operating locations and exclude general corporate expenses.
Rendering
Rendering consists of the collection and processing of animal by-products
from butcher shops, grocery stores and independent meat and poultry
processors, converting these wastes into similar products such as useable
oils and proteins  utilized by the  agricultural  and oleochemical
industries.
Restaurant Services
Restaurant Services consists of the collection of used cooking oils from
restaurants and recycling them into similar products such as high-energy
animal feed ingredients and industrial oils. Restaurant Services also
provides grease trap servicing. Prior to Fiscal 1998, the activities
conducted by this business segment were considered part of the Rendering
segment.
Esteem Products
Esteem Products consists of the development and marketing of enhanced feed
ingredients from existing raw material streams  utilizing  advanced
biochemistry and animal nutrition technologies. Due to unfavorable market
conditions, beginning in Fiscal 2000 the Esteem Products division will be
combined with the Company Rendering operations.
Bakery By-Products Recycling
Bakery By-Products Recycling consists of the collection and processing of
bakery and confectionery by-products from bakeries, snack food producers,
confectioners, and pasta manufacturers, converting them into a high-energy
ingredient used as a component of livestock and poultry rations. This
business segment has been classified as a discontinued operation and was
sold in 1999 see note 15.
Included in corporate activities are general corporate expenses and the
amortization of intangibles related to Fresh Start Reporting. Assets of
corporate activities include cash, unallocated prepaid expenses, deferred
tax assets, prepaid pension, and miscellaneous other assets.

Certain assets are not attributable to a single operating segment but
instead relate to multiple operating segments operating out of individual
locations. These assets are utilized by both the Rendering and Restaurant
Services business segments and are identified in the category Combined
Rend./Rest. Svcs. Depreciation of Combined Rend./Rest. Svcs. assets is
allocated based upon an estimate of the percentage of corresponding
activity attributed to each segment. Additionally, although intangible
assets are allocated to operating segments, the amortization related to the
adoption of Fresh Start Reporting is not considered in the measure of
operating segment profit loss and is included in Corporate Activities.
