Market Risk
We use a value-at-risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments. Value-at-risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level. We estimate value-at-risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past 250-day period. The high, low and average measured value-at-risk during fiscal 2016 and 2015 related to our derivative financial instruments is as follows

The model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 percent confidence level. We used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths.
Our calculated value-at-risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur. It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year. Value-at-risk during fiscal 2016 was higher than fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher volatility in foreign exchange rates. We believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the derivative financial instrument was intended.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities, other than operating leases, that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.

Item  4. Controls and Procedures.
a Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules13a-15eand 15d-15eunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rulesand forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer CEO and the Chief Financial Officer CFO, with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as ofJune30, 2016 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date, due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.
b Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to ineffective general information technology controls in the areas of user access and program change management over certain information technology systems that are relevant to the Companys financial reporting processes and system of internal control over financial reporting. As a result, our business process automated and manual controls that are dependent on the affected general information technology controls were also ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. However, this material weakness did not result in any identified misstatements to the financial statements or restatement of prior-period financial statements, and there were no changes in previously released financial results.
As a result of the material weakness noted above, we completed additional substantive procedures prior to filing this Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended June30, 2016 Form10-K. Based on these procedures, management believes that our consolidated financial statements included in this Form10-K have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our CEO and CFO have certified that, based on such officers knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this Form10-K, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this Form10-K. In addition, we have developed a remediation plan for this material weakness, which is described below.
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and the description of the material weakness are included on pageF-2 of this Annual Report on Form10-K and is incorporated herein by reference. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm has issued an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2016, which appears on pageF-3 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
c Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
Except for the control deficiencies discussed above that have been assessed as a material weakness as of June30, 2016, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15fand 15d-15fof the Exchange Act that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
d Remediation Plan
Management is actively implementing a remediation plan to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated such that these controls will operate effectively. The remediation actions we are taking, and expect to take, include: iimproving general information technology program change control activities and policies, including processes to maintain sufficient documentation evidencing execution of these policies; iiimproving the control activities and procedures associated with user access to certain information technology systems, including proper segregation of duties related to the affected information systems; iiieducating and re-training control owners regarding internal control processes to mitigate identified risks and maintaining adequate documentation to evidence the effective design and operation of such processes and ivimplementing enhanced controls to monitor the effectiveness of the underlying business process controls that are dependent on the data and financial reports generated from the relevant information systems.
We believe that these actions, and the improvements we expect to achieve as a result, will effectively remediate the material weakness. However, the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting will not be considered remediated until the remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed in fiscal 2017. 50 Table of Contents
