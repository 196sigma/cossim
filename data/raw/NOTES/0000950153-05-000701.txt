33 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders of P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc. the Company
as of January2, 2005 and December28, 2003, and the
related consolidated statements of income, common
stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended January2, 2005. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc. at
January2, 2005 and December28, 2003 and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended January2, 2005, in conformity
with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. As described in Note1, Restatement of Previously
Issued Financial Statements, the Company has restated
previously issued financial statements as of December28,
2003 and for the years ended December28, 2003 and
December29, 2002 and the beginning retained earnings as of
December30, 2001. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of January2, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission and our report dated March25,
2005, expressed an unqualified opinion on managements
assessment and an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting.

Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial
Statements Following a review of the Companys lease accounting, the
Company has adjusted, for purposes of calculating the total
rental obligations, the initial lease terms of operating leases
to include option renewals that are reasonably assured of being
exercised. The Company has also included the rent holidays
related to the period before restaurant opening date to the
lease term based on possession of the premises. Using these
extended terms and in some cases greater rent obligations, the
Company has recorded straight-line rent from the time of
possession through lease term. Straight-line rent recorded from
the date of possession through construction completion has been
capitalized and included in property and equipment. The
capitalized rent is amortized through depreciation and
amortization expense over the useful life of the related asset
or the lease term, whichever is shorter. Straight-line rent
recorded during our preopening period construction completion
through restaurant open date has been recorded to preopening
expense. Once a restaurant opens for business, the Company
records the straight-line rent over the lease term
plus contingent rent to the extent it exceeded
minimum rent per the lease agreement. The Company has
reclassified tenant improvement allowances from a contra asset
in property and equipment, net to long-term lease obligation in
the consolidated balance sheets. The impact of tenant
improvement allowances has also been reclassified from a
reduction of depreciation and amortization expense to a
reduction of occupancy expense or pre-opening expense during
the last few weeks of the rent holiday period in the
consolidated statements of income. Finally, tenant improvement
allowance has been reclassified in the consolidated statements
of cash flows by increasing capital expenditures and increasing
cash provided by operating activities The cumulative effect of the restatement relating to fiscal
years 1993 to 2003 is an increase in the leasehold improvement
asset of $299million, an increase in depreciation expense
of $83million, an increase in the lease obligation
liability of $321million, an increase in preopening
expense of $06million, a decrease in occupancy expense of
$64million and an increase in deferred income tax assets
of $09million. As a result, retained earnings at the end
of 2003 decreased by $14million, net of taxes. Preopening
expense for both years ended December29, 2002 and
December28, 2003 increased by $01million. Occupancy
expense for the years ended December29, 2002 and
December28, 2003 decreased by $13million and
$16million, respectively. Depreciation expense increased
by $19million and $26million for the years ended
December29, 2002 and December28, 2003, respectively.
The restatement decreased reported diluted net income per share
by $002 and $003 for the years ended December29, 2002
and December28, 2003, respectively. The cumulative effect
of the restatement for all years prior to 2002 was
$04million, net of taxes, which was recorded as an
adjustment to opening stockholders equity at
December31, 2001. 39 Table of Contents P.F. CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
Organization and Nature of Operations P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc. the Company
operates two restaurant concepts consisting of restaurants
throughout the United States under the name of P.F.
Changs China Bistro and Pei Wei Asian
Diner. The Company was formed in 1996 and became publicly
traded in 1998.   
Revenue Reclassification The Company has reclassified certain of its restaurants costs
relating to complimentary and employee meals from operating
expenses to contra-revenue accounts. This reclassification has
no effect on net income. The total amount reclassified is
reflected as a reduction of operating expenses and a
corresponding reduction of revenues in the same amount in each
year affected. The reclassification totaled $193million
and $155million in fiscal years 2003 and 2002,
respectively.   
Modification Effective March28, 2004, the Company executed a
modification to all of its partnership agreements that contained
a provision permitting the Company to repurchase the
partners interest at the capital account balance in
certain circumstances. The modification changes the repurchase
portion of the partnership agreements to indicate that fair
value is to be used for all repurchases regardless of
circumstance. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB Interpretation No44
FIN44, Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation and Interpretation of
APB Opinion No25, this results in a modification of
the original arrangement for accounting purposes. As a result of
this modification, all existing unearned compensation is
immediately expensed. This resulted in a first quarter charge of
$125million which consisted of the unamortized portion of
the $115million of unearned compensation existing at
December28, 2003 and the unamortized portion of unearned
compensation generated in the first quarter of 2004 for partners
investing in new stores prior to the modification. This charge
is included in Partner Investment Expense along with the
amortization of previously existing unearned compensation prior
to the date of the modification. In addition, under FIN44 the estimated fair value of each
partnership interest modified will have to be determined at the
date of the modification and the Company has completed this
valuation. To the extent the fair value at the date of
modification is greater than that partners related
minority interest obligation in the consolidated financial
statements, that incremental value could be charged to expense
in a future period if a buy-out occurs prior to the 5-year date
at which the partner would have otherwise earned the right to
have their investment interest purchased at fair value.   
Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to the
end of December and included 52weeks in each of 2002 and
2003 and 53weeks in 2004.   
Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. 41 Table of Contents P.F. CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Principles of Consolidation and Presentation The Companys consolidated financial statements include the
accounts and operations of the Company and its subsidiaries and
partnerships in which it owns more than a 50percent
interest. All material balances and transactions between the
consolidated entities have been eliminated. Minority interest is
recorded as a reduction of the reported income or expense unless
the amount would result in a reduction of expense for which the
minority partner would not be responsible. Certain amounts shown in the prior periods consolidated
financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
current year consolidated financial statements
presentation.   
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Companys cash and cash equivalent balances are not
pledged or restricted. The Companys policy is to invest
cash in excess of operating requirements in income-producing
investments. Income-producing investments with maturities of
three months or less at the time of investment are reflected as
cash equivalents. Amounts receivable from credit card processors
are also considered cash equivalents because they are both
short-term and highly liquid in nature and are typically
converted to cash within three days of the sales transaction.
Cash equivalents at January2, 2005 consist primarily of
money market funds.   
Investments The Companys investments are classified as available for
sale, and have been recorded at fair value which approximates
cost. At both January2, 2005 and December28, 2003 50million was recorded as Short-term investments, which
consisted of preferred stock investments in Dividends Received
Eligible Auction Market Stock DREAMSoffered under
private placements by a subsidiary of Bank of America. Under the
terms of the investment arrangement, the Company participates in
periodic auctions that are generally held every 49days and
that determine the dividend rate. The Company has the
opportunity to offer to sell its investment during such periodic
auctions subject to availability of buying bidders. The Company
may also sell the investment to certain accredited investors.
Under the prospectus it is the intention of the issuer to
maintain a rating for the DREAMS at a grade of Aa3 by
Moodys.   
Receivables Receivables, which the Company classified in Prepaid and
other current assets, consist primarily of amounts due
from landlords or other parties for the reimbursement of
leasehold improvements paid by the Company.   
Inventories Inventories consist of food and beverages and are stated at the
lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method.   
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, which includes
capitalized interest during the construction and development
period. Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful service lives of
the related assets, which approximates seven years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life
of the asset or the length of the related lease term. China and
smallwares are depreciated over two years up to 50percent
of their original cost, and subsequent additions are expensed as
purchased. Depreciation and amortization expense associated with
property and equipment amounted to $154million 214million and $291million, for the years ended
December29, 2002, December28, 2003 and
January2, 2005, respectively. 42 Table of Contents P.F. CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
During the years ended December29, 2002, December28,
2003 and January2, 2005, the Company incurred gross
interest expense of approximately $263,000, $117,000 and
$61,000, respectively. Approximately $106,000 and $58,000,
respectively, of interest costs were capitalized during the
years ended December28, 2003 and January2, 2005.
There were no interest costs capitalized during the year ended
December29, 2002. The Company evaluates impairment losses on long-lived assets
used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and
the undiscounted cash flow estimated to be generated by those
assets is less than the assets carrying amount. The
Companys policy is to evaluate long-lived assets for
impairment at the restaurant level. As of January2, 2005,
no impairment on long-lived assets has been recognized. There
can be no assurance that future impairment tests will not result
in a charge to earnings.   
Goodwill and Intangibles Goodwill represents the residual purchase price after allocation
of the purchase price of assets acquired. Goodwill and
intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not
amortized, but are subject to annual impairment tests.
Intangible assets deemed to have definite lives will continue to
be amortized over their useful lives. Intangible assets, which the Company classified as Other
assets, consist of the excess of the purchase price at the
time the Company repurchases a partners interest over the
imputed fair value of that interest at the time of the original
investment, these assets are amortized over their useful lives.
As of January2, 2005, the intangible asset balance was
$14million, There was no intangible asset balance as of
December28, 2003. Impairment tests are performed with respect to goodwill at the
segment level of reporting. On an annual basis, the Company
reviews the recoverability of goodwill based primarily on a
multiple of earnings analysis comparing the fair value of the
reporting segment to the carrying value. Generally, the Company
performs its annual assessment for impairment during the fourth
quarter of its fiscal year, and will perform the analysis more
frequently under certain circumstances. As of January2,
2005, no impairment of goodwill has been recognized. There can
be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not
result in a charge to earnings.   
Accrued Insurance The Company is self-insured for certain exposures, principally
general liability, workers compensation, medical and
dental for the first $100,000, $250,000 or $500,000 of
individual claims, depending on the type of claim. The Company
has paid amounts to its insurance carrier that are in excess of
the claims known to date and has provided additional accrued
liabilities for its estimate of ultimate claims. In developing
these estimates, the Company uses historical experience factors
to estimate the ultimate claim exposure. In estimating self
insurance reserves, the Company contracted with two third-party
actuaries who utilize estimates of expected losses, based on
statistical analyses of historical industry data as well as the
Companys own estimates based on the Companys actual
historical trends. It is reasonably possible that future
adjustments to these estimates will be required. Based upon the
information known at January2, 2005, management believes
it has provided adequate reserves for its self-insured exposure.   
Lease Obligations The Company leases all of its restaurant properties. At the
inception of the lease, each property is evaluated to determine
whether the lease will be accounted as an operating or capital
lease. The term of the lease used for this evaluation includes
renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise
of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to
exercise such option would result in an economic penalty. 43 Table of Contents P.F. CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
For leases that contain rent escalations, the Company records
the total rent payable during the lease term, as determined
above, on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease
including a rent holiday period beginning upon
possession of the premises, and records the difference between
the minimum rents paid and the straight-line rent as a lease
obligation. Certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental
payments based upon restaurant sales volume contingent
rentals. Contingent rentals are accrued each period as
the liabilities are incurred. It is the Companys policy to capitalize rent expense from
possession date through construction completion. This asset is
included in property and equipment. Capitalized rent is
amortized through depreciation and amortization expense over the
useful life of the related assets. Straight-line rent recorded
during the preopening period construction completion through
restaurant open date has been recorded to preopening expense.
Once a restaurant opens for business, the Company records the
straight-line rent over the lease term plus contingent rent to
the extent it exceeded minimum rent per the lease agreement.   
Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue represents gift cards sold for which revenue
recognition criteria, generally redemption, has not been met.   
Unearned Compensation Prior to the date of modification of the operating agreements
which occurred on March28, 2004, unearned compensation was
calculated as the difference between the imputed fair value of
partners ownership interest at the time the partners
invest in their restaurants and the partners cash
contributions for those ownership interests, recognized over a
five year period. As of the date of modification, the Company
has expensed all remaining unearned compensation. At
December28, 2003 the unamortized deferred compensation
balance was $115million and is presented in the balance
sheet as a reduction to the related minority interest balance.
There was no unearned compensation as of January2, 2005.   
Revenue Recognition Revenues from food, beverage and alcohol sales are recognized as
products are sold.   
Advertising The Company expenses advertising as incurred. Advertising
expense for the years ended December29, 2002,
December28, 2003 and January2, 2005 was
approximately $25million, $28million and
$37million, respectively.   
Partner Bonus Expense, Imputed Partner bonus expense represents the portion of restaurant level
operating results that are allocable to minority partners, but
are presented as bonus expense for accounting purposes. Given
that employees who choose to invest as partners are not eligible
to participate in the restaurant-level bonus program, a portion
of their partnership earnings that would otherwise be presented
as minority interest expense are deemed to be a bonus expense
for financial reporting purposes. The amounts so imputed are
based on the existing programs used by the Company for
non-investing employees based on individual restaurant
level-operating results.   
Preopening Expense Preopening expenses, consisting primarily of manager salaries
and relocation expense, employee payroll and related training
costs incurred prior to the opening of a restaurant, are
expensed as incurred. Also included 44 Table of Contents P.F. CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
in preopening expense is the accrual for straight-line rent
recorded for the period between construction completion and the
restaurant opening date, which generally approximates two weeks.   
Partner Investment Expense Prior to the date of modification of certain operating
agreements which occurred on March28, 2004, partner
investment expense consisted of two components:
iunearned compensation calculated as the difference
between the imputed fair value of partners ownership
interests at the time the partners invest in their restaurants
and the partners cash contributions for those ownership
interests, recognized over a five year period and iithe
excess, if any, of the purchase price at the time the Company
repurchased a partners interest over the imputed fair
value of that interest. Partner investment expense was
$58million and $42million for the years ended
December29, 2002 and December28, 2003, respectively.
Partner investment expense includes amortization of unearned
compensation expense of $24million and $33million
and buy-out expense of $34million and $09million
for the years ended December29, 2002 and December28,
2003, respectively. Partner investment expense for the year ended January2,
2005 was $177million, which included $125million
in unearned compensation expense related to the modification of
partner interests during the first quarter of 2004 along with
$52million in unearned compensation expense related to
stores opened subsequent to the modification.   
Income Taxes The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for
income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are
determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted
tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are
expected to reverse. Recognition of deferred tax assets is
limited to amounts considered by management to be more likely
than not of realization in future periods. Minority interests relating to the income or loss of
consolidated partnerships includes no provision for income taxes
as any tax liability related thereto is the responsibility of
the individual minority investors.   
Stock-Based Compensation The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to
certain employees and directors with an exercise price equal to
or greater than the fair value of the shares at the date of
grant. The Company uses the intrinsic value method to account
for stock option grants and, accordingly, recognizes no
compensation expense for the stock option grants. 45 Table of Contents P.F. CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value
of stock-based compensation plans and other options is amortized
to expense primarily over the vesting period. See Note6
for further discussion of the Companys stock-based
employee compensation and related assumptions used in computing
fair value.   
Net Income Per Share Net income per share is computed in accordance with
SFASNo128, Earnings per Share. Basic net
income per share is computed based on the weighted average of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income
per share is computed based on the weighted average number of
common shares and common stock equivalents, which includes
options outstanding under the Companys stock option plans
and outstanding warrants. For the years ended December29,
2002, December28, 2003 and January2, 2005, there
were 71,000, 179,500 and 115,000, respectively, of the
Companys shares excluded from the calculation due to their
anti-dilutive effect. In addition to the potentially dilutive
shares of the Companys stock addressed above, there is an
additional potentially dilutive effect of unexercised Pei Wei
stock options should the fair value of such stock increase above
the grant price and Pei Wei have a positive net worth and
profitability. 46 Table of Contents P.F. CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, investments,
receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate
fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of
these financial instruments. The fair value of long-term debt is
determined using current applicable rates for similar
instruments and collateral as of the balance sheet date and
approximates the carrying value of such debt.   
Segment Reporting The Company accounts for its segments in accordance with
SFASNo131 SFAS131,
Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information. SFAS131 requires that a public company
report annual and interim financial and descriptive information
about its reportable operating segments. Operating segments, as
defined, are components of an enterprise about which separate
financial information is available that is evaluated regularly
by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to
allocate resources and in assessing performance. Based on the
Companys methods of internal reporting and management
structure, P.F. Changs has two reportable segments, that
of the Bistro and that of Pei Wei.   
Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of
cash investments and receivables. The Company maintains cash and
cash equivalents, funds on deposit and certain other financial
instruments with financial institutions that are considered in
the Companys investment strategy. Concentrations of credit
risk with respect to receivables are limited as the
Companys receivables are primarily with its landlords for
the reimbursement of tenant improvements. 47 Table of Contents P.F. CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Recent Accounting Pronouncements On December16, 2004, the FASB issued
SFASNo123 revised 2004
SFAS123R, Share-Based Payment,
which is a revision of SFAS123. SFAS123R
supersedes APB25, and amends SFASNo95,
Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in
SFAS123R requires all share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in
the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma
disclosure is no longer an alternative. SFAS123R must be
adopted no later than July1, 2005. Early adoption will be
permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet
been issued. The Company expects to adopt SFAS123R on
July1, 2005. As permitted by SFAS123, the Company currently accounts
for share-based payments to employees using the intrinsic value
method and, as such, generally recognize no compensation cost
for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of
SFAS123Rs fair value method will have a
significant impact on the Companys result of operations,
although it will have no impact on the Companys overall
financial position. The impact of adoption of SFAS123R
cannot be predicted at this time, because it will depend on
levels of share-based payments granted in the future as well as
outstanding options not vested as of July1, 2005. However,
had the Company adopted SFAS123R in prior periods, the
impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of
SFAS123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net
income and earnings per share in this Note. SFAS123R
also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of
recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash
flow, rather than as an operation cash flow as required under
current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating
cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in the periods
after adoption. While the Company cannot estimate what those
amounts will be in the future because they depend on, among
other things, when employees exercise stock options, the amount
of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such
excess tax deductions were $70million, $50million
and $117million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Credit Facility In December of 2002, the Company entered into a senior secured
revolving credit facility with a commercial lending institution.
The credit facility allows for borrowings up to $20million
at an interest rate ranging from 125 to 200basis points
over the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR. At
any time, but only one time, the Company has the right to
increase the credit facility up to the maximum aggregate
principal amount of $50million provided the Company is in
compliance with the terms of the facility. The revolving credit
facility expires on December20, 2005 and contains certain
restrictions and conditions which require the Company to:
maintain a certain minimum tangible net worth, an adjusted
leverage ratio at a maximum of 350:1, and a minimum
fixed-charge coverage ratio no less than 125: 1. Shares of the
Companys subsidiary Pei Wei Asian Diner, Inc. serve as
collateral for the credit facility. The Company had no
borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of
January2, 2005, although $56million is committed
for the issuance of a letter of credit which is required by
insurance companies for workers compensation and general
liability insurance claims. Available borrowings under the line
of credit is $144million as of January2, 2005.

Preferred Stock and Common Stockholders Equity   
Preferred Stock The board of directors is authorized to issue up to
10,000,000shares of preferred stock and to determine the
powers, preferences, privileges, rights, including voting
rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions of those
shares without any further vote or act by the common
stockholders. There was no outstanding preferred stock as of
December28, 2003 and January2, 2005.   
Common Stock In January of 2001, the Company raised $408million in
cash through a private equity placement of 125million
shares of common stock with two large mutual fund companies. The
Company used $15million of the proceeds to repay
outstanding borrowings under its credit facility. In April 2002,
the Company amended the Certificate of Incorporation to increase
the number of authorized shares of common stock from
20million to 40million.   
Stock Option Plans In August 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Stock Option Plan
1996 Plan, and in July 1997, the Company adopted
the 1997 Restaurant Management Stock Option Plan 1997
Plan. Options under the 1996 Plan may be granted to
employees, consultants and directors to purchase the
Companys common stock at an exercise price that equals or
exceeds the fair value of such shares on the date such option is
granted. Options under the 1997 Plan may be granted to key
employees of the Company who are actively engaged in the
management and operation of the Companys restaurants to
purchase the Companys common stock at an exercise price
that equals or exceeds the fair value of such shares on the date
such option is granted. Vesting periods are determined at the
discretion of the board of directors, and options currently
outstanding at January2, 2005 vest over five years.
Options may be exercised immediately upon grant, subject to a
right by the Company to repurchase any unvested shares at the
exercise price. Any options granted shall not be exercisable
after ten years. Upon certain changes in control of the Company,
the 1996 and 1997 Plans provide for two additional years of
immediate vesting. The Company has reserved a total of
2,173,000shares of common stock for issuance under the
1996 and 1997 Plans, all of which have been granted as of
January2, 2005. During 1998, the Companys Board of Directors approved the
1998 Stock Option Plan 1998 Plan which provides
for discretionary grants of incentive stock options and
nonqualified stock options to the Companys employees,
including officers, directors, consultants, advisors, and other
independent contractors. A total of 3,213,770 additional shares
of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 1998
Plan. The option price per share for an incentive stock option
may not be less than 100percent of the fair market value
of a share of common stock on the grant date. The option price
per share for a nonstatutory stock option may not be less than
100percent of the fair market value of a share of common
stock on the grant date. The Companys Compensation
Committee has the authority to, among other things: determine
the vesting schedule for each option granted. All options expire
within 10years. The 1998 Plan includes an automatic grant
program for outside directors. Pursuant to this program, each
outside director will be granted an option to
purchase30,000shares of common stock at the time he
or she is first elected or appointed a director of the Company.
In addition, each outside director remaining in office will be
granted an option to purchase15,000 immediately fully
vested shares on the day following each annual meeting of
stockholders. 51 Table of Contents P.F. CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
During 1999, the Companys Board of Directors approved the
1999 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan 1999 Plan,
which provides for discretionary grants of nonqualified stock
options to the Companys employees. The 1999 Plan prohibits
grants to officers or directors. A total of 800,000shares
of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 1999
Plan. The option price per share may not be less than
100percent of the fair market value of a share of common
stock on the grant date. The Companys Compensation
Committee has the authority to, among other things: determine
the vesting schedule for each option granted. All options expire
within 10years. Pro forma information regarding net income and net income per
share, as disclosed in Note2, has been determined as if
the Company had accounted for its employee stock-based
compensation plans and other stock options under the fair value
method of SFAS123. The fair value for these options was
estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use
in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no
vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.
Because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate, in managements
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a

Since options are generally exercisable upon date of grant,
options exercisable, included in the above table, represent
vested options that are not subject to repurchase by the Company. During 2001, Pei Wei Asian Diner, Inc.s Board of Directors
approved the Pei Wei Asian Diner, Inc. 2001 Stock Option Plan
2001 Pei Wei Plan, which provides for
discretionary grants of incentive stock options and nonqualified
stock options to employees, consultants and directors of Pei Wei
Asian Diner, Inc. After factoring in a 1000 for 1 stock split
that occurred in 2003, a total of 169,000shares of common
stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2001 Pei Wei
Plan. As of January2, 2005, 155,000 options have been
granted at prices ranging from $740 to $4677, 45,900 options
have been exercised at $740 and 6,000 options with an exercise
price ranging from $740 to $4677 have been canceled. The
Company holds 960,000shares of common stock of Pei Wei
Asian Diner.   
Key Employee Stock Purchase Plan On December8, 2004 the Companys Board of Directors
approved the Key Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Key
Employee Plan and reserved 50,000shares there
under. Although adopted in 2004, no actual rights to purchase
stock were issued under the Key Employee Plan until 2005. The
Key Employee Plan was adopted to provide a convenient way for
eligible participants, specifically key operators, supervisors,
managers and chefs, to purchase a specified dollar value of
Company stock, which may be required for them to participate in
the Companys Management Incentive Compensation Plan. No
executive officer, including specifically any Named Executive
Officer, is eligible to participate in either the Key Employee
Plan or the corresponding Management Incentive Compensation
Plan. The stock purchase rights are issued at the Companys
current fair market value and the stock is purchased on the open
market. The exercise of any stock purchase right granted under
the Key Employee Plan, and continued ownership of such stock,
may be required as a condition of continued participation in the
Management Incentive Compensation Plan which is a cash
incentive plan designed to focus eligible participants on the
achievement of increased performance and profit objectives.   
Employee Stock Purchase Plan During 1998, the Companys Board of Directors approved the
1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Purchase Plan
and reserved 800,000shares for issuance thereunder. The
Purchase Plan permits eligible 53 Table of Contents P.F. CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
employees to purchase common stock at a discount, but only
through payroll deductions, during concurrent 24month
offering periods. Each offering period will be divided into four
consecutive six-month purchase periods. The price at which stock
is purchased under the Purchase Plan is equal to 85percent
of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the
first day of the offering period and the fair market value of
the common stock on the last day of the offering period.   
9.
Benefit Plan Effective July1, 1997, the Company adopted a 401k
Defined Contribution Benefit Plan the Plan, which
covers substantially all employees of the Company that have
completed one year of service and have attained the age of
21years old. The Plan permits participants to contribute
to the Plan, subject to Internal Revenue Code restrictions, and
the Plan also permits the Company to make discretionary matching
contributions. During the years ended December29, 2002,
December28, 2003 and January2, 2005, the Company did
not make any contributions to the Plan.   
10.
Employment Agreements In August 2002, P.F. Changs executed employment agreements
with its Chief Executive Officer and also its President; and the
President of Pei Wei Asian Diner, Inc., its majority owned
subsidiary. The term for these agreements is three years and the
agreements prohibit these officers from competing with P.F.
Changs China Bistro and Pei Wei Asian Diner in the area of
Chinese and Asian food concepts during the term of the
agreements and for one year after termination. The agreements with the Chief Executive Officer and the
President of the Company provide for immediate vesting of
unvested stock options, and the extension of the expiration date
to three years, after the occurrence of certain events. These
events include a change in control of the Company, termination
of the executives employment by the Company without cause
or separation of employment by the executive for good
reason as defined in the agreements. These provisions in
the employment agreements resulted in a modification under
FIN44 to APB25. Should any of these events occur,
the Company may be required to record an expense based upon the
difference between the original grant price and the fair value
at the modification date for the number of shares ultimately
affected by the modification. As of January2, 2005,
approximately 773,000shares were affected by these
agreements of which approximately 238,000shares were
unvested. The agreement with the President of Pei Wei Asian Diner, Inc.
contains similar provisions with respect to a change in control
for Pei Wei Asian Diner, Inc. and termination without cause but
also includes a provision whereby the Company could be required
to repurchase his shares of common stock in this subsidiary at
fair value should a termination without cause or for good
reason as defined in the agreement occur. The agreement
covers 36,400shares of Pei Wei Asian Diner, Inc. common
stock issued as of January2, 2005, and options to
purchase19,600shares of which 16,800 were unvested
as of January2, 2005. The agreement also covers options to
purchase20,000shares of P.F. Changs China
Bistro stock, of which 17,167 were unvested as of
January2, 2005.   
11.
Partnership Structure P.F. Changs utilizes a partnership structure to facilitate
the development, leadership and operation of its restaurants.
Each partner is required to make a capital contribution in
exchange for their percentage interest in the restaurant or
region the partner is employed to manage. The ownership interest
purchased by each partner generally ranges between two and seven
percent of the restaurant or region the partner oversees. At the
end of a specific term generally five years, P.F. Changs
has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the minority
partners interest in the partners respective
restaurant or region at fair market value. An estimated fair
value is determined by reference to current industry purchase
metrics as well as the average cash flows of 54 Table of Contents P.F. CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
the subject restaurants or regions financial
results. The Company has the option to pay the agreed upon
purchase price in cash or common stock of the Company over a
period of time not to exceed five years. As of January2, 2005, there were 195 partners within the
P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc. system. During 2004, the
Company purchased interests held by 10 minority partners for a
total of approximately $20million. Approximately
$10million of the total purchase price was paid in cash
while the remaining balance has been recorded as amounts due to
related parties on the balance sheet at January2, 2005.
Subsequent to year-end, the Company purchased ten partnership
interests, which became available for purchase prior to 2005,
for a total purchase price of $108million. In 2005, the
Company will have the opportunity to purchase an additional 20
partnership interests.

The FICA tip credit carryforward begins to expire in 2023. For
the year ended January2, 2005 the tip credits were
assessed as probable of utilization prior to their expiration. At January2, 2005, the Company took advantage of
additional tax deductions available relating to the exercise of
non-qualified stock options and disqualifying dispositions of
incentive stock options. Accordingly, for the years ended
December 29. 2002, December28, 2003 and January2,
2005, the Company recorded a $117million 50million and $70million, respectively, increase
to equity with a corresponding reduction to income tax
liability. Quarterly adjustments for the exercise of
non-qualified stock options and disqualifying dispositions of
incentive stock options may vary as they relate to the actions
of the option holder or shareholder. The reserve for tax contingencies related to issues was
$26million at January2, 2005 and $31million
at December28, 2003. This balance is the Companys
best estimate of the potential liability for tax contingencies.
The decline in the tax contingency reserve was primarily due to
the closure of audits and the expiration of the statute of
limitations, partially offset by additions due to changes in tax
laws and current year requirements for asserted and unasserted
items. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax
contingencies due to changes in tax law, both legislated and
concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court
systems.   
13.
Commitments and Contingencies   
Purchase Obligations The Company enters into various purchase obligations in the
ordinary course of its business. Those that are binding relate
primarily to certain commodities contracts and construction for
restaurants planed to open in the near future. At
January2, 2005, such purchase obligations approximated
$717million and were due within the following 12-month
period. 56 Table of Contents P.F. CHANGS CHINA BISTRO, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Litigation The Company is engaged in legal actions arising in the ordinary
course of business and believes that the ultimate outcome of
these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the
results of operations, liquidity or financial position.

The Company has reclassified certain of its restaurant costs
relating to complimentary and employee meals from operating
expenses to contra-revenue accounts as discussed in Note2.
This reclassification has no effect on net income. The total
amount reclassified is reflected as a reduction of operating
expenses and a corresponding reduction of revenues in the same
amount in each quarter affected. The reclassification totaled
$46million, $47million, $48million and
$52million for the first, second, third and fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003 and $57million and
$57million for the first and second quarter of fiscal
2004, respectively.     2
The Company has restated its previously reported consolidated
financial statements for changes in Occupancy, General and
administrative, Preopening and Depreciation expenses for all
previous years presented due to the treatment of lease
accounting as discussed in Note1. The effect of the
restatement on net income loss is a decrease of approximately
$50,000, approximately $77,000, $02million and
$03million for the first, second, third and fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003 and $01million, $01million
and $02million for the first, second and third quarter of
fiscal 2004, respectively. The effect on reported quarterly
basic net income loss per share is a decrease of $001 for
both the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and $001 for
the first quarter of fiscal 2004. There was no effect on our
reported quarterly basic net income loss per share for first
and second quarter of fiscal 2003 and second and third quarter
of fiscal 2004. The effect on reported quarterly diluted net
income loss per share is a decrease of $001 for the first,
third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and $001 for the first
quarter of fiscal 2004, respectively. There was no effect on our
reported quarterly diluted net income loss per share for
second quarter of fiscal 2003 and second and third quarter of
fiscal 2004.     3
Partner investment expense increased during first quarter of

Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the
Companys reports under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to management,
including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and
Chief Financial Officer CFO, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognized that any controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
objectives, as the Companys are designed to do, and
management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures. In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on
Form10-K, as of January2, 2005, an evaluation was
performed under the supervision and with the participation of
our management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rule13a-15e under the Exchange
Act. In performing this evaluation, management reviewed our
lease accounting practices in light of recent guidance from the
SEC on such accounting practices. As a result of this review, we
concluded that our previously established lease accounting
practices were not appropriate and determined that our occupancy
expense, depreciation and amortization expense, property and
equipment, and lease obligations over the last several years had
been misstaked. Accordingly, as described below, we have decided
to restate certain of our previously issued financial statements
to reflect the correction in our lease accounting practices.
Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of
January2, 2005. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule13a-15f under the Exchange Act. Our internal control
system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the
Companys management and Board of Directors regarding the
preparation and fair presentation of published financial
statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well
designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation. Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of January2, 2005. In
making its assessment of internal control over financial
reporting, management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the
Treadway Commission in Internal Control
Integrated Framework. In performing this assessment, management reviewed the
Companys lease accounting practices in light of recent
guidance from the SEC on such accounting practices. As a result
of this review, management concluded that our controls over the
selection and monitoring of appropriate assumptions and factors
affecting lease accounting practices were insufficient, and, as
a result, management has determined that our occupancy expense,
depreciation and amortization expense, property and equipment,
and lease obligations over the last several years had been
misstaked. On March15, 2005, the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors the Committee and management
determined to restate certain of our previously issued financial
statements to reflect the correction in our lease accounting
practices. Management evaluated the impact of this restatement on its
assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and
has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted in the
incorrect lease accounting practices represented a material
weakness. A material weakness in internal control over financial
reporting is a control deficiency within the meaning of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB
Auditing Standard No2, or combination of control
deficiencies, that results in there being 59 Table of Contents more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of
the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected. PCAOB Auditing Standard No2 identifies a
number of circumstances that, because of their likely
significant negative effect on internal control over financial
reporting, are to be regarded as at least significant
deficiencies as well as strong indicators that a material
weakness exists, including the restatement of previously issued
financial statements to reflect the correction of a
misstatement. As a result of this material weakness, management
has concluded that, as of January2, 2005, our internal
control over financial reporting was not effective based on the
criteria set forth by COSO in Internal Control
Integrated Framework. Our independent registered public accounting firm,
Ernst Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on
managements assessment of our internal control over
financial reporting. This report appears below. Remediation Steps to Address Material
Weakness To remediate the material weakness in
our internal control over financial reporting, we have
implemented additional review procedures over the selection and
monitoring of appropriate assumptions and factors affecting
lease accounting practices. Change in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting There were no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during our last
fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. 60 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Board of Directors and Shareholders of P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting, that P.F. Changs China Bistro,
Inc. the Company did not maintain effective
internal control over financial reporting as of January2,
2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the
COSO criteria. The Companys management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The
following material weakness has been identified and included in
managements assessment. As of January2, 2005,
management identified deficiencies in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting regarding the
selection, monitoring, and review of assumptions and factors
affecting lease accounting practices, due to an error in the
Companys interpretation of U.S.generally accepted
accounting principles. As a result of this material weakness in
internal control over financial reporting, the Company
determined its previously reported occupancy expense,
depreciation and amortization expense, property and equipment,
and lease obligations had been misstaked and that previously
issued financial statements should be restated. This material
weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and
extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2004
consolidated financial statements, and this report does not
affect our report dated March25, 2005 on those financial
statements. 61 Table of Contents In our opinion, managements assessment that P.F.
Changs China Bistro, Inc. did not maintain effective
internal control over financial reporting as of January2,
2005 is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the
COSO control criteria. Also, in our opinion, because of the
effect of the material weakness described above on the
achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, P.F.
Changs China Bistro, Inc. has not maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of January2,
2005, based on the COSO control criteria.
