YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009
Note 1 Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
Organization
BPZ Resources,Inc., together with its subsidiaries, collectively referred to as the Company or BPZ unless the context requires otherwise a Texas corporation, is based in Houston, Texas with offices in Lima, Peru and Quito, Ecuador. The Company is focused on the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas in Peru and to a lesser extent Ecuador. The Company also intends to utilize part of its planned future natural gas production as a supply source for the complementary development of a gas-fired power generation facility which is expected to be wholly- or partially-owned by the Company.
The Company maintains a subsidiary, BPZ Exploracin Produccin S.R.L. BPZ EP, registered in Peru through its wholly-owned subsidiary BPZ Energy,LLC, a Texas limited liability company, formerly BPZ Energy,Inc., and its subsidiary BPZ Energy International Holdings, L.P., a British Virgin Islands limited partnership. Currently, the Company, through BPZ EP, has exclusive rights and license contracts for oil and gas exploration and production covering a total of approximately 22 million acres, in four blocks, in northwest Peru. The Companys license contracts cover 100% ownership of the following properties: Block Z-1 06 million acres, Block XIX 05 million acres, Block XXII 09 million acres and Block XXIII 02 million acres. The Block Z-1 contract was signed in November2001, the Block XIX contract was signed in December2003 and Blocks XXII and XXIII contracts were signed in November2007.Generally, according to the Organic Hydrocarbon Law No26221 and the regulations thereunder the Organic Hydrocarbon Law or Hydrocarbon Law the seven-year term for the exploration phase can be extended in each contract by up to an additional three years to a maximum of ten years. However specific provisions of each license contract can vary the exploration phase of the contract as established Hydrocarbon Law. The license contracts require the Company to conduct specified activities in the respective blocks during each exploration period in the exploration phase. If the exploration activities are successful, the Company may decide to enter the exploitation phase and the total contract term can extend up to 30 years for oil exploration and production and up to 40 years for gas exploration and production. In the event a block contains both oil and gas, as is the case in the Companys Block Z-1 contract, the 40-year term may apply to oil exploration and production as well.
Additionally, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, SMC Ecuador Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its registered branch in Ecuador, the Company owns a 10% non-operating net profits interest in an oil and gas producing property, Block 2, located in the southwest region of Ecuador the Santa Elena Property. The license agreement and new operating agreement covering the property extends through May2016.
The Company is in the process of developing its oil and natural gas reserves. The Company was producing and selling oil from the CX-11 platform in the Corvina field of Block Z-1 under a well testing program, until it placed the Corvina field into commercial production in November2010. The Company is currently in the process of fabricating and installing a new platform in the Corvina field to further enhance its production profile. The Company is also in the initial stages of appraising, exploring and developing its potential oil and natural gas reserves from the A platform in the Albacora field of Block Z-1 and began producing from the A-14XD in December2009, and selling oil from the A-14XD well under a well testing program during the second quarter of 2010. The Company completed conducting interference testing in the Albacora field in the third quarter of 2011. The Albacora field is subject to the well testing program until the Company places the field into commercial production. The Company has installed all of the equipment necessary for the reinjection of gas and water at the Albacora platform, completed tie-ins and tested the equipment, and are working on the final environmental permit to allow the Company to commission the equipment to start commercial production in Albacora. In the meantime, the Company has obtained a permit that allows it to flare gas from A-14XD, A-13E and A-9G wells until the permit is obtained. Additionally, the Companys activities in Peru include analysis and evaluation of technical data on its properties, preparation of the development plans for the properties, meeting requirements under the license contracts, fabricating and installing a new platform, procuring equipment for an extended drilling campaign, obtaining all necessary environmental, technical and operating permits, bringing additional production on-line, conducting seismic surveys, obtaining preliminary engineering and design of the power plant and gas processing facilities and securing the required capital and financing to conduct the current plan of operation.
87 BPZ RESOURCES,INC AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BPZ Resources,Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and branch offices. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
The Companys accounting policy regarding partnership or joint venture interests in oil and gas properties is to consolidate such interests on a pro-rata basis in accordance with generally accepted practice in the oil and gas industry. However, the Company has not been able to receive timely information to allow it to proportionately consolidate the minority non-operating net profits interest owned by its consolidated subsidiary, SMC Ecuador Inc. See Note-6, Investment in Ecuador Property to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the Companys investment in its Ecuador property. Accordingly, the Company accounts for this investment under the cost method. As such, the Company records its share of cash received or paid attributable to this investment as other income or expense and amortizes its investment into income over the remaining term of the license agreement which expires in May2016.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP or U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the consolidated financial statements, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Estimates of crude oil reserves are the most significant of the Companys estimates. All of the reserves data in this Form10-K are estimates. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. The accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, reserves estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
Other items subject to estimates and assumptions include the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment, including impairment and asset retirement obligations and deferred income tax assets. Management evaluates estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic and commodity price environment. Current credit market conditions combined with volatile commodity prices have resulted in increased uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined accurately, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
Reclassification
Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2010 and 2009 consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2011 presentation. These reclassifications were not material to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenues when they are realized or realizable and earned. Revenues are considered realized or realizable and earned when ipersuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, iidelivery has occurred or services have been rendered, iiithe sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and ivcollectability is reasonably assured.
The Company sells its production in the Peruvian domestic market on a contract basis. Revenue is recorded net of royalties when the purchaser takes delivery of the oil. At the end of the period, oil that has been produced but not sold is recorded as inventory at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on a weighted average based on production costs. See Note14, Revenue for further information.
Reporting and Functional Currency
The U.S. Dollar is the functional currency for the Companys operations in both Peru and Ecuador. Ecuador has adopted the U.S. Dollar as its official currency. Peru, however, uses its local currency, Nuevo Sol, in addition to the U.S.
88 BPZ RESOURCES,INC AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009
Dollar and therefore its financial results are subject to foreign currency gains and losses. The Company has adopted Accounting Standard Codification ASC Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters, which requires that the translation of the applicable foreign currency into U.S. dollars be performed for balance sheet monetary accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, non-monetary accounts using historical exchange rates in effect at the time the transaction occurs, and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the period reported. Accordingly, the gains or losses resulting from such translation are included in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the relatively low level of activity to-date and the relatively steady exchange rate in Peru, foreign exchange gains and losses for the year ended December31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were not material to the Companys financial statements.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers cash on hand, cash in banks, money market mutual funds and highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Certain of the Companys cash balances are maintained in foreign banks which are not covered by deposit insurance. The cash balance in the Companys U.S. bank accounts may exceed federally insured limits.
Restricted Cash and Performance Bonds
As discussed in Note-7, Restricted Cash and Performance Bonds, the Company has secured various performance bonds, collateralized by certificates of deposit, to guarantee its obligations and commitments in connection with its exploratory properties in Peru. All of the performance bonds have been issued by Peruvian banks and their terms are dictated by the corresponding license contract or agreement. The Companys $750 million secured debt facility and $400 million secured debt facility require it to establish a debt service reserve account while the secured debt facilities are outstanding.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Currently, the Companys contract terms regarding oil sales have a relatively short settlement period. However, the Company regularly reviews all aged accounts receivables for collectability and establishes an allowance as necessary for balances greater than 90 days outstanding. Currently, the majority of all receivables are current or were outstanding less than thirty days.
It is the Companys belief that there are no balances in accounts receivable that will not be collected and that an allowance was not necessary at December31, 2011 and December31, 2010, respectively.
Property, Equipment and Construction in Progress
The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its costs of acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties. Under this method, oil and gas lease acquisition costs and intangible drilling costs associated with exploration efforts that result in the discovery of proved reserves and costs associated with development drilling, whether or not successful, are capitalized when incurred. Capitalized costs of producing crude oil and natural gas properties, along with support equipment and facilities, are amortized to expense by the unit-of-production method based on proved developed crude oil reserves on a field-by-field basis. Certain costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determinations that proved reserves have been found. Exploratory well costs continue to be capitalized if the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the Company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If the determination is dependent upon the results of planned additional wells and required capital expenditures to produce the reserves found, the drilling costs will be capitalized as long as sufficient reserves have been found to justify completion of the exploratory well and additional wells are underway or firmly planned to complete the evaluation of the well. All costs related to unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed when such wells are determined to be non-productive.
The Company assesses its capitalized exploratory wells pending evaluation each quarter to determine whether costs should remain capitalized or should be charged to earnings. Other exploration costs, including geological, geophysical and engineering costs, are expensed as incurred. The Company recognizes gains or losses on the sale of properties, should they occur, on a field-by-field basis.

Projects under construction are not depreciated or amortized until placed in service. For assets the Company constructs, it capitalizes direct costs, such as labor and materials, and indirect costs, such as overhead and interest. As of December31, 2011, property and equipment consists of office equipment, vehicles and leasehold improvements made to the Companys offices. All such values are stated at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets which ranges between three and ten years, or the term of the lease. Vessels and related equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset which is between ten and fifteen years. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Replacements, upgrades or expenditures which improve and extend the life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are sold, retired or otherwise disposed, the applicable costs and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the appropriate accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recorded.
Accrued Liabilities
The accrued liabilities included in the Companys balance sheet at December31, 2011 and 2010 consist mainly of accrued liabilities related to costs for which goods and services have been received in support of the Companys oil and gas operations, including drilling operations, seismic and lease operating costs.
Oil and Gas Accounting Reserves Determination
The successful efforts method of accounting depends on the estimated reserves the Company believes are recoverable from its oil and gas reserves. The process of estimating reserves is complex. It requires significant judgments and decisions based on available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data.
To estimate the economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and related future net cash flows, the Company incorporates many factors and assumptions including expected reservoir characteristics based on geological, geophysical and engineering assessments;
future production rates based on historical performance and expected future operating and investment activities;
future oil and gas quality differentials;
assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies; and
future development and operating costs.
The Company believes its assumptions are reasonable based on the information available to it at the time it prepared the estimates. However, these estimates may change substantially going forward as additional data from development activities and production performance becomes available and as economic conditions impacting oil and gas prices and costs change.
Management is responsible for estimating the quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and for preparing related disclosures. Estimates and related disclosures are prepared in accordance with the Security and Exchange Commission SEC requirements and generally accepted industry practices in the US as prescribed by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Reserve estimates are independently evaluated at least annually by independent qualified reserves engineers, Netherland, Sewell Associates,Inc NSAI. The estimate of the Companys proved reserves as of December31, 2011 and 2010 have been prepared and presented in accordance with new SEC rulesand accounting standards. These new ruleswere effective for fiscal years ending on or after December31, 2009, and require SEC reporting companies to prepare their reserve estimates using revised reserve definitions and revised pricing based on 12-month un-weighted first-day-of-the-month average pricing. The previous rulesrequired that reserve estimates be calculated using last-day-of-the-year pricing.
The Companys Board of Directors oversees the review of its oil and gas reserves and related disclosures by the Companys appointed independent reserve engineers. The Board meets with management periodically to review the reserves process, results, and to confirm that the independent reserve engineers have had access to sufficient information, including the nature and satisfactory resolution of any material differences of opinion between the Company and the reserve engineers.

Reserves estimates are critical to many of the Companys accounting estimates, including Determining whether or not an exploratory well has found economically producible reserves;
Calculating the Companys unit-of-production depletion rates. Proved reserves estimates are used to determine rates that are applied to each unit-of-production in calculating its depletion expense; and
Assessing, when necessary, the Companys oil and gas assets for impairment using undiscounted future cash flows based on managements estimates. If impairment is indicated, discounted values will be used to determine the fair value of the assets. The critical estimates used to assess impairment, including the impact of changes in reserves estimates, are discussed below.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its long-lived assets by monitoring and evaluating changes in circumstances that may indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Examples of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of an asset should be assessed include but are not limited to the following: a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a significant physical change in an asset, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset, and/or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with an asset used for the purpose of producing revenue.
The Company considers historical performance and anticipated future results in its evaluation of potential impairment. Accordingly, when indicators of impairment are present, the Company evaluates the carrying value of these assets in relation to the operating performance of the business and future discounted and non-discounted cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets. Impairment losses are recognized when the expected future cash flows from an asset are less than its carrying value. For the year ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no impairment losses recognized by the Company.
Stock Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation at fair value in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation ASC Topic 718, which establishes accounting for stock-based payment transactions for employee services and goods and services received from non-employee directors. Under the provisions of ASC Topic 718, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the date of grant, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations ratably over the employees or non-employee directors requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant. The fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Restricted stock awards and units are valued using the market price of the Companys common stock on the grant date. Additionally, stock-based compensation cost is recognized based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest, therefore, the compensation cost recognized on stock-based payment transactions is reduced for estimated forfeitures based on the Companys historical forfeiture rates. Additionally, no stock-based compensation costs were capitalized for the year ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. The Company provides compensation benefits to employees and non-employee directors under stock-based payment arrangements, including various employee stock option plans. See Note-11, Stockholders Equity for further discussion of the Companys stock-based compensation plans.
ASC Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, requires the cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for equity awards excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows. However, as the Company is not able to use these tax deductions see Note-17, Income Taxes for further information, it has no excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows.
Capitalized Interest
Certain interest costs have been capitalized as part of the cost of oil and gas properties under development, including wells in progress and related facilities. Total interest costs capitalized during the year ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $107 million, $96 million and $44 million, respectively.
91 BPZ RESOURCES,INC AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Companys financial instruments consist of cash, restricted cash, trade receivables, trade payables, debt and derivatives. The book values of cash, trade receivables and trade payables are considered to be representative of their respective fair values due to the short-term maturity of those instruments. For further information regarding the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt see Note-12, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. For the Companys variable rate debt at December31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying value of the debt approximates fair value as the interest rates are based on floating rates identified by reference to market rates and because the interest rates charged are at rates at which the Company can currently borrow. The Companys derivative financial instruments consist of variable financing arranger fee payments that are dependent on the change in oil prices from the loan origination date of the Companys variable rate debt and the oil price on each repayment date. The Company estimates the fair value of these payments based on published forward commodity price curves at each financial reporting date.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Under ASC Topic 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
Environmental
The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations of various U.S. and international jurisdictions. These laws and regulations, which are subject to change, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require the Company to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites.
Environmental costs that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Costs are expensed when they relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and will not contribute to current or future revenue generation. Liabilities related to environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are accrued when property or services are provided and when such costs can be reasonably estimated. The Companys cost for environmental impact assessments related to the Companys properties for the year ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $16 million, $24 million and $12 million, respectively.
Loss per Common Share
In accordance with provisions of ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share, basic earnings loss per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the periods. Diluted earnings per share is computed based upon the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the assumed issuance of common shares for all potentially dilutive securities. Diluted loss per share equals basic loss per share for the periods presented because the effects of potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued additional guidance regarding fair value measurement and disclosure requirements.The most significant change will require the Company, for Level 3 fair value measurements, to disclose quantitative information about unobservable inputs used, a description of the valuation processes used, and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements.The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December15, 2011.The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company.
In June2011, the FASB issued guidance impacting the presentation of comprehensive income.The guidance eliminates the current option to report components of other comprehensive incomein the statement of changes in equity.The guidance is intended to provide a more consistent method of presenting non-owner transactions that affect an entitys

Note 2 Value-Added Tax Receivable
Value-added tax referred to as IGV in Peru is generally imposed on goods and services at a rate of 18% effective March2011 and 19% in previous periods.
Peru currently has an IGV early recovery program for oil and gas companies during the exploration phase. Under this program,IGV paid on the acquisition of certain goods and services used directly in hydrocarbon exploration activities can be recovered prior to a commercial discovery taking place or the initiation of production and revenue billings. Because the Company has oil sales in the Corvina field in commercial production and Albacora field under a well testing program, it is no longer eligible for the IGV early recovery program. Accordingly, the Company is recovering its IGV receivable with IGV payables associated with future oil sales under the normal IGV recovery process.

All of the performance and insurance bonds are issued by Peruvian banks and their terms are governed by the corresponding license contracts, customs laws, legal requirements or rental practices.
Note 8 Asset Retirement Obligation
An obligation was recorded for the future plug and abandonment of the oil wells in the Corvina and Albacora fields, and Pampa la Gallina well in Block XIX, for further information see Note-5, Property, Equipment and Construction in Progress, in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations. ASC 410-20, requires that an asset retirement obligation ARO associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset be recognized as a liability in the period in which it is incurred and becomes determinable. Under this method, when liabilities for dismantlement and abandonment costs, excluding salvage values, are initially recorded, the carrying amount of the related oil and natural gas properties is increased. The fair value of the ARO asset and liability is measured using expected future cash outflows discounted at the Companys credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Accretion of the liability is recognized each period using the interest method of allocation, and the capitalized cost is depleted using the units of production method. Should either the estimated life or the estimated abandonment costs of a property change materially upon the Companys periodic review, a new calculation is performed using the same methodology of taking the abandonment cost and inflating it forward to its abandonment date and then discounting it back to the present using the Companys credit-adjusted-risk-free rate. The carrying value of the asset retirement obligation is adjusted to the newly calculated value, with a corresponding offsetting adjustment to the asset retirement cost.
Activity related to the Companys ARO for the year ended December31, 2011 and December31, 2010 is as follows

The 2011 and 2010 revisions in estimates are due to the shift in timing of cash flows associated with expected payment of the ARO liability. As the expected timing to settle the liabilities was extended both in 2011 and 2010, the present value of the liabilities was decreased and, as a result, the Company reduced both the liability and capitalized asset by approximately $03 million and $03 million, respectively, in accordance with ASC Topic 410.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009
On or after February3, 2013, the Company may redeem for cash all or a portion of the 2015 Convertible Notes at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, plus a make-whole payment if: 1for at least 20 trading days in any consecutive 30 trading days ending within 5 trading days immediately before the date the Company mails the redemption notice, the last reported sale price of its common stock exceeded 175% of the conversion price in effect on that trading day, and 2there is no continuing default with respect to the notes that has not been cured or waived on or before the redemption date.
If the Company experiences any one of the certain specified types of corporate transactions, holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their 2015 Convertible Notes. Any repurchase of the notes pursuant to these provisions will be for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the purchase date.
The indenture agreement contains customary terms and covenants and events of default, the occurrence and continuation of which could result in the acceleration of amounts due under the 2015 Convertible Notes.
Net proceeds from the sale of the 2015 Convertible Notes, after deducting the discounts and commissions and any offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately $1649 million. The initial purchaser received commissions of approximately $55 million in connection with the sale and the Company incurred approximately $06 million of direct expenses in connection with the offering. The Company used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital, reduction or refinancing of debt, and other corporate obligations.
The Company accounts for the 2015 Convertible Notes in accordance with ASC Topic 470, Debt, as it pertains to accounting for convertible debt instruments that maybe settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement. Under the accounting guidance, convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion are required to be separated into liability and equity components, with the liability component amount determined in a manner that reflects the issuers non-convertible debt borrowing rate. The value assigned to the liability component is determined by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an equity conversion feature. The value assigned to the equity component is determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the initial proceeds. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount the non-cash discount is amortized to interest cost using the effective interest method over the term of the debt agreement. In addition, transaction costs incurred that directly relate to the issuance of convertible debt instruments must be allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation of proceeds and accounted for as debt issuance costs and equity issuance costs, respectively.
The Company estimated its non-convertible borrowing rate at the date of issuance of the 2015 Convertible Notes to be 12%. The 12% non-convertible borrowing rate represented the borrowing rate of similar companies with the same credit quality as the Company and was obtained through a quote from the initial purchaser. Using the income method and discounting the principal and interest payments of the 2015 Convertible Notes using the 12% non-convertible borrowing rate, the Company estimated the fair value of the $1709 million 2015 Convertible Notes to be approximately $1363 million with the discount being approximately $346 million. The discount is being amortized as non-cash interest expense over the life of the notes using the effective interest method. In addition, the Company allocated approximately $48 million of the $61 million of fees and commissions as debt issue costs that are being amortized as non-cash interest expense over the life of the notes using the effective interest method. The remaining $13 million of fees and commissions were treated as transaction costs associated with the equity component. The Company estimates the remaining cash payments including interest payments related to the 2015 Convertible Notes, assuming no conversion, for 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 to be approximately $111 million, $111 million, $111 million and $1765 million, respectively. The Company evaluated the 2015 Convertible Notes agreement for potential embedded derivatives, noting that the conversion feature and make-whole provisions did not meet the embedded derivative criteria as set forth in ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Therefore, no additional amounts have been recorded for those items.
As of December31, 2011, the net amount of $1468 million includes the $1709 million of principal reduced by $241 million of the remaining unamortized discount. The net amount of the equity component is $333 million, which includes the initial discount of $346 million, reduced by $13 million of direct transaction costs. The remaining unamortized discount of $241 million will be amortized into interest expense, using the effective interest method, over the remaining life of the loan agreement, whose term expires in March2015. At December31, 2011, using the conversion rate of 1690082 
103 BPZ RESOURCES,INC AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009
shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 2015 Convertible Notes, if the $1709 million of principal were converted into shares of common stock, the notes would convert into approximately 289 million shares of common stock. As of December31, 2011, there is no excess if-converted value to the holders of the 2015 Convertible Notes as the price of the Companys common stock at December31, 2011, $284 per share, is less than the conversion price.
For the year ended December31, 2011 and December31, 2010, the annual effective interest rate on the 2015 Convertible Notes, including the amortization of debt issue costs, was approximately 126%.
For the year ended December31, 2011 and December31, 2010, respectively, the amount of interest expense related to the 2015 Convertible Notes was $180 million and $153 million, respectively, disregarding capitalized interest considerations, and includes $111 million and $101 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the contractual interest coupon, $60 million and $45 million, respectively, of non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the discount and $09 million and $07 million, respectively of interest expense related to the amortization of debt issue costs. 150 Million IFC Reserve-Based Credit Facility
The Company had a $150 million reserve-based lending facility IFC Facility agreement the Loan Agreement with IFC through its subsidiaries BPZ EP and BPZ Marine Peru S.R.L. as borrowers.The IFC Facility had $125 million outstanding maturing in December2012; however, following the $400 million secured debt facility issued by the Company in January2011, a portion of the proceeds was used to repay the amount outstanding to IFC. Because the Company refinanced the obligation on a long-term basis, $50 million of the $125 million that was originally expected to be paid within a year as of December31, 2010 is being classified as a long-term liability, in accordance with ASC Topic 470, Debt, as the Company refinanced the obligation on a long-term basis.
The IFC Facility had interest at an approximate rate of LIBOR plus 275%, equivalent to 321% based on the six-month LIBOR rate of 046% at December31, 2010. The maximum amount available under this facility began at $150 million and was to be reduced by $25 million beginning on December16, 2010 and every six months thereafter during the term of the Loan Agreement. The amount available under the IFC Facility was subject to a semi-annual borrowing base determination based on the value of oil reserves. In addition, the Company was subject to various financial covenants calculated as of the last day of each quarter, including a life of field coverage ratio, life of loan coverage ratio, debt to equity ratio and interest coverage ratio. The Loan Agreement also provided for events of default, cure periods and lender remedies customary for agreements of this type. The Company was in compliance with all material covenants of the Loan Agreement as of December31, 2010.
Other
In July2009, the Company, through its subsidiary, BPZ EP, entered into a $51 million short-term loan agreement to finance the purchase of casing and accessories for use in its current and future operations. The $51 million short-term loan bore an annual interest rate of 545% and was repaid in five monthly installments of approximately $10 million starting September2009. In connection with the $51 million short-term loan agreement, the Company was required to deposit $10 million with the lending institution as a guaranty for the loan. The $10 million was applied to the last installment of the loan repayments. As of December31, 2009, the remaining principal amount was approximately $10 million and, along with the accrued interest due, was repaid with the $10 million deposit and cash in January2010.
Note Payable

The Note originally provided for maturity in July2009 and bore an annual interest rate of 120%. However, in March2009 the Company repaid the principal amount and accrued interest in full to the Note Holder.

In June2007, the Company entered into a capital lease agreement, with an option to purchase two vessels, the Namoku and the Nuuanu, to assist in the development of the Corvina oil. The capital lease assets were recorded at $62 million, which represented the present value of the minimum lease payments, or the aggregate fair market value of the assets.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009
In May2009, the Company entered into an amendment of its lease agreement for two vessels under charter, the Namoku and the Nuuanu. Under the terms of the amended lease agreement, the charter, originally set to expire in November2009, was extended for five years commencing on May1, 2009. During the first 18 months of the amended lease term, the daily charter rate for the use of both vessels is fixed.Commencing in November2010, the daily charter rate for the use of both vessels will be based on a tiered structure with the daily rate dependent upon the amount of the previous months average daily per barrel price of West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil WTI, as indicated on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Any amount paid by the Company after November2010 over the initial daily rate as a result of the escalated tiered structure based on the price of WTI will be considered contingent rental payments. The amount of the contingent lease payments paid in 2011 was $16 million. The amended lease agreement contains a $30 million purchase option after the third year of the lease, a $20 million purchase option after the fourth year of the lease and a mandatory $10 million purchase obligation by the Company after the fifth year of the lease. The Company accounted for the amended lease agreement in accordance with ASC Topic 840, Leases.

Further, the Company capitalized an additional $28 million of production equipment in order to have the Companys floating production, storage and offloading facility FPSO ready to receive and treat oil received from the CX-11 platform. The FPSO lease contains two bargain purchase options; therefore, depreciation of the leased asset was over its useful life. The lease contains a bargain purchase option of $10 million at the end of the first year of the lease and a $05 million bargain purchase option at the end of the second year of the lease. The Company accounted for the lease agreement in accordance with ASC Topic 840, Leases. Under the guidance, the lease agreement is accounted for as a capital lease and the imputed interest rate necessary to reduce the net minimum lease payments to present value over the lease term is 283%.

In March2008, the Company entered into a lease-purchase agreement to acquire the BPZ-02 vessel resulting in additional capital assets of approximately $70 million. In February2009, the Company made the final lease payment on the BPZ-02 deck vessel at which point title to the vessel was transferred to it.
In 2007, the Company entered into two capital loans for the purchase of office furniture. Both loans have a term of 60 months, bearing interest at 594% and 944%, respectively, with principal and interest payments due on a monthly basis. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company made the final payments on the lease agreements and title of the office furniture was transferred to it.
In November2009, the Company entered into a capital lease agreement for a construction vessel, the Don Fernando, resulting in additional capital assets of approximately $70 million. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company made the final lease payment on the Don Fernando construction vessel, at which point title of the vessel was transferred to it.

Note 10 Derivative Financial Instruments
Objective and Strategies for Using Derivative Instruments In connection with the $400 million secured debt facility and the $750 million secured debt facility in 2011, the Company and Credit Suisse agreed that a portion of the arranger fee would be based on the performance for oil prices and be payable at each of the principal repayment dates. The fee is calculated by multiplying the principal payment amount by the change in oil prices from the loan origination date and the oil price at each principal repayment date. Additionally, the fee is capped at 18% of the $400 million secured debt facility and 12% of the $750 million secured debt facility. The Performance Based Arranger Fee is being accounted for as an embedded financing derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging andaccordingly, is being recorded at fair value with any mark-to-market changes in value reflected as loss on derivatives in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plans
The Company has in effect the 2007 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended in 2010 to increase the number of shares available the 2007 LTIP, and the 2007 Directors Compensation Incentive Plan the Directors Plan. The 2007 LTIP and Directors Plan provides for awards of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, other stock-based awards and cash-based awards to any of the Companys officers, employees, consultants and the employees of certain of the Companys affiliates as well as non-employee directors. The number of shares authorized under the amended 2007 LTIP and Directors Plan is 80million and 25 million, respectively. As of December31, 2011, approximately 35 million shares remain available for future grants under the 2007 LTIP and 08 million shares remain available for future grants under the Directors Plan.
Restricted Stock Awards and Performance Shares
At December31, 2011, there were approximately 425,364 shares of restricted stock awards outstanding to officers, directors and employees all of which generally vest with the passage of time on the second or third anniversary of the date of grant. Restricted stock is subject to certain restrictions on ownership and transferability when granted. The fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the market price of the Common Stock on the date of grant. Compensation cost for such awards is recognized ratably over the vesting or service period, net of forfeitures; however, compensation cost related to performance shares will not be recorded or will be reversed if the Company does not believe it is probable that such performance criteria will be met or if the service provider employee or otherwise fails to meet such criteria.

The weighted average grant-date fair value of restricted stock awards granted for the year ended December31, 2010 and 2009 was $528 and $533, respectively. The fair value of restricted stock awards that vested during the year ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $08million, $49million, and $16million, respectively. As of December31, 2011, there was $09 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 11years.
Stock Options
Incentive and non-qualified stock options issued to directors, officers, employees and consultants are typically granted at the fair market value on the date of grant. The Companys stock options generally vest in equal annual installments over a two to three year period and expire ten years from the date of grant.
The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable and negotiable in a free trading market. This model does not consider the employment, transfer or vesting restrictions that are inherent in the Companys stock options.
Use of an option valuation model includes highly subjective assumptions based on long-term predictions, including the expected stock price volatility and expected option term of each stock option grant.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The employee stock purchase plan, which was approved by the shareholders on June24, 2011, provides eligible employees the opportunity to acquire shares of BPZ Resources,Inc. common stock at a discount, through payroll deductions. Employees will be allowed to purchase up to 2,500 shares in any one offering period not longer than twenty-seven months, within IRS limitations and plan rules. The offering period means each period of time which common stock is offered to participants. Generally, the purchase price for stock acquired under the plan is the lower of 85% subject to compensation committee adjustment of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date or the fair market value of the common stock on the investment date. Under this plan, 2,000,000 common shares have been reserved for issuance and purchase by eligible employees. Activity under this plan began in the first quarter of 2012.
Note 12 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
The Company records certain of its assets and liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price. A three-level valuation hierarchy has been established to allow readers to understand the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows   
Level 1    
Fair value measurements which use quoted market  prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.      
Level 2   
Fair value measurements which use inputs, other than  quoted prices included within Level 1, which are observable for the asset or  liability, either directly or indirectly.      
Level 3    
Fair value measurements which use unobservable  inputs.     
The following describes the valuation methodologies the Company uses for its fair value measurements.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and any highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90days or less. The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
111 BPZ RESOURCES,INC AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash includes all cash balances which are associated with the Companys long-term assets, short-term debt and long-term debt. The carrying amount approximates fair value because the nature of the restricted cash balance is the same as cash. The fair value of restricted cash is measured using Level 1 inputs within the three-level valuation hierarchy.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Companys derivative financial instruments consist of variable financing arranger fee payments that are dependent on the change in oil prices from the loan origination date of the Companys $400 million secured debt facility, the $750 million secured debt facility and the oil price on each repayment date. The Company estimates the fair value of these payments based on published forward commodity price curves at each financial reporting date. The discount rate used to discount the associated cash flows is based on the Companys credit-adjusted risk-free rate. For further information regarding the Companys derivatives, see Note-10, Derivative Financial Instruments.

Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities
The Company discloses or recognizes its non-financial assets and liabilities, such as asset retirement obligations and impairments of long-lived assets, at fair value on a non-recurring basis. See Note-8, Asset Retirement Obligation for further information. As none of the Companys non-financial assets and liabilities were impaired as of December31, 2011 and December31, 2010, and no other fair value measurements were required to be recognized on a non-recurring basis, additional disclosures were not provided. However, the Company did write off certain assets related to its gas-to-power project and certain platforms during the year ended December31, 2010. For further information on these write offs, see Note-15, Other Expense.
Additional Fair Value Disclosures
Debt with Variable Interest Rates
The fair value of the Companys $750 million secured debt facility and $400 million secured debt facility, at December31, 2011, and the Companys IFC Facility, at December31, 2010, approximates the carrying value because the interest rates are based on floating rates identified by reference to market rates, and because the interest rates charged are at rates at which the Company could borrow under similar terms.

For the year ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company had not entered into any transactions with affiliates or related parties.
Note 14 Revenue
At December31, 2011, the Company had developed nine wells in the Corvina field and four wells in the Albacora field. Of these wells, five wells were producing oil, six wells were producing oil intermittently, one well was being used for gas injection and the remaining well was being used for water reinjection. At December31, 2010, the Company was producing oil from seven wells with the remaining wells being shut-in. At December31, 2009, the Company was producing oil from five wells in the Corvina field and one well in the Albacora field under a well testing program.
The Company began producing oil on a limited basis in November2007 from the CX11-21XD and CX11-14D wells in the Corvina field under a well testing program. During the second and fourth quarter of 2008, it added production from the CX11-18XD and CX11-20XD wells, respectively, under the well testing program. In 2009, the Company added the CX-15D during the second quarter and the CX11-19D well in the Corvina field and the A-14XD well in the Albacora field during the fourth quarter to its well testing program. In 2010, the Company added the CX11-17D well during the first quarter, the CX11-22D well during the third quarter and the CX11-23D well during the fourth quarter to its well testing program. On November30, 2010, the Company transitioned the Corvina field from extended well testing into commercial production. In the third quarter of 2011, the Company added the A-13E and A-9G wells in the Albacora field to production. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company added the A-12F in the Albacora to production.
The oil is delivered by vessel to the refinery owned by the Peruvian national oil company, Petroleos del Peru - PETROPERU S.A. Petroperu, in Talara, locatedapproximately 70 miles south of the platform. Produced oil is kept in production inventory until the Company increases the inventory quantities to a sufficient level that the refinery in Talara will accept delivery. Although all of the Companys oil sales are to Petroperu, it believes that the loss of Petroperu as its sole customer would not materially impact the Companys business because it could readily find other purchasers for the Companys oil production both in Peru and internationally.
In January2009, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary BPZ EP, entered into a long-term oil supply agreement with Petroperu. Under the terms of the contract, the Company agreed to sell, and Petroperu agrees to purchase the Companys crude oil production originating from the Corvina oilfield in Block Z-1. The contract term is for approximately seven years or until 17 MMBbls of crude oil has been delivered to the Petroperu refinery located in Talara, whichever comes

first. The price per barrel of oil under the agreement is determined using a basket of crude oils based on a 15-day average of Forties, Oman, and Suez blend crude oil prices, as quoted in the Spot Crude Prices Assessment published in Platts Crude Oilgram Price Report, minus $1 per barrel and other customary purchase price adjustments. The Company has approximately 136 MMBbls remaining under the contract.
In May2010, through its wholly-owned subsidiary BPZ EP, the Company entered into a short-term 400 MBbls oil supply agreement with Petroperu. Under the terms of the contract, the Company agreed to sell, and Petroperu agrees to purchase the Companys crude oil production originating from the Albacora oilfield in Block Z-1. The price per barrel of oil under the agreement is determined using a basket of crude oils based on a 15-day average of Forties, Oman, and Suez blend crude oil prices, as quoted in the Spot Crude Prices Assessment published in Platts Crude Oilgram Price Report, minus $3 per barrel and other customary purchase price adjustments. As part of the price adjustments the Company is allowed to sell oil under the contract as long as the salt content is less than 25 pounds per thousand barrels of oil. There is no purchase price adjustment associated with the oil sales if the salt content is less than 10 pounds per thousand barrels. The Company has approximately 83 MBbls remaining under the contract.
In July2010, through its wholly-owned subsidiary BPZ EP, the Company entered into a second short-term 110 MBbls oil supply agreement with Petroperu. Under the terms of the contract, the Company agreed to sell, and Petroperu agrees to purchase the Companys crude oil production originating from the Albacora oilfield in Block Z-1. The price per barrel of oil under the agreement is determined using a basket of crude oils based on a 15-day average of Forties, Oman, and Suez blend crude oil prices, as quoted in the Spot Crude Prices Assessment published in Platts Crude Oilgram Price Report, minus $430 per barrel and other customary purchase price adjustments. As part of the purchase price adjustments, the Company is allowed to sell oil under the contract as long as the salt content is less than 60 pounds per thousand barrels of oil. There is an incremental purchase price adjustment associated with the oil sales if the salt content is between 25 pounds and 60 pounds per thousand barrels. All 110 MBbls under this supply agreement were delivered and sold to Petroperu during the month of July2010.
In September2010, through its wholly-owned subsidiary BPZ EP, the Company entered into a third short-term 80 MBbls oil supply agreement with Petroperu. Under the terms of the contract, the Company agreed to sell, and Petroperu agrees to purchase the Companys crude oil production originating from the Albacora oilfield in Block Z-1. The price per barrel of oil under the agreement is determined using a basket of crude oils based on a 15-day average of Forties, Oman, and Suez blend crude oil prices, as quoted in the Spot Crude Prices Assessment published in Platts Crude Oilgram Price Report, minus $430 per barrel and other customary purchase price adjustments. As part of the purchase price adjustments, the Company is allowed to sell oil under the contract as long as the salt content is less than 60 pounds per thousand barrels of oil. There is an incremental purchase price adjustment associated with the oil sales if the salt content is between 25 pounds and 60 pounds per thousand barrels. Approximately 50 MBbls under this supply agreement were delivered and sold to Petroperu during the month of September2010 and the remaining 30 MBbls was delivered during October2010.
The Companys revenues are reported net of royalties owed to the government of Peru. Royalties are assessed by Perupetro, as stipulated in the Block Z-1 license agreement based on production. However, their calculation is based on the past five-day average basket of crude oils prices, as discussed above, before the crude oil delivery date, as opposed to the price the Company receives for oil which is based on the prior two-week average of a blend of crude oil prices before the crude oil delivery date. For the year ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the revenues received by the Company are net of royalty costs of approximately 5% of gross revenues or $75 million, $63 million and $29 million, respectively.
Note 15 Other Expense
For the year ended December31, 2010, the Company is reporting $129million of charges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as Other expense. These charges include $107million of charges related to certain engineering, consulting, environmental and legal costs for the Companys planned gas plant, pipeline and gas-to-power project and $22 million of charges related to the abandonment of two platforms. With respect to the $107 million of charges related to the planned gas plant, pipeline and gas-to-power project, during the third quarter of 2010, management determined that there is no future benefit of these engineering and development costs associated with the Companys current gas plant, pipeline and gas-to-power project plans. Accordingly, the Company wrote off these costs. With respect to the $22 million of platform abandonment costs, the Company has determined that two previously built platforms, one located in the Piedra Redonda field and the CX-13 platform located in the eastern part of the Corvina field, both of which were in existence when the Company
114 BPZ RESOURCES,INC AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009
acquired the rights to the offshore Block Z-1 in northwest Peru, are not suitable for the Companys future oil development plans. Accordingly, the Company wrote off the $14 million of costs incurred to evaluate the feasibility of refurbishing and using these platforms. In addition, the Company is accruing $08 million of abandonment costs related to the platform in the Piedra Redonda field as it is obligated to ensure the platform does not cause a threat to marine vessels operating in the area or marine wildlife. There were no similar expenses incurred by the Company in 2011 or 2009.
Note 16 Standby Costs
After completing the CX11-23D well in the Corvina field and the A-17D well in the Albacora field at the end of the third quarter of 2010, the Company suspended drilling operations until it completes a seismic data acquisition program planned for 2012 and fabricates and installs a new drilling platform in Block Z-1, currently scheduled for the third quarter of 2012.
As a result, for the year ended December31, 2011, the Company incurred $45 million in standby costs that includes $39 million of standby rig costs. Additionally, the Company incurred $06 million of allocated expenses associated with drilling operations for the year ended December31, 2011.
For the year ended December31, 2010, the Company incurred $75 million in standby costs that includes $49 million of standby rig costs. Additionally, the Company incurred $26 million of allocated expenses associated with drilling operations for the year ended December31, 2010. There were no similar expenses incurred by the Company in 2009.

At December31, 2011, the Company has recognized a gross deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards of $395 million before application of the valuation allowances. Net deferred tax assets in the foregoing table include the deferred consequences of the future reversal of Peruvian deferred tax assets and liabilities on the impact of the Peruvian employee profit share plan tax of $39 million in 2011 and $43 million in 2010.
At December31, 2011, the Company had recognized a gross deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards attributable to United States of $319 million, before application of the valuation allowances. As of December31, 2011, the Company had a valuation allowance of $271 million for the full amount of the domestic net deferred tax asset, as it believes, based on the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized prior to the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards in various amounts through 2031. Furthermore, because the Company has no operations within the U.S. taxing jurisdiction, it is likely that sufficient generation of revenue to offset the Companys deferred tax asset is remote.
In 2011, the Company amended its 2009 US Federal Tax return to elect to deduct its previously benefited foreign income tax credits. This resulted in an increase to the Companys net operating loss carryforward and the elimination of the
116 BPZ RESOURCES,INC AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009
foreign income tax credit carryforward previously accrued as a deferred tax asset. Since the Company maintained a full valuation allowance against the net operating loss carryforward and the foreign tax credit carryforward deferred tax assets, the election to deduct the foreign tax credit resulted in no impact to overall tax expense.
At December31, 2011, the Company had recognized a gross deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards attributable to foreign jurisdictions of $76 million, before application of the valuation allowances, attributable to foreign net operating losses, which begin to expire in 2014. The Company is subject to Peruvian income tax on its earnings at a statutory rate, as defined in the Block Z-1 License Contract, of 22%. The Company assessed the realizability of the net deferred tax asset generated in Peru. The Company considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in Peru during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Based upon the level of historical taxable income, the availability of certain prudent and feasible income tax planning opportunities and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, along with the transition into the commercial phase under the Block Z-1 License Contract, the Company believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the majority of the these deductible differences at December31, 2011. In addition the Company has a $28 million valuation allowance on certain foreign deferred tax assets related to overhead allocations and exploration activities on Blocks XIX, XXII and XXII as it believes it may not receive the full benefit of these deductions. As a result, the Company recognized a net deferred tax asset of $261 million, related to its foreign operations, as of December31, 2011.
The Company recognized a total tax provision for the year ended December31, 2011 of approximately $24 million. No provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been made for the difference in the book and tax basis of the Companys investment in foreign subsidiaries as such amounts are considered permanently invested. Distribution of earnings, as dividends or otherwise, from such investments could result in U.S. federal taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable in various foreign countries. Due to the Companys significant net operating loss carryforward position the Company has not recognized any excess tax benefit related to its stock compensation plans. ASC Topic 718 prohibits the recognition of such benefits until the related compensation deduction reduces the current tax liability.
Estimated interest and penalties related to potential underpayment on unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are classified as a component of tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company did not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits, nor was any interest expense recognized during the year. The Company did not have any uncertain tax positions generated from unrecognized tax benefits resulting from differences between positions taken in tax returns and amounts recognized in the financial statement as of December31, 2011 or December31, 2010.
Note 18 Business Segment Information
The Company determines and discloses its segments in accordance with ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting ASC Topic 280,which uses a management approach for determining segments. The management approach designates the internal organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and assessing parlance as the source of the Companys reportable segments. ASC Topic 280 also requires disclosures about products or services, geographic areas, and major customers. The Companys management reporting structure provided for only one segment for the year ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Accordingly, no separate segment information is presented. In addition, the Company operates only in Peru and has only one customer for its oil production, Petroperu. The majority of the Companys long-lived assets are located in Peru. Management does not consider its investment in Ecuador as a separate business segment.
Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies
Extended Well Testing Regulation
On December13, 2009, legislation regulating well testing in Peru became effective under a Supreme Decree issued by the government of Peru. The regulation provides that all new wells may be placed on production testing for up to six months. If the operator believes additional testing is needed to properly evaluate the productive capacity of thefield, and can technically justify such need, a request for the well to enter into an Extended Well Test EWT period must be submitted to the General Directorate of Hydrocarbons DGH, the agency of the Ministry of Energy and Mines responsible for
117 BPZ RESOURCES,INC AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009
regulating the optimum development of oil and gas fields. After the initial six-month period or after an approved EWT program expires, the operator will be required to have the necessary gas and water reinjection equipment in place to continue producing the well according to existing environmental regulations. Additionally, during both the initial six-month testing period and any extended period that may be granted, the Company must also obtain gas flaring permits for each well in order for it to be in compliance with Peruvian environmental legislation.
Corvina Field Transition into Commercial Production
The Corvina field was put into commercial production on November30, 2010 in accordance with the revised First Date of Commercial Production approved by Perupetro, and is no longer subject to the EWT regulations described above.
With respect to other fields, unless additional EWT periods are approved, upon expiration of all such periods, all production would cease until the Company meets the requirements to transition into commercial production, including installation of water and gas reinjection facilities.
Extended Well Testing Program
The Company had been producing oil from the Albacora field since December2009 through late January2011, at which time the extended well testing permit and associated gas flaring permit expired. In January2011, the Company received notice from Perupetro that its application for extended well testing on the A-14XD well had been denied, and accordingly, the Company shut-in production from the well.
In April2011, the Company received authorization from the Ministry of Energy and Mines of Peru for interference testing, along with associated gas flaring, covering a four-month period beginning June1, 2011. The permits were for the A-14XD, A-9G, and A-13E oil wells, with the latter two having been drilled by a previous operator, and which were all shut-in at the Albacora platform. As a result, work related to interference testing of the A-9G and A-13E wells began in May2011. Additionally, the Company reopened the A-14XD well in June2011. The Company reopened the A-13E well in July2011, the A-9G well in September2011 and the A-12F in November2011, with each well producing intermittently, during the Companys interference testing program.
In July2011, the Company received an EWT permit with related gas flaring allowances that permitted continued testing operations on the three wells once the initial interference testing program ended in September2011. This permit allowed production from all three wells, from new zones, simultaneously through February2012.
In February2012, the Company received permits from the DGH to continue well testing on A-14XD, A-9G and A-13E wells until July1, 2012, or until the Company receives the required environmental permit for gas injection, whichever comes first. In addition, the Companys request was granted by the DGH to permit testing on the A-12F to allow a determination to be made whether to use this well as either a gas injector or oil producer.
The Albacora field is subject to the EWT regulations until the Company receives the required environmental permit to inject gas.
With respect to any additional EWT and gas flaring permits that are requested, the Company can give no assurance that the DGH or the Ministry of Energy and Mines will grant approval of any current or future permits requested by the Company.
Ecuadorian Hydrocarbon Law
In July2010, the Company was notified of changes to the Ecuadorian hydrocarbon law that included provisions that will allow the Ecuadorian government to nationalize oil fields if a private operator does not agree to contractual changes mandated by the new hydrocarbon laws. The consortium, of which the Company is a participant, successfully negotiated a service contract during the fourth quarter of 2010; as such, the Company does not believe there is a significant risk of nationalization of its interest in the Santa Elena field.The Company is still reviewing the impact of this new law, if any, as it pertains to its 10% net investment interest in an oil and gas property in Ecuador. For further information see Note-6 118 BPZ RESOURCES,INC AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009
Investment in Ecuador Property. However, the Company does not believe any such impact on its Ecuadorian investment will have a material impact on the Companys overall financial position.
Profit Sharing
The Constitution of Peru and Legislative Decree Nos. 677 and 892 gives employees working in private companies engaged in activities generating income as defined by the Income Tax Law the right to share in the companys profits. According to Article3 of the United Nations International Standard Industrial Classification, BPZ EPs tax category is classified under the mining companies section, which sets the rate at 8%. However, in Peru, the Hydrocarbon Law states, and the Supreme Court ruled, that hydrocarbons are not related to mining activities. Hydrocarbons are included under Companies Performing Other Activities, thus Oil and Gas Companies pay profit sharing at a rate of 5%. The 5% of income is determined by calculating a percentage of the Companys Peruvian subsidiaries annual total revenues subject to income tax less the expenses required to produce revenue or maintain the source of revenues. The benefit granted by the law to employees is calculated on the basis of income subject to taxation per the Peruvian tax code, and not based on income/loss before incomes taxes as reported under GAAP. For the year ended December31, 2011 and December31, 2010, respectively, profit sharing expense was not material to the Company as the Companys Peruvian subsidiaries did not have a material amount of income subject to taxation per the Peruvian tax code as a result of declaring commercial production in the Corvina field, which allowed certain exploration and development costs to be deductible in 2011 and 2010 that were not deductible in previous years. For the year ended December31, 2009, approximately $13 million of expense related to profit sharing is included in General and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as the Companys Peruvian subsidiaries had income subject to taxation per the Peruvian tax code. The Company is subject to profit sharing expense any year its Peruvian subsidiaries are profitable according to the Peruvian tax laws.
Gas-to-Power Project Financing
The gas-to-power project entails the installation of an approximately 10-mile gas pipeline from the CX-11 platform to shore, the construction of gas processing facilities and the building of an approximately 135 megawatt MW simple-cycle electric generating plant. The power plant site is located adjacent to an existing substation and power transmission lines, which after the Peruvian government completes their expansion, are expected to be capable of handling up to 420 MW of power. The existing substation and transmission lines are owned and operated by third parties.
The Company currently estimates the gas-to-power project will cost approximately $1535 million, excluding working capital and 18% value-added tax which will be recovered via future revenue billings. The $1535 million includes $1335 million for the estimated cost of the power plant and $200 million for the estimated cost of the construction of the natural gas pipeline. While the Company has held initial discussions with several potential joint venture partners for the gas-to-power project in an attempt to secure additional financing and other resources for the project, the Company has not entered into any definitive agreements with a potential partner. In the event the Company is able to identify and reach an agreement with a potential joint venture partner, it may only retain a minority position in the project. However, the Company expects to retain the responsibility for the construction of the pipeline as well as retain ownership of the pipeline. If the Company is unable to identify and reach an agreement with a potential partner, it plans to continue moving the project forward to completion without a partner. The Company has obtained certain permits and is in the process of obtaining additional permits to move the project forward.
Contracts for CX-15 Platform at the Corvina Field
In the third quarter of 2011, Soluciones Energeticas S.R.L., a subsidiary of the Company, finalized contracts with a third party, to fabricate, mobilize and install a second platform at the Corvina field in offshore Block Z-1. The estimated total project cost of the CX-15 project, including all production and compression equipment, is expected to be approximately $600 million. The Company has guaranteed payment of the platform contracts.

Note 20 Legal Proceedings
Navy Tanker Litigation
On October24, 2007, Tecnomarine SAC, a contractor to BPZ EP, entered into two short-term agreements with the Peruvian Navys commercial branch to charter two small tankers for use in the Companys offshore oil production operation. On January30, 2008, one of the tankers, the Supe, sank after catching fire.Neither of the Peruvian governmental agencies charged with investigating the incident found fault with Tecnomarine SAC or the Companys subsidiary, BPZ EP. A lawsuit was nonetheless filed on December18, 2008 in the 152nd Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas by two crewmembers and the family and estate of two deceased sailors injured in the incident, claiming negligence and gross negligence on the part of BPZ Resources,Inc. and BPZ Energy, LLC, parent entities of BPZ EP, that were not parties to the charter agreement and were not involved in the operations. Based on the Companys assessment of the available facts, including the fact that none of the Peruvian government-sanctioned investigations into the Supe incident found fault on the part of Tecnomarine SAC or BPZ EP, the Company does not believe the outcome of the legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company is vigorously defending this action but caution that there is inherent risk in litigation, which is difficult to quantify, especially at the early stage of litigation proceedings. In any event, the Company believes that any monetary damages arising from the incident would be adequately covered by insurance policies, after a customary deductible.
From time to time the Company may become a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company is not currently a party to any proceeding that it believes could have a potential material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Additionally, the Company is subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and natural gas industry in general, the business and prospects of the Company could be adversely affected.
Note 21 Operating Leases and Purchase Obligations
The Company is committed under various operating leases. Rent expense incurred for the year ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $11 million, $16 million and $14 million, respectively.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES UNAUDITED
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009
Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures
Oil and Natural Gas Producing Activities
The following disclosures for the Company are made in accordance with ASC Topic 932, Extractive Activities Oil and Gas and SEC rulesfor oil and gas reporting disclosures. Users of this information should be aware that the process of estimating quantities of proved, proved developed and proved undeveloped crude oil and natural gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the significance of the subjective decisions required and variances in available data for various reservoirs make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates presented in connection with financial statement disclosures. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas ultimately recovered.
SEC and FASB Updates on Oil and Gas reporting
On December31, 2008 the SEC adopted the final rulesregarding amendments to current oil and gas reporting requirements. See Recent Accounting pronouncements under Note-1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies for further information. The amendments are designed to modernize and update the oil and gas disclosure requirements to align them with current practices and changes in technology. Additionally, in January2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2010-3, Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures, to align its reporting guidance with the new SEC rules. The Company adopted these ruleseffective December31, 2009 and the changes, including those related to pricing, are included in the Companys reserve estimates.
The most significant changes to the Companys reserve estimates as a result of the new rulesare as follows Requiring companies to report oil and gas reserves using an un-weighted average price based upon the prior 12-month period rather than year-end prices Requiring companies to report the independence and qualifications of a preparer or auditor, based on current Society of Petroleum Engineers criteria Requiring the filing of reports for companies that rely on a third party to prepare reserves estimates or conduct a reserves audit; and
Limiting proved undeveloped reserves locations to those that are scheduled to be drilled within the next five years.
Reserves
Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made.
Proved developed reserves are proved reserves expected to be recovered, through wells and equipment in place and under operating methods being utilized at the time the estimates were made.
Proved undeveloped reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units that are reasonably certain of production when drilled. Proved reserves for other undrilled units can be claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation. Estimates for proved undeveloped reserves are not attributed to any
123 acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir.
Our relevant management controls over proved reserve attribution, estimation and evaluation include controls over and processes for the collection and processing of all pertinent operating data and documents needed by our independent reservoir engineers to estimate our proved reserves engagement of well qualified and independent reservoir engineers for review of our operating data and documents and preparation of reserve reports annually in accordance with all SEC reserve estimation guidelines review by our senior reservoir engineer and his staff of the independent reservoir engineers reserves reports for completion and accuracy; and
oversight and review by our Technical Committee, made up of independent members of the Board of Directors, who review the propriety of our methodology and procedures for determining the oil and gas reserves as well as the reserves estimates resulting from such methodology and procedures. The Technical Committee may also review the qualifications, independence and performance of our independent reserve engineers.
Beginning December31, 2009, an un-weighted average of the first-day-of-the month price based upon the prior 12-month period is used for future sales of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. Future operating costs, production taxes and capital costs will be based on current costs as of each year-end, with no escalation. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production and timing of development expenditures. Reserve data represent estimates only and should not be construed as being exact. Moreover, the standardized measure should not be construed as the current market value of the proved oil and natural gas reserves or the costs that would be incurred to obtain equivalent reserves. A market value determination would include many additional factors including aanticipated future changes in natural gas and crude oil prices, production and development costs, ban allowance for return on investment, cthe value of additional reserves, not considered proved at present, which may be recovered as a result of further exploration and development activities, and dother business risk.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves PUD or PUDs
As of December31, 2011, we had a total quantity of 22 PUDs contributing 282 MMbbls to our 2011 proved oil reserves. Of the total 22 PUDs, 18 PUDs are associated to the Corvina field and 4 PUDs are associated to the Albacora field. During the year ended December31, 2011, no PUD that contributed to the 2010 proved oil reserves were converted into proved developed reserves in the Corvina field or the Albacora field. Costs incurred to advance the development of PUDs in 2011 were approximately $266 million associated with the CX-15 platform. As of December31, 2011, we did not have any PUDs previously disclosed that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. As of December31, 2011, we have no PUD locations included in our proved oil reserves that are scheduled to be drilled after five years.At December31, 2011, one PUD location was added to proved undeveloped reserves that was previously categorized as proved developed non-producing reserves due to the decision to use the location as a gas injection well.

The Company does not currently have the financial  capacity or commitments for a development program of this magnitude for its  gas reserves. Accordingly, the Company has not included amounts of natural  gas reserves in its SEC filings. At such time as the Company obtains  sufficient financial commitments to proceed with the full development of the  gas-to-power project and all other conditions necessary to record proved  reserves are met, the Company expects to record SEC proved gas reserves as  permitted under SEC rulesand disclose such reserves in future SEC  filings.

The 2009 extensions, discoveries and other additions  of 228 MMBbls were due to additional wells drilled in the Corvina field  128 MMBbls and the discoveries of the Albacora field 101 MMBbls. The  2010 extensions, discoveries and other additions of 26 MMBbls were due to  additional wells drilled in the Corvina field. In 2011, there were no changes  to the extensions, discoveries and other additions.    6  
The 2009 reserve analysis prepared by NSAI included  negative revisions due to the lower than expected performance of the  CX11-14D, CX11-18XD, and CX11-20XD wells and corresponding revisions of other  wells resulting in a negative revision of 16 MMBbls. The 2010 reserve  analysis as prepared by NSAI included positive revisions due to price of  approximately 347 MBbls that were partially offset by negative revisions of  approximately 28 MBbls due to performance. The 2011 reserve analysis prepared  by NSAI included negative revisions due to performance of 32 MMBbls, partially  offset by positive revisions due to price of 04 MMBbls. The negative revisions were due to the  lower than expected performance of our 2010 proved developed non producing  wells that were intervened in 2011 in the Corvina field and in the Albacora  field, of which the majority of the revision came from performance of the  proved developed non producing wells associated with the Albacora field. The 2011, 2010 and 2009 reserve reports as  prepared by NSAI used a $10656 per barrel price, a $7692 per barrel price  and a $5730 per barrel price, respectively.    7  
The 2009 oil production of 991 MBbls includes 984  MBbls from the Corvina field and 7 MBbls from the Albacora field. The 2010  oil production of 1,527 MBbls includes 1,123MBbls from the Corvina field and  404 MBbls from the Albacora field. The 2011 oil production of 1,376 MBbls  includes 1,255 MBbls from the Corvina field and 121 MBbls from the Albacora  field.     
129 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
The following information has been developed utilizing procedures prescribed by U.S. GAAP and based on natural gas and crude oil reserve and production volumes estimated by the independent petroleum reservoir engineers. This information may be useful for certain comparison purposes but should not be solely relied upon in evaluating the Company or its performance. Further, information contained in the following table should not be considered as representative of realistic assessments of future cash flows, nor should the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows be viewed as representative of the current value of the Companys oil and natural gas assets.
The future cash flows presented below are based on sales prices, cost rates and statutory income tax rates in existence as of the date of the projections. It is expected that material revisions to some estimates of natural gas and crude oil reserves may occur in the future, development and production of the reserves may occur in periods other than those assumed, and actual prices realized and costs incurred may vary significantly from those used. Income tax expense has been computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available, under current laws, and which relate to oil and natural gas producing activities.
Management does not rely upon the following information in making investment and operating decisions. Such decisions are based upon a wide range of factors, including estimates of probable as well as proved reserves and varying price and cost assumptions considered more representative of a range of possible economic conditions that may be anticipated.

Our disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
b Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There was no change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December31, 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
c Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management of the Company, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting, as defined in Rule13a-15fof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition.
Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. We did not identify any material weaknesses in our internal controls as a result of this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December31, 2011.
BDO USA, LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited our consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, which is set forth below under Attestation Report.
133 d Attestation Report
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders BPZ Resources,Inc. and Subsidiaries
Houston, Texas
We have audited BPZ Resources,Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. BPZ Resources,Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, BPZ Resources,Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of BPZ Resources,Inc. as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2011, and our report dated March14, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.   s/ BDO USA, LLP     Houston, TX
