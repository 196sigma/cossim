REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and 
Stockholders of IRIDEX Corporation     In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
stockholders' equity, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of IRIDEX Corporation and subsidiaries at
January 2, 1999 and December 31, 1997 and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 2,
1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted auditing standards, which require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.                          PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose, California

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.   BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY
Description of Business
IRIDEX Corporation is the leading worldwide provider of
semiconductor-based laser systems used to treat eye diseases in ophthalmology
and skin lesions in dermatology. We market our products using three brand names:
IRIS Medical to the ophthalmology market, IRIDERM to the dermatology market, and
Light Solutions to the research market. The terms Company, IRIDEX, we,
us and our refer to IRIDEX Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and, when
the context so requires, our wholly-owned subsidiaries, IRIS Medical
Instruments, Inc. and Light Solutions Corporation, both California corporations
and IRIDEX Foreign Sales Corporation, a Barbados corporation, and our
dermatology division IRIDERM.
2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Financial Statement Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our
wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90
days or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Available-for-Sale Securities
All marketable securities as of January 2, 1999 are considered to be
available-for-sale and therefore are carried at fair value. Available-for-sale
securities are classified as current assets when they have scheduled maturities
of less than one year. Available-for-sale securities are classified as non
current assets when they have scheduled maturities of more than one year.
Unrealized holding gains and losses on such securities are reported net of
related taxes as a separate component of stockholders' equity until realized.
Realized gains and losses on sales of all such securities are reported in
interest and other income and are computed using the specific identification
cost method.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets include patents that are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over seven years. We periodically assess the recoverability
of intangible assets by determining whether amortization of the asset balance
over the remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating
cash flows of the acquired operation. The amount of impairment, if any, is
measured based on projected discounted future operating cash flows and is
recognized as a write down of the asset to net realizable value.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined on a standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a
first-in, first-out FIFO method. Lower of cost or market is evaluated by
considering obsolescence, excessive levels of inventory, deterioration and other
factors.                    -35-

IRIDEX CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which is generally three years.
Amortization of leasehold improvements and property and equipment acquired under
capital lease obligations is computed using the straight-line method over the
shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the related
assets, typically three years.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize product sales when product is shipped to the customer, when
acceptance terms, if any, are fulfilled and when contractual obligations are
completed. We accrue for warranty costs and sales returns at the time of
shipment based on our experience.
Research and Development
Research and development expenditures are charged to operations as
incurred.
Advertising
We expense advertising costs as they are incurred. Advertising expenses
for 1998, 1997 and 1996 were $317,000, $170,000 and $175,000, respectively.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Carrying amounts of our financial instruments including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities
approximate fair values due to their short maturities. Estimated fair values for
available-for-sale securities, which are separately disclosed elsewhere, are
based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under SFAS No. 109,
deferred assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
Concentration of Credit Risk and Other Risks and Uncertainties
Our cash and cash equivalents are deposited in demand and money market
accounts of three financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed
the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally these deposits may
be redeemed upon demand and therefore, bear minimal risk.                    -36-

IRIDEX CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     We market our products to distributors and end-users throughout the
world. Sales to international distributors are generally made on open credit
terms and letter of credit. We also offer extended payment terms on selected
sales transactions. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of our
customers and maintains an allowance for potential credit losses. Historically
we have not experienced any significant losses related to individual customers
or group of customers in any particular geographic area. As of January 2, 1999,
no customers accounted for greater than 10% of accounts receivable.
Our products require approvals from the Food and Drug Administration and
international regulatory agencies prior to commercialized sales. Our future
products may not receive required approvals. If we were denied such approvals of
such approvals were delayed, it would have a materially adverse impact on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.
Use of Estimates
Management makes estimates and assumptions to prepare the financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These
estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fiscal Year
On June 8, 1998, the Board of Directors approved a resolution to adjust
our fiscal year end from December 31 to the 52 or 53-week period that ends the
Saturday nearest December 31, effective for fiscal year 1998. Fiscal year 1998
was a 52-week year.
Computation of Net Income Per Common Share and Per Diluted Common Share
Effective December 31, 1997, we adopted SFAS No. 128 Earnings Per
Share and the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 98, and accordingly all prior periods have been
restated. Net income per common share is computed using the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted net income per common
share is computed using the weighted average number of dilutive shares of common
stock and common equivalent shares from stock options and preferred stock
outstanding. We have determined that no incremental shares should be included in
the computation of earnings per share and in accordance with Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 98.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which

from time to time in one or more series. As of January 2, 1999, we had no
preferred stock issued and outstanding.
TREASURY STOCK
In December 1998, we instituted a stock repurchase program whereby up to
150,000 shares of our Common Stock may be repurchased in the open market. We
plan to utilize all of the reacquired shares for reissuance in connection with
employee stock programs. We have not repurchased any Common Stock as of January

STOCK OPTION PLANS
Amended and Restated 1989 Incentive Stock Plan
The Amended and Restated 1989 Plan the 1989 Plan provides for the
granting to employees including officers and employee directors of incentive
stock options and for the granting to employees including officers and employee
directors and consultants of nonstatutory stock options and stock purchase
rights SPRs. The exercise price of incentive stock options and SPRs granted
under the 1989 Plan must be at least equal to the fair market value of the
shares at the time of grant. With respect to any recipient who owns stock
possessing more than 10% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock,
the exercise price of any option or SPR granted must be at least equal to 110%
of the fair market value at the time of grant. Options granted under the 1989
Plan are exercisable at such times and under such conditions as determined by
the Administrator; generally over a four year period. The maximum term of
incentive stock options granted to any recipient must not exceed ten years;
provided, however, that the maximum term of an incentive stock option granted to
any recipient possessing more than 10% of the voting power of our outstanding
capital stock must not exceed five years. In the case of SPRs, unless the
Administrator determines otherwise, we have                    -40-

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS a repurchase option exercisable upon the voluntary or involuntary termination of
the purchaser employment with us for any reason including death or
disability. Such repurchase option lapses at a rate determined by the
Administrator. The purchase price for shares repurchased by us is the original
price paid by the purchaser and may be paid by cancellation of any indebtedness
of the purchaser to us. The 1989 Plan expires in August 1999.
1998 Stock Plan
The 1998 Stock Plan the 1998 Plan provides for the grant of options
and stock purchase rights to purchase shares of our Common Stock to employees
and consultants. A total of 250,000 shares of Common Stock are reserved for
issuance under the 1998 Plan. The stockholders approved the 1998 Plan in June
1998. The terms of the 1998 Plan are substantially the same as the 1989 Plan. 
The 1998 Plan expires in June 2008.
1995 Director Option Plan
In October 1995, we adopted the 1995 Director Option Plan the Director
Plan, under which members of the Board of Directors are granted options to
purchase 11,250 shares upon the first to occur of their appointment or the
adoption of the Director Plan First Option and an option to purchase 3,750
shares Subsequent Option on July 1 of each year thereafter provided that he
or she has served on the Board for at least the preceding six months. The
options granted are at fair market value on the date of grant. The First Option
becomes exercisable as to one-twelfth 1/12 of the shares subject to the First
Option for each quarter over a three-year period. Each Subsequent Option becomes
exercisable as to one-fourth 1/4 of the shares subject to the Subsequent
Option for each quarter, commencing one quarter after the First Option and any
previously granted Subsequent Options have become fully exercisable. Options
granted under the Director Plan have a term of 10 years.
In the event of our merger with or into another corporation, resulting
in a change of control, or the sale of substantially all of our assets, each
Director Plan option becomes exercisable in full and shall be exercisable for 30
days after written notice to the holder of the event causing the change in
control.
Unless terminated sooner, the Director Plan will terminate in 2005. The
Board has authority to amend or terminate the Director Plan, provided no such
amendment may impair the rights of any optionee without the optionee consent.

Dividend Yield        --       --       --       --        --            The weighted average expected life was calculated based on the exercise
behavior of each group. Group A represents officers and directors who are a
smaller group holding a greater average number of options than other option
holders and who tend to exercise later in the vesting period. Group B are all
other option holders, virtually all of whom are employees. This group tends to
exercise earlier in the vesting period.
The weighted average fair value per share of those options granted in
1998, 1997 and 1996 was $312, $385 and $442, respectively.
We have also estimated the fair value for the purchase rights issued
under our 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under the Black-Scholes valuation

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Our 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan was adopted
by the Board of Directors in October 1995. On April 28, 1997, the shareholders
approved an amendment to increase the total number of shares of common stock for
issuance under the Purchase Plan from 50,000 to 100,000. The Purchase Plan
permits eligible employees including officers and employee directors to
purchase Common Stock through payroll deductions, which may not exceed 10% of an
employee compensation. No employee may purchase more than $25,000 worth of
stock in any calendar year or more than 1,000 shares of Common Stock in any
twelve-month period. The price of shares purchased under the Purchase Plan is
85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Common Stock at the beginning
of the offering period or the end of the offering period. The Purchase Plan will
terminate in 2005, unless terminated sooner by the Board of Directors.
7.   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN
We have a plan known as the IRIS Medical Instruments 401k trust to
provide retirement benefits through the deferred salary deductions for
substantially all employees. Employees may contribute up to 15% of their annual
compensation to the plan, limited to a maximum amount set by the Internal
Revenue Service. The plan also provides for Company contributions at the
discretion of the Board of Directors. No Company contributions have been made to

9.   MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS
In 1998, we adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures abut Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information. We concluded that we operate in two
reportable segments: the laser medical device segment and the laser research
segment. In the laser medical device segment, we develop, manufacture and market
medical devices for the ophthalmology and dermatology markets. Our revenues
arise from the sale of consoles, delivery devices, disposables and service and
support activities. In the research segment we conduct research and development
under research grants from the U.S. Federal Government and others. Under the
terms of these grants we typically retain the right to commercially market the
technology developed. The laser research segment did not meet the quantitative
requirements for a reportable segment as defined in SFAS No. 131 and has been
aggregated accordingly.
In the years ended January 2, 1999, December 31, 1997 and 1996, no
customer individually accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.
