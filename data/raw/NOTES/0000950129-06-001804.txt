Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Houston, Texas We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Diamond Offshore Drilling,
Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, comprehensive income loss, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December
31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated February24, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting such management
assessment is included in Item9A of this Form 10-K and an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte Touche LLP Houston,

February24, 2006 49 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Houston, Texas We have audited managements assessment, included in Item9A of this Form 10-K under the
heading Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Diamond
Offshore Drilling, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on
our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based
on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2005, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December31, 2005 of the Company and our report dated February24, 2006 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those financial statements. Deloitte Touche LLP Houston, Texas

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization and Business Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. is a leading, global offshore oil and gas drilling contractor
with a current fleet of 44 offshore rigs consisting of 30 semisubmersibles, 13 jack-ups and one
drillship. In addition, we have two jack-up drilling units on order at shipyards in Brownsville,
Texas and Singapore, which we expect to be completed in the first quarter of 2008. Unless the
context otherwise requires, references in these Notes to Diamond Offshore, we, us or our
mean Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries. We were incorporated in
Delaware in 1989. As of February20, 2006, Loews Corporation, or Loews, owned 543% of the outstanding shares of
our common stock. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.
and our subsidiaries after elimination of significant intercompany transactions and balances. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities and Other Investments We consider short-term, highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three
months or less and deposits in money market mutual funds that are readily convertible into cash to
be cash equivalents. We classify our investments in marketable securities as available for sale and they are stated
at fair value. Accordingly, any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, are reported in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets in Accumulated other comprehensive losses until realized. The cost
of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity
and such adjustments are included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in Interest
income. The sale and purchase of securities are recorded on the date of the trade. The cost of
debt securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains or losses, as
well as any declines in value that are judged to be other than temporary, are reported in our
Consolidated Statements of Operations in Other income expense. Investments and marketable securities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31,
2004 also included $116million of time deposits converted from 150million Australian dollars
which matured through March2005. These securities did not meet the definition of debt securities
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and were therefore carried at cost, which we had
determined to approximate fair value. Derivative Financial Instruments Our derivative financial instruments include foreign currency forward exchange contracts and a
contingent interest provision that is embedded in our 15% Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2031,
or 15% Debentures, issued on April11, 2001. See Note 4. Supplementary Cash Flow Information We paid interest on long-term debt totaling $941million for the year ended December31,
2005, which included $733million in accreted interest paid in connection with the June2005
partial redemption of our Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures due 2020, or Zero Coupon Debentures,
and commitment fees. See Note 7. For the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, we made cash
payments for interest on long-term debt, including commitment fees, of $87million and $95
million, respectively. 56 Table of Contents We paid $53million, $31million and $85million in foreign income taxes, net of foreign
tax refunds, during the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. We received
refunds of U.S. income taxes of $77million and $390million during the years ended December31,
2005 and 2003, respectively. There were no U.S. income taxes paid or refunded during the year
ended December31, 2004. We recorded income tax benefits of $24million and $01million related to the exercise of
employee stock options in 2005 and 2004, respectively. During 2005, the holders of $13,000 in principal amount of our 15% Debentures elected to
convert their outstanding debentures into shares of our common stock. See Note 7. Rig Inventory and Supplies Our inventories consist primarily of replacement parts and supplies held for use in our
operations and are stated at the lower of cost or estimated value. Drilling and Other Property and Equipment Our drilling and other property and equipment is carried at cost. We charge maintenance and
routine repairs to income currently while replacements and betterments, which meet certain
criteria, are capitalized. Costs incurred for major rig upgrades are accumulated in construction
work-in-progress, with no depreciation recorded on the additions, until the month the upgrade is
completed and the rig is placed in service. Upon retirement or sale of a rig, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any gains or losses are
included in our results of operations. Depreciation is recognized up to applicable salvage values
by applying the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful lives from the year the
asset is placed in service. See Changes in Accounting Estimates. Capitalized Interest We capitalize interest cost for the construction and upgrade of qualifying assets. Beginning
in December2005 and April2005, we began capitalizing interest on expenditures related to the
construction of one of our newbuild jack-up rigs, the Ocean Scepter, and the upgrade of the Ocean
Endeavor for ultra-deepwater service, respectively. There were no capital projects for which
interest was capitalized during 2004. In 2003, we capitalized interest for the Ocean Rover through
July10, 2003, when its upgrade was completed. A reconciliation of our total interest cost to Interest expense as reported in our
Consolidated Statements of Operations is as follows

Assets Held-For-Sale We classify assets as held-for-sale when we have a plan for disposal and those assets meet the
held for sale criteria of SFAS No144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets. At December31, 2004, we had elected to market one of our cold-stacked rigs, the Ocean
Liberator, for sale to a third party and classified the $52million net book value of this
drilling unit as an asset held-for-sale, which is included in Prepaid expenses and other in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31, 2004. The estimated market value of the Ocean 57 Table of Contents Liberator, based on offers from third parties, was substantially higher than its carrying
value at December31, 2004; therefore, we determined that no write-down was necessary as a result
of the reclassification to held-for-sale. In June2005, we completed the sale of this drilling unit and received net cash proceeds of
$136million. We recognized an $80million gain on the transaction, which we have reported as
Gain on disposition of assets in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations requires the fair value of a
liability for an asset retirement legal obligation to be recognized in the period in which it is
incurred. At December31, 2005 and 2004, we had no asset retirement obligations. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We utilize a
probability-weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment. The
assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include   
dayrate by rig   
utilization rate by rig expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that
the rig would be used   
the per day operating cost for each rig if active,
ready-stacked or cold-stacked; and   
salvage value for each rig. Based on these assumptions and estimates a matrix is developed assigning probabilities to
various combinations of assumed utilization rates and dayrates. The impact of a 5% reduction in
assumed dayrates for the cold-stacked rigs holding all other assumptions and estimates in the
model constant, or alternatively the impact of a 5% reduction in utilization again holding all
other assumptions and estimates in the model constant is also considered as part of this analysis. At December31, 2005, there were no changes in circumstances that indicated that the carrying
value of our property and equipment, primarily drilling equipment, may not be recoverable. In
January2006, we announced our intent to upgrade our single cold-stacked rig, the Ocean Monarch,
to high-specification capabilities at an estimated cost of approximately $300million. Based on
this decision and the low net book value of the drilling rig, we do not believe that its carrying
value is impaired. At December31, 2004, we reviewed our two additional cold-stacked rigs at the time, the Ocean
Endeavor and the Ocean New Era, for impairment and determined that neither of the drilling units
was impaired. On January10, 2005, we announced that the Ocean Endeavor would be upgraded to a
high-specification drilling unit for an estimated cost of approximately $250million. As a result
of this decision and the low net book value of the rig, we did not consider this asset to be
impaired. At December31, 2005, the upgrade of the Ocean Endeavor upgrade was in-progress in a
Singapore shipyard. We evaluated our other cold-stacked rig, the Ocean New Era, for impairment using the
probability-weighted cash flow analysis discussed above. At December31, 2004 the
probability-weighted cash flow for the Ocean New Era significantly exceeded its net carrying value
of $32million. We subsequently reactivated the Ocean New Era from cold-stack status in December
2005. In
December2003, we reviewed all five of our then cold-stacked rigs for impairment. Using
the methodology discussed above, in all cases, the probability-weighted cash flows significantly
exceeded the carrying value of each rig. During 2003 we recognized $16million in impairment
charges to write down two of our semisubmersible drilling rigs, the Ocean Century and the Ocean
Prospector, to their fair market values following a decision to offer the rigs for sale. These
rigs were sold in December2003 for $375,000 each pre-tax. 58 Table of Contents Managements assumptions are an inherent part of an asset impairment evaluation and the use of
different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported. Fair Value of Financial Instruments We believe that the carrying amount of our current financial instruments approximates fair
value because of the short maturity of these instruments. For non-current financial instruments we
use quoted market prices, when available, and discounted cash flows to estimate fair value. See
Note 10. Debt Issuance Costs Debt issuance costs are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other assets and are
amortized over the term of the related debt. Interest expense for the year ended December31, 2005
includes $69million in debt issuance costs that we wrote-off in connection with the June2005
partial redemption of our outstanding Zero Coupon Debentures. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes,
which requires the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year
and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and
assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in our
financial statements or tax returns. In each of our tax jurisdictions we recognize a current tax
liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current
year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to
temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance,
if necessary, which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available
evidence, are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not approach. We make
judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to the
forecasting of our effective tax rate, the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as
utilization of foreign tax credits, and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax
returns upon audit. Our net income tax expense or benefit is a function of the mix between our domestic and
international pre-tax earnings or losses, respectively, as well as the mix of international tax
jurisdictions in which we operate. Certain of our international rigs are owned or operated,
directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited, a Cayman Island company which is
one of our wholly owned subsidiaries. Earnings from this subsidiary are reinvested internationally
and remittance to the U.S. is indefinitely postponed. See Note 13. Treasury Stock Depending on market conditions we may, from time to time, purchase shares of our common stock
in the open market or otherwise. We account for the purchase of treasury stock using the cost
method, which reports the cost of the shares acquired in Treasury stock as a deduction from
stockholders equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the year ended December31, 2004,
we purchased 782,200 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $181million, or at an
average cost of $2311 per share. We did not repurchase any shares of our outstanding common stock
during 2005. 59 Table of Contents Stock-Based Compensation Through December31, 2005, we accounted for our Second Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Option
Plan in accordance with Accounting Principles Board, or APB, Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for the options
granted to employees under the plan. Had compensation expense for our stock options been
recognized based on the fair value of the options at the grant dates, valued using the Binomial
Option pricing model, our net income lossand earnings lossper share would have been as

Comprehensive Income Loss Comprehensive income lossis the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period
from transactions and other events and circumstances except those transactions resulting from
investments by owners and distributions to owners. Comprehensive income lossfor the three years
ended December31, 2005 includes net income loss, foreign currency translation gains and losses
and unrealized holding gains and losses on marketable securities. See Note 8. Currency Translation Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Effective October1, 2005, we changed the
functional currency of certain of our subsidiaries operating outside the United States to the U.S.
dollar to more appropriately reflect the primary economic environment in which our subsidiaries
operate. Prior to this date, these subsidiaries utilized the local currency of the country in
which they conduct business as their functional currency. As a result of this change, currency
translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses are reported as Other income expensein
our Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, we
recognized net 60 Table of Contents foreign currency exchange losses of $08million and $14million, respectively. For the year
ended December31, 2003, we recognized net foreign currency exchange gains of $29million. Revenue Recognition Revenue from our dayrate drilling contracts is recognized as services are performed. In
connection with such drilling contracts, we may receive lump-sum fees for the mobilization of
equipment. These fees are earned as services are performed over the initial term of the related
drilling contracts. We previously accounted for the excess of mobilization fees received over
costs incurred to mobilize an offshore rig from one market to another as revenue over the term of
the related drilling contracts. Effective July1, 2004 we changed our accounting to defer
mobilization fees received, as well as direct and incremental mobilization costs incurred, and
began to amortize each, on a straight line basis, over the term of the related drilling contracts
which is the period estimated to be benefited from the mobilization activity. Straight line
amortization of mobilization revenues and related costs over the initial term of the related
drilling contracts which generally range from two to 60months is consistent with the timing of
net cash flows generated from the actual drilling services performed. If we had used this method
of accounting in periods prior to July1, 2004, our previously reported operating income lossand
net income losswould not have changed, and the impact on contract drilling revenues and expenses
would have been immaterial. Absent a contract, mobilization costs are recognized currently. From time to time, we may receive fees from our customers for capital improvements to our
rigs. We defer such fees received in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and
recognize these fees into income on a straight-line basis over the period of the related drilling
contract. We capitalize the costs of such capital improvements and depreciate them over the
estimated useful life of the asset. We record reimbursements received for the purchase of supplies, equipment, personnel services
and other services provided at the request of our customers in accordance with a contract or
agreement, for the gross amount billed to the customer, as Revenues related to reimbursable
expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in Accounting Estimates In April2003 we commissioned a study to evaluate the economic lives of our drilling rigs
because several of our rigs had reached or were approaching the end of their depreciable lives, yet
were still operating and were expected to operate for many more years. As a result of this study,
effective April1, 2003, we recorded changes in accounting estimates by increasing the estimated
service lives to 25years for our jack-ups and 30years for our semisubmersibles and drillship and
by increasing salvage values to 5% for most of our drilling rigs. The change in estimates was made
to better reflect the remaining economic lives and salvage values of our fleet. The effect of this
change in accounting estimates resulted in an increase in our net income for the year ended
December31, 2005 of $157million, or $011 per share, and a reduction to our net loss for the
years ended December31, 2004 and 2003 of $196million, or $015 per share, and $149million, or
$011 per share, respectively.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimated. Reclassifications Certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the
classifications currently followed. Such reclassifications do not affect earnings. 61 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December2004 the Financial Accounting Standards Board revised SFAS No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, or SFAS 123 R. This statement supersedes APB Opinion
No25 and its related implementation guidance. This statement requires that the compensation cost
relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. That cost will
be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. SFAS 123 R
was originally effective as of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June
15, 2005. In April2005, however, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule that
defers the required effective date of SFAS 123 Rfor registrants such as us until the beginning
of the first fiscal year beginning after June15, 2005. This statement applies to all awards
granted after the required effective date and to awards modified, repurchased or cancelled after
that date, as well as the unvested portion of awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS
123 R. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 123 Rto have a material impact on our
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 2. Earnings Loss Per Share A reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the basic and diluted per-share

Our computation of diluted earnings per share, or EPS, for the year ended December31,
2005 excludes stock options representing 22,088 shares of common stock because the options
exercise prices were higher than the average market price per share of our common stock for the
period. The computations of diluted EPS for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003 exclude
approximately 94million and 69million potentially dilutive shares of common stock issuable upon
conversion of our 15% Debentures and our Zero Coupon Debentures, respectively. Such shares were
not included in the EPS computations for 2004 or 2003 because the inclusion of such potentially
dilutive shares would have been antidilutive. See Note 7 for a description of our long-term debt. For the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, we excluded stock options representing 291,447
shares and 464,650 shares of common stock, respectively, from the computations of diluted EPS
because the options exercise prices were higher than the average market price per share of our
common stock for each period. We also excluded 62 Table of Contents other stock options representing 138,319 shares and
32,406 shares of common stock in 2004 and 2003, respectively, with an average market price in excess of their exercise prices from the computations of
diluted EPS for the respective periods because there was a net loss for each of the periods. 3. Investments and Marketable Securities We report our investments as current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Investments
and marketable securities, representing the investment of cash available for current operations.
At December31, 2004, Investments and marketable securities included $116million in time
deposits converted from 150million Australian dollars which matured through March2005. These
securities did not meet the definition of debt securities under SFAS No115, Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and were therefore carried at cost, which we
determined to approximate fair value. Our other investments in marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are

4. Derivative Financial Instruments Forward Exchange Contracts Our international operations expose us to foreign exchange risk, primarily associated with our
costs payable in foreign currencies for employee compensation and for purchases from foreign
suppliers. We utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce our forward exchange risk. A
forward currency exchange contract obligates a contract holder to exchange predetermined amounts of
specified foreign currencies at specified foreign exchange rates on specified dates. 63 Table of Contents During 2005, we entered into various foreign currency forward exchange contracts which
resulted in net realized gains totaling $11million. As of December31, 2005, we had foreign
currency exchange contracts outstanding requiring us to purchase the equivalent of $171million in
Mexican pesos, the equivalent of $77million in Australia dollars, the equivalent of $672million
in British pounds sterling and the equivalent of $305million in Brazilian Reals at various times
through March2007. We expect to settle an aggregate of $1168million and $57million of these
forward exchange contracts in 2006 and 2007, respectively. These forward contracts are derivatives as defined by SFAS No133, Accounting for
Derivatives and Hedging Activities, or SFAS 133. SFAS No133 requires that each derivative be
stated in the balance sheet at its fair value with gains and losses reflected in the income
statement except that, to the extent the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting, the gains and
losses are reflected in income in the same period as offsetting losses and gains on the qualifying
hedged positions. The forward contracts we entered into in 2005 did not qualify for hedge
accounting. In accordance with SFAS 133, we recorded a net pre-tax unrealized gain of $04million
in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December31, 2005, as Other income
expense to adjust the carrying value of these derivative financial instruments to their fair
value. We have presented the $04million fair value of these foreign currency forward exchange
contracts at December31, 2005 as Prepaid expenses and other in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In June2002 we entered into forward contracts to purchase 500million Australian dollars,
42million Australian dollars to be purchased monthly from August29, 2002 through June26, 2003
and 38million Australian dollars to be purchased on July31, 2003. These forward contracts were
derivatives as defined by SFAS 133, but did not qualify for hedge accounting. We recorded a
pre-tax gain of $23million in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended
December31, 2003 related to the settlement of these contracts. As of December31, 2003, we had
satisfied all obligations under these contracts. We did not enter into any forward exchange
contracts in 2004. Contingent Interest Our 15% Debentures, of which an aggregate principal amount of $4600million are outstanding,
contain a contingent interest provision. The contingent interest component is an embedded
derivative as defined by SFAS No133 and accordingly must be split from the host instrument and
recorded at fair value on the balance sheet. The contingent interest component had no fair value
at issuance or at December31, 2005 or at December31, 2004. 64 Table of Contents 5. Drilling and Other Property and Equipment Cost and accumulated depreciation of drilling and other property and equipment are summarized

to ultra-deepwater service, which we expect to be completed in mid-2007, and $859million related
to the construction of two new jack-up drilling units, the Ocean Scepter and the Ocean Shield.
Additionally, in August2005, we purchased a Victory-class semisubmersible drilling rig, the Ocean
Monarch, and related equipment for $200million which is included in drilling rigs and equipment. On August29, 2005, our jack-up drilling rig, the Ocean Warwick, was declared a constructive
total loss as a result of damages sustained during Hurricane Katrina, and we wrote off its net
carrying value of $140million in the third quarter of 2005. See Note 15. 6. Accrued Liabilities Accrued liabilities consist of the following

4875% Senior Notes On June14, 2005, we issued $2500million aggregate principal amount of 4875% Senior Notes
Due July1, 2015, or 4875% Senior Notes, at an offering price of 99785% of the principal amount
resulting in net proceeds to us of $2476million, exclusive of accrued issuance costs. Our 4875% Senior Notes bear interest at 4875% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on
January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning January1, 2006, and mature on July1, 2015. The
4875% Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Diamond Offshore Drilling,
Inc., and they rank equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness, although the 4875% Senior Notes will be effectively subordinated to
all existing and future obligations of our subsidiaries. We have the right to redeem all or a
portion of the 4875% Senior Notes for cash at any time or from time to time on at least 15days
but not more than 60days prior written notice, at the redemption price specified in the governing
indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. 66 Table of Contents 515% Senior Notes On August27, 2004, we issued $2500million aggregate principal amount of 515% Senior Notes
Due September1, 2014, or 515% Senior Notes, at an offering price of 99759% of the principal
amount resulting in net proceeds to us of $2476million. Our 515% Senior Notes bear interest at 515% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on
March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning March1, 2005, and mature on September1, 2014.
The 515% Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Diamond Offshore Drilling,
Inc., and they rank equal in right of payment to our existing and future unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness, although the 515% Senior Notes will be effectively subordinated to
all existing and future obligations of our subsidiaries. We have the right to redeem all or a
portion of the 515% Senior Notes for cash at any time or from time to time on at least 15days but
not more than 60days prior written notice, at the redemption price specified in the governing
indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Zero Coupon Debentures We issued our Zero Coupon Debentures, on June6, 2000 at a price of $49960 per $1,000
principal amount at maturity, which represents a yield to maturity of 350% per year. The Zero
Coupon Debentures mature on June6, 2020. We will not pay interest prior to maturity unless we
elect to convert the Zero Coupon Debentures to interest-bearing debentures upon the occurrence of
certain tax events. The Zero Coupon Debentures are convertible at the option of the holder at any
time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed, into our common stock at a fixed conversion
rate of 86075 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount at maturity of Zero Coupon
Debentures, subject to adjustments in certain events. In addition, holders
may require us to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their Zero Coupon Debentures upon a
change in control as defined in the governing indenture for a purchase price equal to the
accreted value through the date of repurchase. The Zero Coupon Debentures are senior unsecured
obligations of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. We also have the right to redeem the Zero Coupon Debentures, in whole or in part, for a price
equal to the issuance price plus accrued original issue discount through the date of redemption.
Holders have the right to require us to repurchase the Zero Coupon Debentures on June6, 2010 and
June6, 2015, at the accreted value through the date of repurchase. We may pay any such repurchase
price with either cash or shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common
stock. On June7, 2005, we repurchased $4600million accreted value, or $7741million in aggregate
principal amount at maturity, of our Zero Coupon Debentures at a purchase price of $59425 per
$1,000 principal amount at maturity, which represented 96% of our then outstanding Zero Coupon
Debentures. As of December31, 2005, the aggregate accreted value of our outstanding Zero Coupon
Debentures was $187million, which is classified as long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The aggregate principal amount at maturity of those Zero Coupon Debentures will be $309
million assuming no additional conversions or redemptions occur prior to the maturity date. In connection with the retirement of a portion of our Zero Coupon Debentures, we expensed $69
million in debt issuance costs associated with the retired debentures, which we have included in
interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December31, 2005. 15% Debentures On April11, 2001, we issued $4600million principal amount of 15% Debentures, which are due
April15, 2031. The 15% Debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial
conversion rate of 203978 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 15% Debentures, or $4902 per
share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we have the right to
deliver cash in lieu of shares of our common stock. We pay interest of 15% per year on the outstanding principal amount of the 15% Debentures,
semiannually in arrears on April15 and October15 of each year. In addition, under certain
circumstances we will pay contingent interest to holders of our 15% Debentures during any
six-month period commencing after April14, 2008. The 15% Debentures are unsecured obligations of
Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. 67 Table of Contents We will pay contingent interest to holders of the 15% Debentures during any six-month
period commencing after April15, 2008, if the average market price of a 15% Debenture for a
measurement period preceding such six-month period equals 120% or more of the principal amount of
such 15% Debenture and we pay a regular cash dividend during such six-month period. The
contingent interest payable per $1,000 principal amount of 15% Debentures, in respect of any
quarterly period, will equal 50% of regular cash dividends we pay per share on our common stock
during that quarterly period multiplied by the conversion rate. This contingent interest component
is an embedded derivative, which had no fair value at issuance or at December31, 2005 or December
31, 2004. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their 15% Debentures on April15,
2008, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 15% Debentures to be purchased plus
accrued and unpaid interest. We may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or shares of our
common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. In addition, holders may require us to
purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their 15% Debentures upon a change in control as defined
in the governing indenture for a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued
and unpaid interest. Additionally, we have the option to redeem all or a portion of the 15%
Debentures at any time on or after April15, 2008, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount
plus accrued and unpaid interest. During the third quarter of 2005, the holders of $13,000 in principal amount of our 15%
Debentures elected to convert their outstanding debentures into shares of our common stock. These
15% Debentures were converted at the rate of 203978 shares per $1,000 principal amount of
debentures, or $4902 per share, resulting in the issuance of 264 shares of our common stock in
2005. Ocean Alliance Lease-Leaseback The lease-leaseback agreement we entered into with a European bank in December2000 expired in
December2005. The lease-leaseback agreement provided for us to lease the Ocean Alliance, one of
our high-specification semisubmersible drilling rigs, to the bank for a lump-sum payment of $550
million plus an origination fee of $11million and for the bank to then sub-lease the rig back to
us. Under the agreement, which had a five-year term, we made five annual payments of $137
million. This financing arrangement had an effective interest rate of 713%. 8. Other Comprehensive Income Loss The income tax effects allocated to the components of our other comprehensive income loss

9. Commitments and Contingencies Various claims have been filed against us in the ordinary course of business, including claims
by offshore workers alleging personal injuries. In accordance with SFAS No5, Accounting for
Contingencies, we have assessed each claim or exposure to determine the likelihood that the
resolution of the matter might ultimately result in an adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. When we determine that an unfavorable resolution of a matter
is probable and such amount of loss can be determined, we record a reserve for the estimated loss
at the time that both of these criteria are met. Our management believes that we have established adequate reserves for any liabilities that
may reasonably be expected to result from these claims. In the opinion of our management, no
pending or threatened claims, actions or proceedings against us are expected to have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Litigation. In January2005, we were notified that we had been named as a defendant in a
lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana on behalf of Total
EP USA, Inc. and several oil companies alleging that the Ocean America had damaged a natural gas
pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico during Hurricane Ivan in September2004. The lawsuit was formally
served on us on May16, 2005 and it alleges that on or about September15, 2004 the Ocean America
broke free from its moorings and, as the rig drifted, its anchor, wire cable and other 69 Table of Contents parts struck and damaged various components of the Canyon Express Common System curtailing its
supply of natural gas to, and preventing production from, several fields. The plaintiffs seek
damages from us including, but not limited to, loss of revenue, that are currently estimated to be
in excess of $100million, together with interest, attorneys fees and costs. We deny any
liability for plaintiffs alleged loss and do not believe that ultimate liability, if any,
resulting from this litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we have given notice to our insurance
underwriters that a potential loss may exist with respect to this incident. Our deductible for
this type of loss is $2million. During the third quarter of 2004, we were notified that some of our subsidiaries had been
named, along with other defendants, in several complaints that had been filed in the Circuit Courts
of the State of Mississippi by approximately 800 persons alleging that they were employed by some
of the named defendants between approximately 1965 and 1986. The complaints also named as
defendants over 25 other companies that are not affiliated with us. The complaints alleged that
the defendants manufactured, distributed or utilized drilling mud containing asbestos and, in the
case of us and the several other offshore drilling companies named as defendants, that such
defendants allowed such drilling mud to have been utilized aboard their offshore drilling rigs.
The plaintiffs seek, among other things, an award of unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.
To date, we have been served with 29 complaints, of which 13 complaints were filed against
Arethusa Off-Shore Company and 16 complaints were filed against Diamond Offshore USA, Inc. now
known as Diamond Offshore USAL.L.C. and formerly known as Odeco Drilling, Inc. We filed
motions to dismiss each of these cases based upon a number of legal grounds, including naming
improper parties. In April2005 the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss, with prejudice, all 13
complaints filed against Arethusa Off-Shore Company after we demonstrated that the claims could not
be maintained against us or any of our subsidiaries. In addition, we expect to receive complete
defense and indemnity for the remaining 16 complaints from Murphy Exploration Production Company
pursuant to the terms of our 1992 asset purchase agreement with them. Accordingly, we do not
believe that ultimate liability, if any, resulting from this litigation will have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Various other claims have been filed against us in the ordinary course of business. In the
opinion of our management, no pending or known threatened claims, actions or proceedings against us
are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. Other. Our operations in Brazil have exposed us to various claims and assessments related to
our personnel, customs duties and municipal taxes, among other things, that have arisen in the
ordinary course of business. At December31, 2005, our loss reserves related to our Brazilian
operations aggregated $141million, of which $35million and $106million were recorded in
Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Loss reserves related to our Brazilian operations totaled $130million at December31, 2004, of
which $09million was recorded in Accrued liabilities and $121million was recorded in Other
liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We intend to defend these matters vigorously; however, we cannot predict with certainty the
outcome or effect of any litigation matters specifically described above or any other pending
litigation or claims. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits. Personal Injury Claims. Our uninsured retention of liability for personal injury claims,
which primarily results from Jones Act liability in the Gulf of Mexico, is $05million per claim
with an additional aggregate annual deductible of $15million. Our in-house claims department
estimates the amount of our liability for our retention. This department establishes a reserve for
each of our personal injury claims by evaluating the existing facts and circumstances of each claim
and comparing the circumstances of each claim to historical experiences with similar past personal
injury claims. Our claims department also estimates our liability for claims that are incurred but
not reported by using historical data. Historically, our ultimate liability for personal injury
claims has not differed materially from our recorded estimates. At December31, 2005, our
estimated liability for personal injury claims was $389million, of which $83million and $306
million were recorded in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities, respectively, in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December31, 2004, we had recorded loss reserves for personal
injury claims aggregating $334million, of which $80million and $254million were recorded in
Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ materially from our estimated
amounts due to uncertainties such as 70 Table of Contents   
the severity of personal injuries claimed   
significant changes in the volume of personal injury claims   
the unpredictability of legal jurisdictions where the claims will ultimately be litigated   
inconsistent court decisions; and   
the risks and lack of predictability inherent in personal injury litigation. Purchase Obligations. As of December31, 2005, we had purchase obligations aggregating
approximately $411million related to the major upgrade of the Ocean Endeavor and construction of
two new jack-up rigs, the Ocean Scepter and Ocean Shield. We anticipate that expenditures related
to these shipyard projects will be approximately $259million, $124million and $28million in
2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. However, the actual timing of these expenditures will vary
based on the completion of various construction milestones, which are beyond our control. We had no other purchase obligations for major rig upgrades or any other significant
obligations at December31, 2005 and 2004, except for those related to our direct rig operations,
which arise during the normal course of business. Operating Leases. We lease office facilities and equipment under operating leases, which
expire at various times through the year 2009. Total rent expense amounted to $31million, $29
million and $18million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Future minimum rental payments under leases are approximately $19million, $05million, $82,000
and $5,000 for the years ending December31, 2006 through 2009, respectively. There are no minimum
future rental payments under leases after 2009. Letters of Credit and Other. We are contingently liable as of December31, 2005 in the amount
of $479million under certain performance, bid, supersedeas and custom bonds and letters of
credit. Agreements relating to approximately $340million of multi-year performance bonds can
require cash collateral for the full line at any time for any reason. Issuers of a $05million
letter of credit have the option to require cash collateral due to the lowering of our credit
rating in April2004. As of December31, 2005 we had not been required to make any cash collateral
deposits with respect to these agreements. The remaining agreements cannot require cash collateral
except in events of default. On our behalf, banks have issued letters of credit securing certain
of these bonds. 71 Table of Contents 10. Financial Instruments Concentrations of Credit and Market Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit or
market risk consist primarily of periodic temporary investments of excess cash and trade accounts
receivable and investments in debt securities, including treasury inflation-indexed protected bonds
and mortgage-backed securities. We place our excess cash investments in high quality short-term
money market instruments through several financial institutions. At times, such investments may be
in excess of the insurable limit. We periodically evaluate the relative credit standing of these
financial institutions as part of our investment strategy. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to our trade accounts receivable are limited
primarily due to the entities comprising our customer base. Since the market for our services is
the offshore oil and gas industry, this customer base consists primarily of major oil and
independent oil and gas producers and government-owned oil companies. We provide allowances for
potential credit losses when necessary. No such allowances were deemed necessary for the years
presented and, historically, we have not experienced significant losses on our trade receivables. All of our investments in debt securities are U.S. government securities or U.S.
government-backed with minimal credit risk. However, we are exposed to market risk due to price
volatility associated with interest rate fluctuations. Fair Values The amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents,
marketable securities, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value. Fair
values and related carrying values of our debt instruments are shown below

We have estimated the fair value amounts by using appropriate valuation methodologies and
information available to management as of December31, 2005 and 2004. Considerable judgment is
required in developing these estimates, and accordingly, no assurance can be given that the
estimated values are indicative of the amounts that would be realized in a free market exchange.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of
financial instrument for which it was practicable to estimate that value   
Cash and cash equivalents The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of
the short maturity of these instruments.   
Marketable securities The fair values of the debt securities, including
mortgage-backed securities, available for sale were based on the quoted closing market
prices on December31, 2005 and 2004.   
Accounts receivable and accounts payable The carrying amounts approximate fair
value based on the nature of the instruments.   
Long-term debt The fair value of our Zero Coupon Debentures, 15% Debentures,
4875% Senior Notes and 515% Senior Notes was based on the quoted closing market price
on December31, 2005 and 2004 from brokers of these instruments. The fair value of the
Ocean Alliance lease-leaseback was 72 Table of Contents   
based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of 427%
at December31, 2004. 11. Related-Party Transactions We are party to a services agreement with Loews, or the Services Agreement, pursuant to which
Loews performs certain administrative and technical services on our behalf. Such services include
personnel, telecommunications, purchasing, internal auditing, accounting, data processing and cash
management services, in addition to advice and assistance with respect to preparation of tax
returns and obtaining insurance. Under the Services Agreement, we are required to reimburse Loews
for iallocated personnel costs such as salaries, employee benefits and payroll taxes of the
Loews personnel actually providing such services and iiall out-of-pocket expenses related to the
provision of such services. The Services Agreement may be terminated at our option upon 30days
notice to Loews and at the option of Loews upon six months notice to us. In addition, we have
agreed to indemnify Loews for all claims and damages arising from the provision of services by
Loews under the Services Agreement unless due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
Loews. We were charged $04million, $03million and $04million by Loews for these support
functions during the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 12. Stock Option Plan Our Second Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Option Plan, or the Stock Plan, provides for the
issuance of either incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options to our employees,
consultants and non-employee directors. Options may be granted to purchase stock at no less than
100% of the market price of the stock on the date the option is granted. On May23, 2005 the Stock
Plan was amended to allow for the award of stock appreciation rights either in tandem with or
separate from stock option grants and to grant the authority to administer the Stock Plan with
respect to certain of our executive officers to the Incentive Compensation Committee of our board
of directors. A maximum of 1,500,000 shares of our common stock are issuable under the Stock Plan, of which
385,110 shares had been issued as of December31, 2005. Unless otherwise specified by our Board of
Directors at the time of the grant, stock options have a maximum term of ten years, subject to
earlier termination under certain conditions and vest over four years. The following table summarizes the stock option activity related to our Stock Plan

$47million and $48million reflected in Prepaid expenses and other in
our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Certain of our international rigs are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by
Diamond Offshore International Limited, a Cayman Island subsidiary which we wholly own. We do not
intend to remit earnings from this subsidiary to the U.S. and we plan to indefinitely reinvest
these earnings internationally. Consequently, no U.S. taxes have been provided on earnings and no
U. S. tax benefits have been recognized on losses generated by the subsidiary. We have certain other non-U.S. subsidiaries for which U.S. taxes have been provided to the
extent a U.S. tax liability could arise upon remittance of earnings from the non-U.S. subsidiaries.
As of December31, 2005, we provided $02million of U.S. taxes attributable to undistributed
earnings of the non-U.S. subsidiaries. On actual remittance, certain countries may impose
withholding taxes that, subject to certain limitations, are then available for use as tax credits
against a U.S. tax liability, if any. We had $153million of foreign tax credit carryforwards as of December31, 2005. At the end
of 2004, we had established a valuation allowance of $103million for certain of our foreign tax
credit carryforwards which will begin to expire in 2011. During 2005, we were able to utilize most
of our net operating loss carryforwards see discussion below to offset taxable income generated
during the year. As a result, we now expect to be able to utilize $145million of our available
foreign tax credit carryforwards prior to the expiration dates for utilizing those credits and we
believe that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary for those credits. With respect to the
remaining $08million of foreign tax credit carryovers, we intend to pursue all opportunities and
tax planning strategies in order to be able to utilize our remaining foreign tax credit
carryforwards. However, under the more likely than not approach of evaluating the associated
deferred tax assets, we believe that a valuation allowance is necessary for our remaining foreign
tax credit carryovers, resulting in a valuation allowance of $08million as of December31, 2005. As of December31, 2005, we had net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of approximately
$105million available to offset future taxable income. The NOL carryforwards consist entirely of
losses that were acquired in 1996 from our merger with Arethusa Off-Shore Limited, or Arethusa.
The utilization of the NOL carryforwards acquired in the Arethusa merger is limited pursuant to
Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. We expect to fully
utilize all of the NOL carryforwards in future tax years. During 2005, we were able to utilize
approximately $202million of net operating losses generated in years prior to 2005. Of NOL
carryforwards utilized in 2005, approximately $11million of the $202million were from losses
acquired with the Arethusa merger. 75 Table of Contents We have recorded a deferred tax asset of $37million for the benefit of the NOL
carryforwards. The NOL carryforwards will expire as follows

During 2004 and 2005, the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, examined our federal income
tax returns for tax years 2000 and 2002. The examination was concluded during the fourth quarter
of 2005. We and the IRS agreed to a limited number of adjustments for which we recorded additional
income tax expense of $19million in 2005. At December31, 2004 we had a reserve of $89million $17million included with Current
Taxes Payable and $72million in Other Liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet for the
exposure related to the disallowance of goodwill deductibility associated with a 1996 acquisition.
During 2005 we concluded that the reserve was no longer necessary and eliminated the reserve, which
resulted in an income tax benefit of $89million. During 2005, we settled an income tax dispute in East Timor formerly part of Indonesia for
approximately $02million. At December31, 2004, our books reflected an accrued liability of $44
million related to potential East Timor and Indonesian income tax liabilities covering the period
1992 through 2000. Subsequent to the tax settlement discussed above, we determined that the accrual
was no longer necessary and wrote off the accrued liability in the fourth quarter of 2005. 14. Employee Benefit Plans Defined Contribution Plans We maintain defined contribution retirement plans for our U.S., U.K. and third-country
national, or TCN, employees. The plan for our U.S. employees, or the 401k Plan, is designed to
qualify under Section 401k of the Code. Under the 401k Plan, each participant may elect to defer
taxation on a portion of his or her eligible earnings, as defined by the 401k Plan, by directing
his or her employer to withhold a percentage of such earnings. A participating employee may also
elect to make after-tax contributions to the 401k Plan. We contribute 375% of a participants
defined compensation and match 25% of the first 6% of each employees compensation contributed to
the 401k Plan. Participants are fully vested immediately upon enrollment in the 401k Plan. For
the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, our provision for contributions was $73million 69million and $69million, respectively. The defined contribution retirement plan for our U.K. employees, or U.K. Plan, provides that
we make annual contributions in an amount equal to the employees contributions, generally up to a
maximum of 525% of the employees defined compensation per year. Our provision for contributions
was $08million for the year ended December31, 2005 and $07million for each of the years ended
December31, 2004 and 2003. The defined contribution retirement plan for our TCN employees, or TCN Plan, is similar to the
401k Plan. We contribute 375% of a participants defined compensation and match 25% of the first
6% of each employees compensation contributed to the TCN Plan. Our provision for contributions
was $08million for the year ended December31, 2005 and $07million for each of the years ended
December31, 2004 and 2003. Deferred Compensation and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan We established our Deferred Compensation and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, or
Supplemental Plan, in December1996. Participants in the Supplemental Plan are a select group of
our management or other highly compensated employees. We contribute to the Supplemental Plan any
portion of the 375% base salary 76 Table of Contents contribution and the matching contribution under our 401k Plan that cannot be contributed to
that plan because of limitations within the Code. The Supplemental Plan also provides that
participants may defer up to 10% of their base compensation and/or up to 100% of any performance
bonus. Each participant is fully vested in all amounts paid into the Supplemental Plan. Our
provision for contributions for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was not material. Pension Plan The defined benefit pension plan established by Arethusa effective October1, 1992 was frozen
on April30, 1996. At that date all participants were deemed fully vested in the plan, which
covered substantially all U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents who were employed by Arethusa.
Benefits are calculated and paid based on an employees years of credited service and average
compensation at the date the plan was frozen using an excess benefit formula integrated with social
security covered compensation. Pension costs are determined actuarially and at a minimum funded as required by the Code.
During each of the years 2005 and 2004, we made voluntary contributions to the plan of $02
million. As a result of freezing the plan, no service cost has been accrued for the years
presented. We use a September30 measurement date for the plan. The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets and
funded status of the plan

The long-term rate of return for plan assets is determined based on widely accepted
capital market principles, long-term return analysis for global fixed income and equity markets as
well as the active total return oriented portfolio management style. Long-term trends are
evaluated relative to current market factors such as inflation, interest rates and fiscal and
monetary policies, in order to assess the capital market assumptions as applied to the plan.
Consideration of diversification needs and rebalancing is maintained. Components of net periodic benefit costs were as follows

We employ a total return approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments
are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. The intent
of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over the long run.
Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of the plan liabilities, plan funded
status and corporate financial conditions. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend
of U.S. and non-U.S. fixed income and equity investments. Alternative investments, including hedge
funds, may be used judiciously to enhance risk adjusted long-term returns while improving portfolio
diversification. Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely
manner. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability
measurements, periodic asset/liability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews. 78 Table of Contents The plan assets at September30, 2005 and 2004 do not include any of our own securities. The benefits expected to be paid by the pension plan by fiscal year are

Coast and Gulf of Mexico. In late August2005, one of our jack-up drilling rigs, the Ocean
Warwick, was seriously damaged during Hurricane Katrina and other rigs in our fleet sustained
lesser damage in Hurricane Katrina or Rita, or in some cases from both storms. We believe that the
physical damage to our rigs, as well as related removal and recovery costs, are covered by
insurance, after applicable deductibles. The Ocean Warwick, with a net book value of $140million, was declared a constructive total
loss effective August29, 2005. We issued a proof of loss in the amount of $505million to our
insurers, representing the insured value of the rig less a $45million deductible, and we received
all insurance proceeds related to this claim in 2005. Recovery and removal of the Ocean Warwick
are subject to separate insurance deductibles totaling $25million. In the third quarter of 2005, we recorded a $336million, pre-tax, net casualty gain for the
Ocean Warwick, representing net insurance proceeds of $505million, less the write-off of the
$140million net carrying value of the drilling rig and $04million in rig-based inventory, and
$25million in insurance deductibles for salvage and wreck removal as a result of Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita. We have presented this as Casualty Gain on Ocean Warwick in our Consolidated
Statements of Operations for the year ended December31, 2005. Damage to our other affected rigs and warehouse in New Iberia, Louisiana was less severe, and
we believe that repair costs for such damage and lost equipment will be covered by insurance, less
estimated deductibles. Insurance deductibles relating to the remaining rigs damaged during
Hurricane Katrina and our rigs and facility damaged by Hurricane Rita total $26million in the
aggregate, of which $12million and $14million have been recorded as additional contract
drilling expense and loss on disposition of assets, respectively, for the year ended December31,
2005 in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. In addition, in the third quarter of 2005, we wrote-off the net book value of approximately
$42million, pre-tax, in rig equipment that was either lost or damaged beyond repair during these
storms as loss on disposition of assets and recorded a corresponding insurance receivable in an
amount equal to our expected recovery from insurers. The write-off of this equipment and
recognition of insurance receivables had no net effect on our consolidated results of operations
for the year ended December31, 2005. During the third and fourth quarters of 2005, we incurred additional operating expenses,
including but not limited to the cost of rig crew over-time and employee assistance, hurricane
relief supplies, temporary housing and office space and the rental of mooring equipment, of $51
million, pre-tax, relating to relief and recovery efforts in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina
and Rita, which we do not expect to be recoverable through our insurance.
2004 Storm During the third quarter of 2004, our operations in the Gulf of Mexico were impacted by
Hurricane Ivan, resulting in damage to several of our rigs. During 2004, we recorded an insurance
deductible of $61million related 79 Table of Contents to damage from this hurricane of which $45million and $16million were recorded as
additional contract drilling expense and loss on disposition of assets, respectively. Our insurance claim relating to damages sustained during Hurricane Ivan was settled in the
fourth quarter of 2005, resulting in net insurance proceeds to us of $145million. We recognized
an insurance gain of $56million as Gain on disposition of assets in our Consolidated Statements
of Operations for the year ended December31, 2005, resulting from the involuntary conversion of
assets lost during the hurricane in 2004. We accounted for the remaining portion of the insurance
proceeds as a reduction in an insurance receivable for hurricane-related repair costs which we
believed were reimbursable by insurance. In addition in the fourth quarter of 2005 we received $24million from a customer related to
equipment damaged on one of our high-specification rigs during Hurricane Ivan. We recorded $20
million of this recovery as a credit to contract drilling expense and $04million as a gain on
disposition of assets. 16. Segments and Geographic Area Analysis We manage our business on the basis of one reportable segment, contract drilling of offshore
oil and gas wells. Although we provide contract drilling services with different types of offshore
drilling rigs and also provide such services in many geographic locations, we have aggregated these
operations into one reportable segment based on the similarity of economic characteristics among
all divisions and locations, including the nature of services provided and the type of customers of
such services.

Geographic Areas At December31, 2005, we had drilling rigs located offshore nine countries other than the
United States. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of changes in social, political and
economic conditions inherent in foreign operations and our results of operations and the value of
our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Revenues by
geographic area are presented by attributing revenues to the individual country where the services
were performed. 80 Table of Contents

Item5. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures which are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the federal
securities laws, including this report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely
basis. These disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us under the federal securities laws is accumulated
and communicated to our management on a timely basis to allow decisions regarding required
disclosure. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated our disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e as of December
31, 2005 and concluded that our controls and procedures were effective.
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f for Diamond Offshore
Drilling, Inc. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our
management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published
financial statements. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any control system, however well
designed, including the possibility of human error and the possible circumvention or overriding of
controls. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Management
must make judgments with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of any specific control
measure. The design of a control system also is based in part upon assumptions and judgments made
by management about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that a control
will be effective under all potential future conditions. As a result, even an effective system of
internal controls can provide no more than reasonable assurance with respect to the fair
presentation of financial statements and the processes under which they were prepared. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2005. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSOin Internal Control 
Integrated Framework. Based on managements assessment our management believes that, as of December
31, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. Deloitte Touche LLP, the registered public accounting firm that audited our financial
statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on
managements assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. The attestation report of
Deloitte Touche LLP is included at the beginning of Item8 of this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in
connection with the foregoing evaluation that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting. 83 Table of Contents
