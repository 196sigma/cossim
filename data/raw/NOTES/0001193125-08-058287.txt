iGATE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006  1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies a
Nature of Business iGATE Corporation the Company is a worldwide provider of information technology IT and
offshore outsourcing services to large and medium-sized organizations. b Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company accounts for investments in businesses in which it owns between 20% and 50% of equity or otherwise acquires management influence using the equity method as prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. Investments in which the Company acquires less than a 20% interest, or in which the Company does not acquire management
influence, are accounted for using the cost method of accounting or, if publicly traded, as available-for-sale securities. c Uses of
Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. d Reclassifications Certain amounts in previously issued financial statements were reclassified to conform to 2007 presentations. e Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash
and cash equivalents are defined as cash and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market value. f Short-Term Investments Short-term investments consist of money market funds and are stated at market which approximates fair value. g Accounts
Receivable and Unbilled Receivables The Company extends credit to clients based upon managements assessment of their
creditworthiness. Substantially all of the Companys revenues and the resulting accounts receivable are from Global 2000 companies, major systems integrators and governmental agencies. Unbilled receivables represent amounts recognized as revenues for the periods presented based on services performed in accordance with the terms of
client contracts that will be invoiced in subsequent periods. 
44 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued AS OF DECEMBER
31, 2007 AND 2006 
h Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Accounts receivables are reviewed periodically to determine the probability of loss. The allowance for uncollectible accounts is determined using the
combination of the specific identification method for balances deemed uncollectible, as well as judgments made by the Company based upon historical and expected charge-off experience. i Employee Advances Employees can
be advanced up to $2,500 at the discretion of the Company. Normally, advances are based upon financial need at date of hire. Advances are deducted from the employees salary over a six-month period or until paid in full. j Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates The Company accounts for its investments in marketable equity securities in accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities SFAS 115. If at any time the Company has investments in marketable equity securities, they are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value, utilizing the investments closing price at each reporting
period. These investments are recorded on the balance sheet at market value, with the unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of Shareholders
Equity and Comprehensive Income Loss. The unrealized gain or loss is the difference between the Companys original cost for an investment and the investments fair value at each reporting period. Realized gains or losses on securities
sold are calculated using the specific identification method. If management determines that an investment in available for sale securities
has sustained an other-than-temporary decline in its value, the investment is written down to its fair value, by a charge to earnings. Such evaluation is dependent on the specific facts and circumstances. Factors that are considered by the Company
in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred include: the market value of the security in relation to its cost basis; the financial condition of the investee; and the intent and ability to retain the investment for a
sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment. In evaluating these factors above, management
presumes a decline in value to be other-than-temporary if the market price of the security is 20% or more below the investments cost basis for a period of six months or more the 20% criteria. However, the presumption of an
other-than-temporary decline in these instances may be overcome if there is persuasive evidence indicating that the decline is temporary in nature e.g., strong operating performance of investee, historical volatility of investee, etc.
Additionally, there may be instances where impairment losses are recognized even if the 20% criteria is not satisfied e.g., plan to sell the security in the near term and the fair value is below the Companys cost basis. No such impairment
losses were incurred in 2007 or 2006 or 2005. For investments accounted for using the cost or equity method of accounting, management
evaluates information e.g., budgets, business plans, financial statements, etc. in addition to quoted market price, if any, in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in value exists. Factors indicative of an other-than-temporary
decline include recurring operating losses, credit defaults and subsequent rounds of financings at an amount below the cost basis of an investment. This list is not all inclusive and management weighs all quantitative factors in determining if an
other-than-temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred. In 2007, the Company recorded an impairment of its remaining investment in Concours, Inc. of $06 million. In 2005, the Company recorded an impairment of $25 million on its
investment in Concours, Inc. There were no impairments recorded in 2006.

k Land, Building, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements Property and equipment are stated at cost. The Company provides for depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. Upon
disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the Companys accounts and the resulting gains and losses are reflected in loss from operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Repairs and maintenance are
charged to expense as incurred. Improvement and betterments that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. The estimated useful
lives of depreciable assets are as follows:  Building
25 years
Laptop Computers
18 months
Equipment
35 years
Leasehold Improvements
Shorter of the life of the improvement or lease term ranging from 3 to 10 years
Depreciation and amortization expense related to fixed assets amounted to $101 million, $92
million, and $86 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. l Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the value of the net assets acquired but will be subject to an annual impairment assessment of their
carrying value, or more frequently if circumstances change. Under SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized but are subject to, at a minimum, an annual
impairment assessment of their carrying value. Under SFAS 142, goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Estimated fair values of reporting units underlying the segments were
estimated using either a discounted cash flow methodology, recent comparable transactions or a combination thereof. For further discussions, see Note 5. The cost of other acquired intangibles is amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives of intangible assets are as follows:  Intellectual property
35years
Customer relationships
36 years
Beneficial employment contracts
24 years
The Company assesses the carrying value of its long-lived assets, including land, building,
equipment and leasehold improvement and amortizable intangible assets, whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets are considered to be impaired when
the sum of the undiscounted expected future net operating cash flows is less than the carrying values of the related assets. m Income
Taxes Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the
Companys assets and liabilities. The Company has evaluated its deferred tax asset and has recorded a valuation allowance where appropriate.

Historically, the government of India has provided incentives, in the form of tax holidays, to
encourage foreign investment. Under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961, the Companys Indian subsidiary is eligible to claim a tax holiday for 10 consecutive assessment years on profits derived from the export of software services from divisions
registered under the Software Technology Parks at Bangalore, Chennai and Pune. The benefits of the holiday began to expire for certain of the units in 2005. The Company has not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes or foreign withholding tax on basis differences in its non-U.S. subsidiaries of $125 million that result primarily from undistributed earnings the Company
intends to reinvest indefinitely. Determination of the deferred income tax liability on these basis differences is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs. n Minority Interest Minority
interest represents the proportionate share of outside equity holders. At December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had outside equity holders for the following Companies:  PercentageOutsideOwnership 2007 2006 iGATE Global Solutions Ltd. iGS
66 182 iGATE Clinical Research International Private Ltd. ICRI
5 5 LoanPro
0 490 iGS is a publicly held Company in India. On November13, 2007, the iGS shareholders approved
the delisting of iGS from the Bombay Stock Exchange, the National Stock Exchange, and the Bangalore Stock Exchange. The delisting was consummated on February4, 2008. o Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate that fair value: Cash and short-term investmentsThe carrying amount approximates market value. Accounts receivableThe carrying amount approximates market. Revolving credit facilityThe carrying amount approximates market value. The outstanding balance is reflected at its outstanding face value, excluding unpaid accrued interest at an interest rate range,
dependent upon the level of borrowings, at the lesser of the current LIBOR rate +100% to +250% or the Prime rate +050%, calculated on a per annum basis. Accounts payableThe carrying amount approximates market. p Derivatives Instruments and
Hedging Activities The Company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging currency, price, and interest rate
exposures, which exist as part of ongoing business operations. The Company carries derivative instruments 
47 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued AS OF DECEMBER
31, 2007 AND 2006 
on the balance sheet at fair value, determined by reference to quoted market prices. Derivatives are included in other assets and other liabilities based on
the instruments fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the reason for holding it. The cash flows
related to derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within operating activities as a component of other items, net. The Company recorded $24 million in other income in 2007 and $15 million in other expense in 2006 related to its foreign currency hedging transactions. q Stock-Based Employee Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based awards, using a fair value approach as prescribed in SFAS No123R Share Based Payments. The impact is more fully described in Note 11 Stock Based Compensation.
r Currency Translation Adjustment For all significant foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Statement of Operations
accounts are translated at the average exchange rate prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of other comprehensive loss. Gain and losses
from foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense, net for the periods presented. Foreign exchange gains or losses
on intercompany loans from the Company to its operating subsidiaries are recorded as a component of other income if payment is expected in the foreseeable future based upon mutually agreed upon payment terms. s Revenue Recognition The Company
recognizes revenue on time-and-materials contracts as the services are performed. Revenue is earned when the Companys consultants are working on projects. Revenue recognition is negatively impacted by national holidays and consultant vacation
and sick days. Revenues on fixed-price contracts are recognized using the proportional performance method. Performance is determined by relating the actual cost of work performed to date to the estimated total cost for each contract and revenue is
recognized based upon costs incurred by the Companys consultants during the period. The Company follows this revenue recognition method for fixed-price contracts because there is a direct and consistent relationship between the service
patterns and services provided to the customer and the direct costs incurred to provide such services. If the Companys cost estimates indicate a loss on a particular fixed-price contract, we record a provision for the estimated loss without
regard to the stage of completion. Changes in job performance, conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which the changes are identified. Contracts with deliverables or
project milestones recognize revenue as the deliverables or project milestones are achieved. Contracts with deliverables or project milestones can provide for certain penalties if the deliverables or project milestones are not met within contract
timelines. Certain maintenance type contracts with no stated deliverables, with a designated workforce assigned, recognize revenues on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, which are typically one year in duration. Revenue on these
contracts is ratable and predetermined based upon the negotiated contract.

31, 2007 AND 2006 
In certain client situations, where the nature of the engagement requires it, we utilize the services
of other companies in our industry. If these services are provided under an arrangement whereby we agree to retain only a fixed portion of the amount billed to the client to cover our management and administrative costs, we classify the amount
billed to the client as subcontractor revenue. These revenues, however, are recorded on a gross versus net basis because we retain credit risk and are the primary obligor to our client. All revenue derived from services provided by our employees or
other independent contractors who work directly for us are recorded as direct revenue. t Software Implementation Costs
The Company accounts for costs incurred for its own information systems upgrades in accordance with Statement of Position 98-1 SOP
98-1 Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. SOP 98-1 requires that both internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage should be charged to operations as
incurred. Such costs incurred during the application development stage should be capitalized; training costs incurred in this stage should, however, be expensed. Costs of upgrades and enhancements should be capitalized but only during the
application development stage if it is probable that the expenditures will result in added functionality for the software. During the post-implementation/operation stage, training costs both internal and external and maintenance costs should be
charged to operations. u Issuance of Stock by Subsidiaries All issuances of subsidiary stock options or restricted stock and stock compensation expense recorded in accordance with SFAS 123R are treated as equity
transactions. v Acquisitions The Companys acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method. The purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair market values. Any excess purchase price over the fair
market value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. For all acquisitions, operating results are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations since the dates of the acquisitions. See Note 12 for additional information.
w Income Tax Uncertainties In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement 109 FIN 48. This
statement clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the tax benefits of that position to be recognized in a companys financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold of
more-likely-than-not, and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on
January1, 2007. There was no material effect on the financial statements. The Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to retained deficit of $06 million related to adopting FIN 48. Also, certain amounts were reclassified in the

Credit Facilities On August22, 2007, the
Company renewed its credit facility Renewed Facility with PNC Bank N.A. PNC. The Renewed Facility provides a maximum loan amount of $350 million and is unsecured. The provisions of the Renewed Facility requires the
Company to maintain domestic cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of at least $350 million, maintain net tangible worth of at least $1000 million and maintain a liquidity ratio of not less than 15 to 10. The liquidity ratio is

transferred cash from the USA to India for the repurchase of shares from the public shareholders of iGS. This transfer of cash resulted in a violation of a financial covenant under the PNC Facility. The Company was granted a waiver by PNC and the
current waiver extends through March31, 2008. The Company expects to modify certain covenants in the Renewed Facility in connection with the divestiture of iPS. The Company had no outstanding borrowings against the Renewed Facility as of

Other Commitments We have plans for a Phase IV expansion of our campus located in Bangalore, India. Total estimated costs of the project will approximate $25 million and
will be paid out over the next 30 months. Phase I was completed in February 2004, Phase II was completed in December 2005 and Phase III was completed in January 2007. We have funded entire the project to date through a combination of available cash
reserves and short-term investments and expect to fund the costs of Phase IV through our net cash flows provided by operations. In order
to complete the delisting of iGS from the public stock exchanges in India and to complete the repurchase of all shares associated with this transaction, the Company will use approximately $300 million in cash in 2008 for this specific purpose. The
Company will fund all monies through a combination of existing cash reserves and short term investments. As part of the Companys
acquisition of a 95% interest in ICRI, the Company may be required to fund their existing operations for an amount up to $30 million, based upon mutually agreed upon operating needs. The Company funded $09 million, $05 million and $03 million in
2007, 2006 and 2005 respectively, and may be required to fund ICRI operations in 2008 and in subsequent years.  9.
Contingencies In the ordinary course of our
business, the Company is involved in a number of lawsuits and administrative proceedings. While uncertainties are inherent in the final outcome of these matters, Company management believes, after consultation with legal counsel, that the
disposition of these proceedings should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. iGS has entered in to a service agreement with a customer that provides the customer the option to take an equity stake in iGS for up to 5% of iGSs outstanding voting shares. The customer may purchase iGS shares solely at their
discretion and must notify iGS of their intention to purchase within thirty days of the purchase.  10.
Employee Benefit Plan The Company has an Employee
Retirement Savings Plan the Retirement Plan under Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code that covers substantially all U.S. based salaried employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 15% of eligible compensation,
subject to limits in the Internal Revenue Code. The Retirement Plan does not provide for any Company matching contributions.  11.
Stock Based Compensation iGS/iGATE Exchange
Options Consequent to the delisting of iGS from the Indian stock exchanges, iGS exchanged 23million of iGS employee stock
options for 28million of iGATE stock options on December7, 2007. The exchange was not mandatory and was solely the prerogative of each employee. All iGS stock options were time based vesting and none of them had any performance
conditions and similarly all iGATE options granted in exchange had only time based service conditions for vesting. The exchange ratio was
computed as 1202 iGATE options for every iGS option. This was arrived considering a price of approximately $1040 for each for iGS option, and $866 for iGATE shares, the closing price of the Companys stock on December7, 2007.
58 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued AS OF DECEMBER
31, 2007 AND 2006 
The iGATE options issued are replacement awards for original iGS options, and as such, are treated as
modification in accordance with SFAS No123R. Hence, the fair value of the exchange options was estimated at the date of exchange and the incremental fair value of $05 million will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite
service periods of the awards. The Company also paid $83 million towards redemption of iGS vested options at their fair market values.
The amount was recorded as a reduction of Additional Paid-in Capital in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity and Comprehensive Income Loss. Purusant to the delisting of iGS from the Indian stock exchanges and the exchange of iGS stock options with iGATE options, no further options will be granted under any of the iGS stock option plans. iGATE Corporation Stock Option Plans Stock
Based Compensation In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No123R,
which requires compensation costs related to share-based transactions, including employee share options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value. SFAS No123R revised SFAS No123, as amended, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Effective
January1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No123R using the modified prospective transition method. Under this transition method, the compensation cost recognized beginning January1, 2006 includes compensation
cost for iall share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No123, and iiall share-based
payments granted subsequent to December31, 2005 based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No123R. Compensation cost is generally recognized ratably over the requisite service period or the
retirement date for retirement eligible employees, if earlier. Prior period amounts have not been restated. As a result of the adoption of
SFAS No123R, the Companys results for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 include share-based compensation expense of $44 million and $40 million, respectively. The total stock-based compensation cost included in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations within direct costs for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 was $19 million and $18 million, respectively. The total stock-based compensation cost included in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations within selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 was $25 million and $22 million, respectively. The Company has recognized a related tax benefit associated with its share-based
compensation arrangements for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 of $02 million and $01 million, respectively.

Prior to January1, 2006, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation plans in accordance
with the provisions of APB Opinion No25, as permitted by SFAS No123, and accordingly did not recognize compensation expense for the issuance of options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price at the date of
grant. The Company did recognize $08 million of compensation expense for the year ended December31, 2005 related to a restricted stock grant and discounted stock options. Had the fair value based method as prescribed by SFAS No123 been

11,127,036 During 2007 and 2006, the Company granted 01million and 06million shares of
performance based restricted stock, respectively. Each share is earned only after certain financial targets are met. Each performance target is assessed yearly over a four year to five year period, at which time the shares will be awarded upon
achievement of the yearly target. If the performance targets are not met, the shares that were to be awarded for the performance year will be cancelled. If the performance target is achieved, the shares are issued to the recipient. These shares are
voting but are subject to forfeiture if performance targets are not achieved or in the event of termination. During 2007, 2006 and 2005,
options covering a total of 02million shares, 01million shares and 02million shares, respectively, of Common Stock were granted under the Plan. On December7, 2007, 28million iGATE stock options were exchanged for
23million of iGS stock options. Options generally expire ten years from the date of the original grant or earlier if an option holder ceases to be employed or associated by the Company for any reason. Compensation expense associated with the performance based grants that continue to vest based upon future performance is measured based on the grant-date
fair value of iGATE common stock. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the performance period based upon the Companys estimated achievement of the established performance criteria. Compensation expense is only recognized for those
awards that are expected to vest, which is estimated based upon the assessment of both the probability that the performance criteria will be achieved and current period and historical forfeitures. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $29 million, $06 million and $02 million, respectively. The fair value
of stock options vested during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $16 million, $08 million and $11 million, respectively. The income tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $02 million, $01 million and less than $01
million, respectively. In 2007, the Company recognized $16 million of compensation expense associated with the iGATE stock incentive plan
in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations compared to $09 million in 2006. As of December31, 2007, approximately $150 million of unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized for the unvested shares.
This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 21 years.

280  iGS also maintains an employee restricted stock unit plan herein referred to as RSU
Plan. The RSU Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee appointed by the Board of Directors of iGS. The RSU Plan is a separate plan set up in partial modification of the above iGS Plans and provides for the issuance of a maximum of
30million shares of iGS common stock. These restricted stock units are granted at a $008 strike price. Restricted stock unit
grants for the RSU Plan generally vest over a four year period and expire twelve years from the date of grant or earlier if a holder ceases to be employed by or associated with iGS for any reason. On October10, 2006, iGS exchanged approximately 175million of iGS employee stock options for approximately 05million of iGS
restricted stock units. The proposed exchange was approved by iGSs Board on October10, 2006. The exchange was not mandatory and was solely the prerogative of each employee. At the date of the exchange the iGS closing stock price was
$420. The fair value of restricted stock unit grants was estimated using the prevailing market value of iGS common stock at the date of
grant. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. A forfeiture rate is also applied to the estimated compensation cost of the granted restricted
stock units. Forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior, as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures.

18,048 371 The fair value of each option grant under the iGATE Plans and iGS Plans was estimated using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to 
66 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued AS OF DECEMBER
31, 2007 AND 2006 
make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of either the iGATE or
iGS common stock and implied volatility derived from exchange traded options. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option and expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free
interest rate for each of the iGATE Plans was based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The risk-free rate for each of the iGS Plans was based on an equivalent Indian
risk-free rate. Forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior, as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures. The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:  Year Ended December31, 2007

Acquisitions The following paragraphs describe
each of the acquisitions made by the Company during 2007, 2006 and 2005. Descriptions regarding each acquisition will vary dependent upon the complexity of the transaction and materiality and are presented in chronological order. Unless otherwise
noted, pro-forma disclosure regarding these purchases have not been provided because they are not material to the operations of the Company. The Company has calculated each purchase price allocation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No141, Business Combinations. All amortizable intangible assets acquired consist of intellectual
property, beneficial employment contracts and customer relationships. Please refer to Note 5 for information pertaining to amortization expense. In 2007, the Company, being the largest shareholder in iGS, decided to delist iGS from the Indian stock exchanges. As per the delisting guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, iGS could be delisted only after iGATE and its
affiliates acquired over 90% of iGS common stock. The Company increased its ownership to 934% as of December31, 2007 by acquiring 40million shares representing 1265% of iGS outstanding shares from the Indian public at a cost of
$422 million at a price of approximately $1040 per share. 
67 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued AS OF DECEMBER
31, 2007 AND 2006 
The Company paid the investment banking firm who managed the delisting exercise a fee of $05
million, making the total purchase consideration to $427 million as of December31, 2007. The minority interest in the books have been accordingly adjusted by $124 million for the 1265% stake purchased and the excess purchase price has been
recognized in the books. The Company is currently in the process of finalizing the allocation of the excess purchase price. Management is
currently evaluating third party appraisals obtained and working on acquiring the remaining outstanding minority shares. Based upon preliminary valuations and the current shares redeemed, the excess purchase price will be allocated to land and
buildings of $39 million and to goodwill and customer contracts of $264 million. On April24, 2006, iGS entered into a Master
Services Agreement with LoanPro, LLC LoanPro to perform offshore mortgage servicing. In conjunction with this agreement, iGS acquired a 5% ownership interest in LoanPro for a nominal amount with the option to acquire up to an
additional 55%. iGS exercised this option on July1, 2006 and acquired the additional 55% of LoanPro for a nominal amount. In the third quarter of 2006, iGS consolidated LoanPros operations into the iGATE Solutions segment. iGS has loaned
$11 million to LoanPro as of February28, 2007. The loan pays 6% interest and is due in 2009. Assets acquired were insignificant and did not require a purchase price allocation. Proforma disclosure was also not required due to immateriality.
During the fourth quarter of 2005, iGS purchased the remaining 51% interest of CIBER, India Pvt. Ltd., CIBER, an India-based
joint venture originally started in 2003 by Ciber, Inc. and iGS, for a nominal amount. The acquisition was deemed to be immaterial not requiring pro-forma disclosure. Assets acquired were insignificant and did not require a purchase price
allocation.  13.

adverse tax effects to be considered from the goodwill impairment discussed in Note 5 above as it is included as part of the subsidiarys tax holiday. Non-operating income, such as interest income and capital gains, is not part of the tax
holiday, and has been considered as part of our income tax provision.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and
Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of Company
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15b and 15d-15b. Based upon, and as of the date of this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were
effective. The results of managements assessment were reviewed with the Companys Audit Committee. The certification required
by Section302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as exhibits 3101 and 3102, respectively, to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S.A. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with established policies or
procedures may deteriorate. The Companys management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007. In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria described in the
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based upon this assessment, management believes that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2007. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm, BDO Seidman, LLP, has issued its report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in iGATEs internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, such internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Board of
Directors and Shareholders iGATE Corporation Pittsburgh, PA
We have audited iGATE Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. iGATE Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item9A, Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, iGATE Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of iGATE Corporation as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007 and our report dated March17, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ BDO Seidman, LLP Milwaukee, WI March17, 2008
