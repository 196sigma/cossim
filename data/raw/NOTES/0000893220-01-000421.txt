INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Board of Directors
and Shareholders of VerticalNet, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
VerticalNet, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the
related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, shareholders' equity
deficit and other comprehensive loss for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2000. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of VerticalNet,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
DESCRIPTION OF COMPANY
During the year ended December 31, 2000, VerticalNet, Inc. VerticalNet
or referred to as we, us and other similar expressions, through its
subsidiaries, provides end-to-end e-commerce solutions targeted at distinct
business segments through three strategic business units   - VerticalNet Markets operates 59 industry-specific e-marketplaces through
which we provide hosted e-commerce and community capabilities for
corporate divisions and small and medium sized businesses.
- VerticalNet Solutions offers software solutions to industry alliances,
independent net market makers and global 2000 enterprises.
- VerticalNet Exchanges focused on trading electronic components and
hardware in open and spot markets.
On December 19, 2000, we entered into an agreement to sell our VerticalNet
Exchanges business unit. Therefore, the operating results of this unit have been
reflected as a discontinued operation. Additionally, the net assets of this unit
are reflected as net assets of discontinued operations see Note 4.
VerticalNet was founded on July 28, 1995 and completed its initial public
offering the IPO of 16,100,000 shares of its common stock at $400 per share
on a post-split basis on February 17, 1999. Net proceeds were approximately
$583 million net of underwriters' commissions and offering expenses of $61
million.
As we continue to grow, we expect to utilize cash resources to fund
operating losses, acquisitions, strategic investments, technologies and the
infrastructure necessary to support our growth. Additionally, we expect that our
acquisitions will have a negative impact on our liquidity and cash flow in the
near term as we integrate acquired businesses with ours. We believe that our
current level of liquid assets and the expected cash flows from contractual
arrangements will be sufficient to finance our capital requirements and
anticipated operating losses for at least the next 12 months. However, to the
extent our current level of liquid assets proves to be insufficient, we may need
to obtain additional debt or equity financing. Our contractual arrangements
include a three-year software licensing and professional services agreement with
Converge, Inc. see Note 21 and a commercial arrangement with Microsoft see
Note 9. Additionally, we may, if the capital markets present attractive
opportunities, raise cash through the sale of debt or equity. We can provide no
assurance that our liquid assets will be sufficient to fund our operations or
that we will be successful in obtaining any required or desired financing either
on acceptable terms or at all.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Our consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of
our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
VerticalNet ownership of VerticalNet Europe B.V. VerticalNet Europe
increased from 56% to 72% on December 29, 2000 when VerticalNet Europe redeemed
some of its shares held by British Telecommunications, plc BT. Due to
minority shareholder governance provisions in the original agreement, we
previously were accounting for VerticalNet Europe using the equity method. As a
result of our increased ownership, certain governance provisions regarding
minority shareholders were amended, giving us control over VerticalNet Europe
operations. Accordingly, we have consolidated VerticalNet Europe in our
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2000 and will begin consolidating
VerticalNet Europe operations starting January 1, 2001.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Subsequent to management decision to sell the VerticalNet Exchanges
segment, the majority of our fiscal 2000 revenue was generated from two primary
sources attributable to our VerticalNet Markets segment: e-enablement and
e-commerce; and advertising and services. For the year ended December 31, 2000,
approximately $79 million of revenue was generated from software licensing,
related professional services and other business operations services.
E-enablement and e-commerce revenues include storefront and e-commerce
center fees, Web site development fees and e-commerce fees. Storefront and
e-commerce center fees are recognized ratably over the period of the contract.
Web site development fees are recognized as the services are performed.
E-commerce fees in the form of transaction fees, percentage of sale fees or
minimum guaranteed fees, are recognized upon receipt of payment. E-commerce fees
from educational courses are recognized in the period in which the course is
completed. E-commerce fees from books and other product sales are recognized in
the period in which the products are shipped. Auction transaction fees are
recognized when the auction is successfully concluded.
Advertising and services revenues, including buttons and banners, are
recognized ratably over the period of the applicable contract. Newsletter
sponsorship revenues are recognized when the newsletters are e-mailed.
Advertising contracts generally do not extend beyond one year, although certain
contracts are for multiple years. We also enter into strategic co-marketing
agreements under which we develop co-branded sites. Revenues from hosting and
maintenance services under these co-marketing arrangements are recognized
ratably over the term of the contract. In the normal course of business, we
enter into multiple-element arrangements. We allocate revenue under such
arrangements based on the fair value of each element to the extent it is
objectively determinable, and recognize revenue upon delivery or consummation of
the separable earnings process attributable to each element.
Revenues from software licensing, related professional services and other
business operations services are generally accounted for under Statement of
Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, and related guidance in the
form of technical questions and answers published by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants' task force on software revenue recognition. SOP
97-2 requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple
elements to be allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective
evidence of fair values of the elements. License revenue allocated to software
products generally is recognized upon delivery of the software products or
ratably over a contractual period if unspecified software products are to be
delivered during that period. Revenue allocated to hosting and maintenance
services is recognized ratably over the contract term and revenue allocated to
professional services is recognized as the services are performed. If the
professional services provided are essential to the functionality or are for
significant production, modification or customization of the software products,
both the software product revenue and service revenue are recognized in
accordance with the provisions of SOP 81-1, Accounting for Performance of
Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts. Under SOP 81-1,
revenues and costs are recognized based on the labor hours incurred to date,
compared to total estimated labor hours over the term of the contract using the
percentage of completion method.
At December 31, 2000 and 1999, approximately $42 million and $30 million
that is included in the respective accounts receivable balance was unbilled due
to customer payment terms.
Pursuant to the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF in Issue No. 99-17, Accounting for Barter Advertising Transactions,
barter transactions are recorded at the estimated fair value of the
advertisements given, based on recent historical cash transactions. Barter
revenue is recognized when the advertising impressions or other services are
delivered to the customer and advertising expense is recorded when the
advertising impressions or other services are received from the customer. If we
receive the advertising impressions or other services from the customer prior to
our delivery of the advertising impressions                     58
62
VERTICALNET, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
a liability is recorded, and if we deliver the advertising impressions to the
customer prior to receiving the advertising impressions or other services, a
prepaid expense is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. For the years
ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, we recognized approximately $94
million, $38 million and $07 million of advertising revenues, respectively,
and $77 million, $30 million and $05 million of advertising expenses,
respectively, from barter transactions. We have recorded approximately $23
million and $10 million in prepaid expenses related to barter transactions as
of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
EDITORIAL AND OPERATIONAL EXPENSES
Editorial and operational expenses consist primarily of salaries and
benefits of operating and editorial personnel, Internet connection charges,
depreciation, purchased content, product costs including costs of professional
services provided to customers and other related operating costs, which are
expensed as incurred.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
Product development costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits,
consulting and other related expenses, which are expensed as incurred.
ADVERTISING COSTS
We expense advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expenses, exclusive
of barter advertising discussed above, were approximately $324 million, $43
million and $19 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include cash, money market investments and other
highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less.
RESTRICTED CASH
Restricted cash represents certificates of deposit held pursuant to
building lease agreements and other financing arrangements. At December 31,
2000, we had approximately $79 million and $37 million of restricted cash
classified in current and non-current other assets, respectively, on the
consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 1999, we had approximately $12
million of restricted cash classified in non-current other assets.
INVESTMENTS
We account for debt securities and marketable equity securities in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. These
available-for-sale investments are classified as short-term and long-term
investments on the consolidated balance sheet and are reported at fair value,
with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in other comprehensive
income loss. Realized gains or losses and other than temporary declines in
fair value, if any, on available-for-sale securities are reported in other
income expense, as incurred.
We hold equity instruments of privately-held companies for business and
strategic purposes. These investments are included in other investments on the
consolidated balance sheet and are accounted for under the cost method since our
ownership percentage is less than 20% and we do not have the ability to exercise
significant influence over the investees. For the years ended December 31, 2000
and 1999, we recognized revenue of $53 million and $14 million, respectively,
from commercial arrangements with cost method investees. For these non-publicly
traded investments, our policy is to regularly review the market conditions
59
63
VERTICALNET, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
and the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying values.
We have investments in privately owned companies whose results are not
consolidated, but over whom we exercise significant influence. These investments
are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and included in other
investments on the consolidated balance sheet. Determining whether we exercise
significant influence with respect to a particular investment depends on an
evaluation of several factors including, among others, representation on the
investee board of directors, as well as our overall ownership level of the
investee, including voting rights associated with our holdings in common,
preferred and other convertible instruments in the investee. Under the equity
method of accounting, our share of the earnings or losses of the investee is
reflected in other income expense on our consolidated statement of operations.
Revenues earned from equity method companies are eliminated based on our
pro-rata ownership percentage.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated amortization
and depreciation. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis
over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows                              
Computer equipment and  15-5 years
Office equipment and  5-7 years
Trade show  7 years
Leasehold  3 years CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE
Under the provisions of SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, we capitalize costs associated
with internally developed and/or purchased software systems for new products and
enhancements to existing products that have reached the application development
stage and meet recoverability tests. Capitalized costs include external direct
costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining internal-use
software, payroll and payroll-related expenses for employees who are directly
associated with and devote time to the internal-use software project and
interest costs incurred, if material, while developing internal-use software.
Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is
complete and ceases no later than the point at which the project is
substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose. The carrying value of
the software is regularly reviewed and a loss is recognized if the value of the
estimated undiscounted cash flow benefits related to the asset falls below the
remaining unamortized cost. These capitalized costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the economic useful life, beginning when the asset is
ready for its intended use.
Under the provisions of SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed, certain development costs of
our software products are capitalized subsequent to the establishment of
technological feasibility and up to the time the product becomes available for
general release. Amortization is provided on a product-by-product basis on the
straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product.
Software costs capitalized under SOP 98-1 and SFAS No. 86 approximated $61
million and $10 million as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and are
included in property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet.
Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 was approximately $20
million. No amortization expense was recorded for the year ended December 31,
1999.

VERTICALNET, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
INTANGIBLE AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Goodwill is amortized using the straight-line method from the date of
acquisition over the period of the expected benefits, which is expected to be
three years. Other intangible assets resulting from acquisitions, including
covenants not-to-compete, acquired technology and acquired workforce, are also
amortized using the straight-line method from the date of acquisition over the
period of the expected benefits, ranging from two to three years.
We operate in an industry that is rapidly evolving and extremely
competitive. Recently, many Internet based businesses, including some within the
business-to-business e-commerce industry, have experienced difficulty in raising
additional capital necessary to fund operating losses and ongoing investments in
strategic relationships. Valuations of public companies operating in the
Internet business-to-business e-commerce sector have declined significantly
since the first quarter of 2000.
We regularly perform reviews to determine whether events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill and other
intangible assets may not be recoverable. We assess long-lived assets for
impairment under SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. During the year ended
December 31, 2000, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately
$115 million based on an analysis of projected undiscounted cash flows.
Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2000, we wrote off
approximately $56 million in obsolete software, prepaid assets and deferred
costs for terminated acquisitions. It is reasonably possible that our accounting
estimates with respect to the useful life and ultimate recoverability of
goodwill and other intangible assets could change in the near term and that the
effect of such changes on the consolidated financial statements could be
material. While we currently believe that the recorded amount of goodwill and
other intangible assets is not impaired, a significant write-down or write-off
may be required in the future.
DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS
Specific costs related to our convertible debt offering in September 1999
were capitalized upon issuance of the debt and are being amortized to interest
expense using the effective interest rate method over the five year term of the
debt. Upon conversion of $933 million of our convertible debt in April 2000,
approximately $29 million of debt issuance costs were written off against
additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2000, the remaining debt issuance
costs of $06 million are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance
sheet.
SELF INSURANCE
We are self-insured for certain losses related to employee medical benefits
as of December 31, 2000. We have purchased stop-loss coverage in order to limit
our exposure. Self insurance losses are accrued based on our estimates of the
aggregate liability for uninsured claims incurred using certain actuarial
assumptions followed in the insurance industry. At December 31, 2000 and 1999,
the accrued liability for self-insured losses is included in accrued expenses
and approximates $13 million and $02 million, respectively.
INCOME TAXES
We record income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax
effect of net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in the period that includes the
61
65
VERTICALNET, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if
it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.
STOCK OPTIONS
Stock-based employee compensation is recognized using the intrinsic value
method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. For disclosure purposes, pro forma net
loss and loss per share data are provided in accordance with SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as if the fair value method had been
applied.
STOCK SPLITS
On January 20, 2000 and July 21, 1999, our board of directors approved a
two-for-one stock split of our common stock effected on March 31, 2000 and
August 20, 1999, respectively.
All references in the consolidated financial statements to shares, share
prices and per share amounts have been adjusted retroactively for these splits.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS
We report comprehensive income or loss in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards
for reporting comprehensive income loss and its components in financial
statements. Comprehensive income or loss, as defined, includes all changes in
equity net assets during a period from non-owner sources.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
We translate the assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries into
U.S. dollars at the current rates of exchange in effect as of each balance sheet
date. Revenues and expenses are translated using average rates in effect during
the period. Gains and losses from translation adjustments are included in
accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet. Foreign
currency transaction gains or losses, are recognized in current operations and
have not been significant to our operating results in any period. The effect of
foreign currency rate changes on cash and cash equivalents has not been
significant in any period.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
In accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 107, Disclosures about Fair
Value of Financial Instruments, we have determined the estimated fair value of
our financial instruments using available market information and valuation
methodologies. Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents,
available-for-sale investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, capital
leases and convertible notes. Considerable judgment is required to develop the
estimates of fair value; thus, the estimates are not necessarily indicative of
the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange. However, we
believe the carrying values of these assets and liabilities, with the exception
of the convertible notes, is a reasonable estimate of their fair market values
at December 31, 2000 and 1999 due to the short maturities of such items. Based
on their quoted market value as of December 31, 2000, the convertible notes are
estimated to have an aggregate fair market value of approximately $115 million.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of
credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents in bank deposits
accounts, short-term investments and trade receivables. Cash and cash
equivalents are held with high quality financial institutions. Short-term
investments are primarily held in high quality corporate debt instruments and
government obligations. We periodically perform credit evaluations of
62
66
VERTICALNET, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
our customers and maintain reserves for potential losses. We do not anticipate
any losses from these receivables in excess of the provided allowances.
Microsoft accounted for approximately $305 million or 27% of total revenues for
the year ended December 31, 2000 and comprises 65% of our deferred revenue
balance as of December 31, 2000. No single customer accounted for greater than
10% of total revenues during the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998.
COMPUTATION OF HISTORICAL NET LOSS PER SHARE
Basic net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive net loss per share is
computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common
equivalent shares outstanding during the period, including incremental common
shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants using the
treasury stock method and the conversion of our 5 1/4% convertible subordinated
debentures and our Series A 600% convertible redeemable preferred stock using
the if-converted method. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the
calculation if their effect is anti-dilutive. Common stock issued upon the
conversion of the convertible notes given as consideration in connection with
the purchase of NECX.com LLC was included in the calculation from the date of
acquisition in December 1999 because the related securities were accounted for
as equity.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts referred to as derivatives,
and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS No. 137, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities -- Deferral of the Effective
Date of SFAS No. 133, and SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities -- an Amendment of SFAS No. 133, is
effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000.
We do not expect SFAS No. 133, as amended, to have a material impact on our
results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
The EITF has begun discussion on Issue No. 00-21, Accounting for
Multiple-Element Revenue Arrangements. Issues currently being addressed by an
EITF working group include: a determining when elements of multiple-element
arrangements should be evaluated separately; b allocation of consideration to
the individual elements; and c accounting for certain direct costs incurred
related to the arrangement. No consensuses have been reached yet on these
issues. However, because we engage in these types of transactions, we anticipate
that guidance ultimately issued by the EITF on this issue may impact us in the
future.
2 ACQUISITIONS
TRADEUM
On March 23, 2000, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
Tradeum, Inc. Tradeum for approximately $4531 million, including
transaction costs. The consideration included 2,573,837 shares of our common
stock, valued at approximately $3250 million and 1,426,148 employee options to
purchase our
63

VERTICALNET, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
common stock, valued as of the date of acquisition at approximately $1226
million, based on an independent valuation. A portion of the common stock given
as consideration was reduced by an illiquidity discount based on restrictions
detailed in the lock up agreements signed by the individuals receiving the
stock. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and the excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired of
approximately $4526 million was allocated to in-process research and
development, existing technology, assembled workforce and goodwill in the
amounts of approximately $100 million, $70 million, $10 million and $4346
million, respectively. The $100 million was charged to expense as a
non-recurring charge upon consummation of the acquisition since the in-process
research and development had not yet reached technological feasibility and had
no alternative future uses see Note 3. The existing technology, assembled
workforce and goodwill are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 36
months.
VERTICALNET EUROPE
In June 2000, we formed VerticalNet Europe, a joint venture with BT and
Internet Capital Group, Inc. ICG. The joint venture was funded with 1095
million Euros approximately $1147 million as of the closing date from the
three partners. We contributed to VerticalNet Europe approximately $68 million
in cash and intellectual property independently valued at approximately $1200
million for the operation of e-marketplaces within Europe for a 56% ownership
interest in VerticalNet Europe. Additionally, VerticalNet Europe and BT created
VerticalNet UK Ltd. as part of the joint venture agreement.
Our ownership of VerticalNet Europe increased from 56% to 72% on December
29, 2000 when VerticalNet Europe redeemed some of its shares held by BT. Due to
minority shareholder governance provisions in the original agreement, we were
previously accounting for VerticalNet Europe using the equity method. As a
result of our increased ownership, certain governance provisions regarding
minority shareholders were amended giving us control over VerticalNet Europe
operations. Accordingly, we have consolidated VerticalNet Europe in our
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2000 and will begin consolidating
VerticalNet Europe operations starting January 1, 2001. The increase in
ownership was accounted for as a purchase and the estimated excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired of approximately
$34 million was allocated to goodwill. Additionally, in December 2000,
VerticalNet Europe obtained full ownership of VerticalNet UK Ltd.
During the year ended December 31, 2000, we entered into a commercial
arrangement with BT under which we recognized approximately $40 million in
revenues. Also in a separate agreement, a BT affiliate agreed to license
VerticalNet Solutions' products for distribution in selected regions worldwide.
OTHER 2000 ACQUISITIONS
During the year ended December 31, 2000, we completed six additional
acquisitions, including Career Mag, Leasend, J.M. Computer Services, BidLine,
FedAmerica and Oralis. The aggregate purchase price of these acquisitions was
approximately $53 million in cash and 474,060 shares of common stock valued at
approximately $368 million. These acquisitions were accounted for as purchases
and the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired
of approximately $416 million was allocated to goodwill and other intangibles.
The results of operations from these acquisitions are not material to our
financial position or results of operations.
ISADRA
In August 1999, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Isadra,
Inc. Isadra for $24 million in cash, 2,000,000 shares of common stock
valued at approximately $378 million, based on an independent valuation, and
81,526 options to purchase our common stock, valued at approximately $15
million at the date of acquisition using the Black-Scholes model. The common
stock given as consideration was reduced by an illiquidity discount based on
restrictions detailed in the lock up agreements signed by the individuals
receiving the stock. In connection
64
68
VERTICALNET, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
with this transaction, we agreed to lend up to $10 million to Isadra prior to
the closing of this transaction. As of the acquisition date, we had advanced
Isadra approximately $10 million. The acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase and the estimated excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
the tangible net assets acquired of approximately $439 million was allocated to
in-process research and development, existing technology, assembled work force
and goodwill in the amounts of approximately $136 million, $21 million, $05
million and $277 million, respectively. The $136 million was charged to
expense as a non-recurring charge upon consummation of the acquisition since the
in-process research and development had not yet reached technological
feasibility and had no alternative future use see Note 3. The existing
technology and assembled work force are being amortized on a straight-line basis
over 24 months, while goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over
36 months.
OTHER 1999 ACQUISITIONS
During the year ended December 31, 1999, we completed nine additional
acquisitions, including Safety Online, Techspex, Oillink, ElectricNet, LabX
Technologies, Industry OnLine, CertiSource, GovCon and TextileWeb. The aggregate
purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately $39 million in cash and
781,488 shares of common stock valued at approximately $279 million. These
acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and the excess of the purchase
price over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired of approximately
$330 million was allocated to goodwill and other intangibles. The results of
operations from these acquisitions are not material to our financial position or
results of operations.
For all of the acquisitions described above, the results of the acquired
companies have been included in our financial statements from the date of
acquisition.

TRADEUM ACQUISITION
In connection with the acquisition of Tradeum, we allocated $100 million
of the purchase price to in-process research and development IPR. This
allocation represented the estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted cash
flows related to the incomplete research and development projects. At the date
of acquisition, the development of these projects had not yet reached
technological feasibility, and the research and development in progress had no
alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed as of the
acquisition date. At the acquisition date, Tradeum was conducting design,
development, engineering and
65

VERTICALNET, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
testing activities associated with the development of next-generation
technologies that were expected to address emerging market demands for
business-to-business e-commerce.
At the acquisition date, the technologies under development were between
20% and 25% complete, based on project man-months and costs. Tradeum had spent
approximately $11 million on the IPR projects, and expected to spend
approximately $39 million to complete the research and development.
In making the purchase price allocation, we considered present value
calculations of income, an analysis of project accomplishments and completion
costs, an assessment of overall contributions, as well as project risks. The
value assigned to IPR was determined by estimating the costs to develop the
acquired technology into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting
net cash flows from the projects, and discounting the net cash flows to their
present value. The revenue projection used to value the IPR was based on
estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in
technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us
and our competitors. The resulting net cash flows from such projects were based
on management estimates of cost of sales, operating expenses and income taxes
from such projects. A risk-adjusted discount rate of 25% was utilized to
discount projected cash flows.
ISADRA ACQUISITION
The write-off of IPR related to the acquisition of Isadra totaled $136
million, which was expensed as a one time non-recurring charge. The allocation
of $136 million represents the estimated fair value related to incomplete
projects based on risk adjusted cash flows. At the date of the acquisition, the
projects associated with the IPR efforts had not yet reached technological
feasibility and had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, these costs were
expensed. At the acquisition date, Isadra was conducting development,
engineering and testing activities associated with the completion of next
generation technologies. The projects under development, at the valuation date,
were expected to address emerging market demands for business-to-business
e-commerce.
At the acquisition date, the technologies under development were between
70% and 80% complete, based on project man-months and costs. Isadra had spent
approximately $30 million on the IPR projects and expected to spend
approximately $10 million to complete the IPR projects.
In allocating the purchase price, we considered present value calculations
of income, an analysis of project accomplishments and completion costs, an
assessment of overall contributions, as well as project risks. The values
assigned to IPR were determined by estimating the costs to develop the
purchased technology into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting
net cash flows from each project, excluding the cash flows related to the
portion of each project that was incomplete at the acquisition date, and
discounting the resulting net cash flows to their present value. Each of the
project forecasts were based upon future discounted cash flows, taking into
account the state of development of each in-process project, the cost to
complete that project, the expected income stream, the life cycle of the product
ultimately developed and the associated risks. A risk-adjusted discount rate of
50% was utilized to discount projected cash flows.
4 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
On December 19, 2000, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our
VerticalNet Exchanges segment to Converge, Inc. Converge, an independent
marketplace that serves the high-tech supply-chain community. VerticalNet
Exchanges was comprised of NECX, a business purchased in December 1999, and its
subsequent acquisitions of RW Electronics and F Capital, Inc. d/b/a American
IC Exchange AICE in March 2000 and July 2000, respectively. In consideration
for the transaction, we received 10,371,319 shares of Series B convertible
preferred stock and 1,094,751 shares of non-voting common stock, representing
approximately 180% and 19% of Converge equity, respectively. We were also
entitled to receive $600 million of cash at closing, subject to adjustment
based on a comparison of NECX net worth
66
70
VERTICALNET, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
and working capital as of October 31, 2000 and as of the closing date. Based on
a preliminary calculation performed on January 31, 2001, the closing date, we
paid $65 million to Converge. This cash payment is subject to further
adjustment based on a final calculation of NECX closing date net worth and
working capital following a post-closing audit. We expect to pay Converge an
additional $60 million based on the final net worth and working capital
adjustment calculation.
The sale of NECX was treated as a nonmonetary exchange pursuant to the
guidance in APB No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, and EITF Issue
No. 00-05, Determining Whether a Nonmonetary Transaction is an Exchange of
Similar Productive Assets. Accordingly, we will use the fair value of NECX of
approximately $2150 million, as determined by an independent appraisal, to
value our investment in Converge. In addition, we used this amount in
determining the loss on disposition of approximately $820 million, which
includes estimated losses of $90 million through January 31, 2001, the date the
transaction closed. The investment in Converge will be accounted for under the
cost method of accounting for investments based on the guidance in APB No. 18,
The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.
The sale of NECX represents the disposal of a business segment under APB
No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations -- Reporting the Effects of Disposal
of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently
Occurring Events and Transactions. Accordingly, the results of this segment have
been shown separately as a discontinued operation, and prior periods have been
restated. Additionally, the net assets of the discontinued operation have been
classified separately on the consolidated balance sheets.
Revenues and losses from the discontinued operation are as follows                                  YEAR ENDED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
The following are businesses acquired in 1999 and 2000, which have been
disposed of as part of the sale of our VerticalNet Exchanges segment NECX
In December 1999, we acquired substantially all of the assets and
liabilities of NECX for approximately $141 million cash and $700 million of
notes convertible into common stock. The notes were valued at the estimated fair
value of the shares into which they were convertible, based on the average of
the stock price for a few days before and after the date the transaction was
announced. On the date of the definitive agreement, the notes were convertible
into 2,008,738 shares of our common stock valued at approximately $995 million.
Since the notes were required to be paid in common stock and it was our
intention to convert the notes once a registration statement was declared
effective, the notes were accounted for as common stock to be issued. In April
2000, a registration statement registering the underlying shares of the
convertible notes was declared effective and the actual number of shares issued
upon the conversion of the notes was 1,768,034. Additionally, we assumed certain
liabilities including $100 million in debt and a $220 million line of credit,
which were paid off upon the transaction closing.
NECX was a privately-held leader in buying and selling semiconductors,
electronic components, computer products and networking equipment. The
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and the excess of the purchase price
over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired of approximately $1155
million was allocated to strategic relationships, including customer and vendor
lists, assembled workforce and goodwill in the amounts of approximately $130
million, $25 million and $1000 million, respectively. The assembled workforce
was being amortized on a straight-line basis over 48 months, while strategic
relationships and goodwill were being amortized on a straight-line basis over 60
months.
RW ELECTRONICS
On March 31, 2000, NECX acquired substantially all of the assets and
liabilities of RW Electronics for approximately $145 million in cash and
720,652 shares of our common stock valued at approximately $730 million. Based
on the purchase agreement terms, an additional 311,741 shares of common stock
were issued to the RW Electronics shareholders due to a decline in the market
value of our common stock upon the registration of the shares with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in May 2000. Additionally, NECX assumed
certain liabilities, including a $229 million line of credit, which was paid
off upon the transaction closing. RW Electronics was a privately-held company
engaged in buying and selling semiconductors, electronic components, computer
products and networking equipment. The acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase and the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the
tangible net assets acquired of approximately $763 million was allocated to
strategic relationships, including customer and vendor lists, assembled
workforce and goodwill in the amounts of approximately $150 million, $05
million and $608 million, respectively. The assembled workforce is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over 48 months, while strategic relationships
and goodwill are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 60 months.
AMERICAN IC EXCHANGE
On July 13, 2000, NECX acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed
certain of the liabilities of AICE for 1,097,457 shares of our common stock
valued at approximately $549 million. We agreed to pay additional consideration
payable in shares of our common stock upon the achievement of negotiated
financial and operating targets. As of December 31, 2000, we had issued an
additional 239,552 shares of our common stock valued at approximately $81
million for earnout provisions that had been earned. The acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase and the excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of the tangible net assets acquired of approximately $513 million was
allocated to developed technology, trade name                     68

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
strategic relationships, assembled workforce and goodwill in the amounts of
approximately $80 million, $54 million, $47 million, $06 million and $326
million, respectively. In January 2001, in connection with the sale of NECX to
Converge, we settled AICE remaining earnout provisions by issuing an
additional 1,101,549 shares of our common stock valued at approximately $100
million.
DISCONTINUED OPERATION -- LINE OF CREDIT AND SECURITIZATION FACILITY
In February 2000, NECX entered into a $330 million revolving line of
credit, which was amended in March 2000 to increase the line amount to $500
million. In conjunction with the completion of a securitization facility in
September 2000, we repaid the outstanding line of credit borrowing and
terminated the agreement.
In September 2000, NECX entered into a five year $750 million agreement to
sell, on an ongoing basis, a pool of its trade accounts receivable to a
wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary the SPS. The SPS
sold an undivided ownership interest in the pool of receivables to a financial
institution the Conduit. Under the terms of the agreement, new receivables
were added to the pool as collections reduced previously sold receivables. NECX
serviced, administered and collected the receivables on behalf of the SPS and
the Conduit. Proceeds of approximately $1300 million were received during the
year ended December 31, 2000 from the sale of receivables. During the year ended
December 31, 2000, the SPS recorded a net loss of approximately $07 million
from the related sales to the Conduit. The proceeds were used to repay the NECX
line of credit and for working capital purposes. The securitization facility was
transferred to Converge as part of the sale of NECX and was no longer available
to us as of January 31, 2001.

8 LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES
In July 2000, we entered into forward sale contracts relating to our
investment in Ariba. Under these contracts, we pledged our shares of Ariba
common stock to the counterparty for a three-year period in return for
approximately $474 million of cash. At the conclusion of the three-year period,
we have the option of delivering either cash or the pledged Ariba shares to
satisfy the forward sale. However, we will not be required to deliver shares in
excess of those we pledged. If we choose to deliver Ariba shares to satisfy the
forward sale, the number of Ariba shares to be delivered at maturity may vary
depending on the then market price of Ariba common stock. The fair value of
our Ariba shares at December 31, 2000 was approximately $229 million and is
included in long-term investments.
The fair value of the obligation in connection with the forward sale is
$226 million as of December 31, 2000 and is reflected in other long-term
liabilities. The initial cost of the transaction, which was approximately $50
million, is being amortized over the life of the agreement.
9 MICROSOFT RELATIONSHIP
On March 29, 2000, we entered into a definitive agreement with Microsoft
with respect to a commercial relationship. Our commercial relationship with
Microsoft has a three-year term during which Microsoft will purchase from us,
and then distribute to third party businesses, at least 80,000 of our
storefronts and e-commerce centers. We will assist Microsoft in distributing
30,000 of these storefronts and e-commerce centers. Microsoft will pay us a
minimum of approximately $1619 million in the aggregate over the term for the
storefronts and e-commerce centers. Microsoft will provide the storefronts and
e-commerce centers it purchases from us to business customers for a 12 month
subscription period. We will build the storefront or e-commerce center for each
customer, which will be placed on one of our e-marketplaces. Our intent is that
customers would purchase renewals of the storefront or e-commerce center and
additional storefronts or e-commerce centers on our other e-marketplaces. If a
customer renews its storefront or e-commerce center beyond the initial 12 month
period, we will pay an amount to Microsoft based on the aggregate amount of such
renewals. We will also pay an amount to Microsoft based on the amount of sales
of additional storefronts and e-commerce centers on other e-marketplaces. We are
also obligated to pay to Microsoft an amount based on the amount of the revenues
we receive from transactions that take place on the e-commerce centers
distributed under the agreement. We will pay Microsoft an aggregate of $600
million during the term for advertising and promotional placements in The
Microsoft Network and on Microsoft bCentral Web site and, if the pace of
Microsoft distribution of storefronts and e-commerce centers does not meet
agreed upon goals, additional amounts for advertising and promotional placements
not to exceed $150 million in the aggregate.
Microsoft will pay to us a portion of revenues from transactions that occur
in The Microsoft Network and on Microsoft bCentral Web site and originate via
a link from our e-marketplaces or the VerticalNet home page. Microsoft will pay
us an aggregate of $600 million during the term for advertising and promotional
placements in our e-marketplaces. We will pay Microsoft an aggregate of $185
million over the term to be directed toward the development and enhancement of
products and services relating to the business-to-business marketplace and
database software technology.

VERTICALNET, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
We will use commercially reasonable efforts during the term to adopt and
use Microsoft products to operate our e-marketplaces when appropriate and
feasible. We will pay Microsoft an aggregate of $565 million over the term
towards the licensing of Microsoft products and the provision of Microsoft
services.
Expected cash flows from this arrangement, net of cash payments we are
required to make to Microsoft, are approximately $492 million and $51 million
in 2001 and 2002, respectively.
During the year ended December 31, 2000, we received $676 million from
Microsoft, of which approximately $305 million was recognized as advertising
and e-enablement revenue and approximately $371 million remains in deferred
revenue on the December 31, 2000 consolidated balance sheet. Additionally,
during the year ended December 31, 2000, we paid $299 million including
royalty expenses of $05 million to Microsoft, of which approximately $120
million was expensed for advertising, royalties, licensing and support services,
approximately $05 million was capitalized and approximately $174 million is
recorded as a prepaid expense of which $55 million is included in non-current
other assets for future advertising, licensing of Microsoft products and the
use of Microsoft services.

least 20 trading days during the 30-day trading period ending on the trading day
before we mail notice that we intend to redeem the debentures. If we redeem the
debentures, we must redeem at a price equal to 1013125% of the principal
amount, pay any accrued but unpaid interest and make an interest make-whole
payment equal to the present value of the interest that would have accrued from
the redemption date through September 26, 2002.
In April 2000, approximately $933 million of the 5 1/4% convertible
subordinated debentures were converted into 4,664,750 shares of common stock. In
connection with the conversion, we made an inducement payment of approximately
$112 million to the related debt holders which is included in other income
expense and wrote off against additional paid-in capital approximately $29
million in deferred debt offering costs attributable to the portion of debt
converted to equity.
We have several capital leases with various financial institutions for
computer and communications equipment used in operations with lease terms
ranging from three to five years. Additionally, we have an insurance premium
financing agreement for directors and officers liability insurance. The interest
rates under the leases and insurance premium financing agreement range from 8%
to 20%. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the book value of assets held under
capital leases were approximately $26 million and $28 million, respectively,
and the aggregate remaining minimum lease and financing agreement payments at
December 31, 2000 were approximately $27 million, including interest of
approximately $02 million.

respect to these actions will not have a materially adverse effect on our
financial position or results of operations.
13 CAPITAL STOCK
At December 31, 1999, VerticalNet restated Articles of Incorporation
provided the authority to issue 90,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000
shares of blank check preferred stock.
To accommodate the split of our common stock effected on March 31, 2000, we
filed an amendment to our amended and restated Articles of Incorporation on
March 29, 2000 to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock
by 36,787,533 to 126,787,533 shares. The amendment was filed to increase the
number of authorized shares of common stock by the number of outstanding shares
of common stock as of March 17, 2000, the record date for the split of our
common stock.
On January 15, 2000 and June 14, 2000, the board of directors and the
shareholders of VerticalNet, respectively, approved an amendment to our amended
and restated Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized
shares of our common stock to 1,000,000,000 shares. On July 28, 2000, we filed
this amendment with the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
SERIES A 600% CONVERTIBLE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK
In April 2000, Microsoft made a $1000 million equity investment in
VerticalNet through the purchase of 100,000 shares of our Series A 600%
convertible redeemable preferred stock Series A Preferred Stock, which are
initially convertible into 1,151,080 shares of our common stock, and the
warrants described below. On April 1, 2010, at the election of the holder of the
Series A Preferred Stock, we shall be required to redeem all outstanding shares
of Series A Preferred Stock at a specified price. In addition, at our option,
each share of Series A Preferred Stock will be subject to redemption at a
calculated price if certain conditions are met. Microsoft is entitled to
registration rights and has the right to nominate one member of our board of
directors, which it has done. The warrants Microsoft received entitle Microsoft
to purchase 1,500,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $6950
per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances.
Based on an independent valuation of the Series A Preferred Stock and the
warrants issued to Microsoft, fair values of $895 million and $180 million
were recorded, respectively. The fair value of the warrants was recorded as
additional paid-in capital. The approximately $76 million excess of the fair
value over the actual cash received was recorded as a deferred cost in other
assets and is being amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the
period of the commercial agreement.

Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to cumulative
preferred dividends accumulating at a rate of 600% of the liquidation
preference $1,000 per share per year, payable quarterly in arrears on each
January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year. As of December 31, 2000,
cumulative dividends of approximately $45 million had been earned by the holder
of the Series A Preferred Stock. Dividends may be paid in cash, additional
Series A Preferred Stock or common stock. In August 2000, cumulative dividends
of approximately $15 million were paid to Microsoft through the issuance of
additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Additionally the accretion
related to the Series A Preferred Stock was approximately $08 million during
the year ended December 31, 2000.
We may not declare or pay, or set aside funds to pay, any dividend or other
distribution to the holders of our common stock or any other security ranking
junior to the Series A Preferred Stock unless we have previously declared and
paid, or set aside funds to pay, all dividends for preceding dividend periods to
which the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled. In the event of
a liquidation, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will receive a
liquidation preference in the amount of $1,000 per share, plus any accumulated
and unpaid dividends, before any distribution is made to common shareholders.
Based on the guidance in EITF Issue No. 00-19, Accounting for Derivative
Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company Own
Stock, for which a consensus was reached in the fourth quarter of 2000, the
Series A Preferred Stock has been classified outside of shareholders' equity.

carryforwards and temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax
purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred
tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the
periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible
amounts become deductible. Due to the uncertainty of our ability to realize the
benefit of the deferred tax assets, the deferred tax assets are fully offset by
a valuation allowance at December 31, 2000 and 1999. The net change in the
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at December 31, 2000 and 1999 was an
increase of $1634 million and $316 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2000, we have approximately $4102 million of net
operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes. These
carryforwards will begin expiring in 2011 if not utilized. In addition, we have
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $4102 million in certain
states with various expiration periods beginning in 2002. The majority of state
net operating losses are subject to a $20 million annual limitation and begin
expiring in 2006.
Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the utilization of a corporation net
operating loss carryforward is limited following a greater than 50% change in
ownership within a three year period. Due to our prior and current equity
transactions, a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards are subject to
an annual limitation. At December 31, 2000, we had consolidated pre-limitation
net operating loss carryforwards available for future use of approximately $241
million. This amount is subject to an annual limitation of approximately $209
million.
Included in the pre-limitation net operating loss carryforwards are losses
that were generated by companies acquired in 2000 and 1999. The losses generated
by acquired companies prior to their acquisition generally are available to
offset future taxable income of the acquiring company. However, upon the
80

VERTICALNET, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
acquisition of these companies, their net operating losses of approximately
$103 million became subject to an annual limitation of approximately $20
million.
Additionally, at December 31, 2000, approximately $850 million of the
gross deferred tax asset will reduce equity and approximately $35 million of
the gross deferred tax asset will reduce goodwill to the extent such assets are
realized.

18 SEGMENT INFORMATION
Following the NECX acquisition in December 1999, management segmented our
business into two operating segments consisting of vertical trade communities
currently referred to as e-marketplaces and the electronics exchange business.
In September 2000, we announced plans to organize our business into three
strategic business units: VerticalNet Markets, VerticalNet Solutions and
VerticalNet Exchanges. Due to the early stage of VerticalNet Solutions'
operations and our need to determine the allocation of resources between
VerticalNet Markets and VerticalNet Solutions, management continued to operate
and measure the performance of VerticalNet Markets and VerticalNet Solutions as
one unit for the remainder of fiscal 2000. Management expects to have the
ability to begin evaluating VerticalNet Solutions as a separate segment in the
first quarter of 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2000, approximately $79
million of our total revenue was attributable to VerticalNet Solutions.
Due to management decision to sell the VerticalNet Exchanges segment, all
prior segment information for VerticalNet Exchanges has been classified as a
discontinued operation.
19 APPOINTMENT AND RESIGNATION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
On July 27, 2000, Joseph Galli, Jr. joined VerticalNet as our president,
chief executive officer and a member of the board of directors. On December 29,
2000, Mr. Galli resigned his positions with VerticalNet.
In July 2000, we granted 30 million stock options to Mr. Galli at an
exercise price of $700 below the closing per share price on the date of grant.
This grant resulted in the recording of $210 million of deferred compensation,
which we had begun to recognize over the vesting period of the options. All of
Mr. Galli options expired unvested upon his resignation. Therefore, the
remaining deferred compensation balance, as well as the stock compensation
expense recorded during the year, were reversed.
On July 27, 2000, we advanced $40 million to Mr. Galli upon the
commencement of his employment with VerticalNet in the form of a non-interest
bearing loan until September 1, 2000, at which time the note was cancelled. On
September 1, 2000, we loaned him approximately $14 million under a note bearing
interest at 65% per annum with a term expiring on November 10, 2000, on which
date he repaid in full all principal and accrued interest on the note. On
December 29, 2000, Mr. Galli signed a $23 million promissory note payable to
VerticalNet bearing interest at 65% per annum, with $20 million in principal
and accrued interest

VERTICALNET, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
As part of our agreement with Sumitomo, we agreed to cooperate with
Sumitomo on a variety of joint initiatives, including Sumitomo participation
as an equity partner in our other international endeavors, and Sumitomo
licensing and distributing of technology, products and services for VerticalNet
Solutions and VerticalNet Markets. However, the parties have not reached, and
may never enter into, any definitive agreement concerning any additional
commercial relationship between them. During the year ended December 31, 2000,
we recognized approximately $09 million in revenue under a separate software
licensing agreement with Sumitomo.
RESTRUCTURING CHARGE
In January 2001, as part of a strategic and organizational initiative, we
announced a workforce reduction of approximately 150 employees. Employee
termination and facility closing costs will result in a one-time restructuring
charge of approximately $20 to $30 million in the first quarter of 2001.
CONVERGE
In December 2000, we entered into a three-year software licensing and
professional services contract with Converge, valued at approximately $1080
million. Performance under the contract began in 2001 following the closing of
the NECX sale. The contract provides for aggregate cash payments to us of $430
million, $350 million and $300 million during the years ending December 31,
2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. The commercial agreement also includes a
commitment to link Converge with each of our 14 technology-focused
e-marketplaces.
VERTICALNET EUROPE
Pursuant to agreements entered into with the shareholders of VerticalNet
Europe, our percentage ownership of VerticalNet Europe increased to
approximately 90% in the first quarter of 2001. We paid approximately $64
million in cash and issued 4,993,173 shares of our common stock to BT as well as
entered into a put and call agreement whereby we can buy their remaining
investment in VerticalNet Europe at any time after closing and they may put
their investment to us at any time after the first anniversary of the date of
this agreement. In 2001, ICG had a portion of their VerticalNet Europe shares
redeemed and sold the remaining portion directly to us for approximately $23
million in cash.
STOCK OPTIONS
On March 16, 2001, we issued an aggregate grant of approximately 134
million stock options to our employees. These options vest quarterly over a two
year period starting on May 15, 2001.
