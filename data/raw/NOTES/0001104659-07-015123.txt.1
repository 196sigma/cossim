Item 8 and in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesDerivative Financial
InstrumentsForeign Currency Forward Contracts contained in PartII, Item
7 of this Annual Report on Form10-K. 46 The Company may use other derivative instruments from
time to time, such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to
foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps related to access
to additional sources of international financing. These instruments can
potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust interest rate
exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings
denominated in another currency. At December31, 2006 and 2005, the
Company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap
agreements outstanding.
The Companys outstanding
debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing
subsidiary. The Company believes that this enables it to better match operating
cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of
assets and liabilities. The amount of outstanding debt denominated in a
functional currency other than the U.S. dollar was $344million and $2628million
at December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in 2006 compared
with 2005 was due to the maturity of the Companys 5625% euro notes with a
face value of 2000million as
discussed above.
Commodities
The Company uses various
commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and energy products such as
electric power and natural gas in conjunction with its manufacturing processes.
Generally, the Company acquires these components at market prices and does not
use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices. Moreover, the Companys
supply chain team seeks to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw
material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess
inventories. The Company does not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance
of production requirements. As a result, the Company is exposed to market risks
related to changes in commodity prices of these components. 47 Item 8. Financial

48 Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
Sealed Air Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Sealed Air Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2006
and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders
equity, cash flows and comprehensive income for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2006. In connection with our audits
of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited consolidated
financial statement ScheduleIIValuation and qualifying accounts and
reserves. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Sealed Air Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31,
2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2006, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Notes 2 and 21 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company changed its method of quantifying errors
effective January1, 2006. Also, as discussed in Note 14 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting
for defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans effective December31,
2006.
We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States, the effectiveness of Sealed Air Corporations internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on criteria
established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report
dated February 27, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements
assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial
reporting.

Amounts in tables in millions of dollars, except share and per share data
Note1 General
Sealed Air Corporation the Company, operating
through its subsidiaries, manufactures and sells a wide range of food and
protective packaging products.
The Company conducts
substantially all of its business through two direct wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Cryovac,Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation US. These two
subsidiaries directly and indirectly own substantially all of the assets of the
business and conduct operations themselves and through subsidiaries around the
globe. The Company adopted this corporate structure in connection with the
Cryovac transaction. See Note16 for a description of the Cryovac
transaction and related terms used in these Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Note2 Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of
Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company has eliminated all
significant inter-company transactions and balances in consolidation. All
amounts are approximate due to rounding. Prior period amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current years presentation. The principal
reclassification was related to investing activities of $51 million which were
reclassified from operating activities to investing activities in the Companys
2005 consolidated statement of cash flows. This reclassification had no impact
on the consolidated statements of operations or the consolidated balance sheets
and was immaterial to the Companys consolidated statement of cash flows.
The Company, in accordance
with Staff Accounting Bulletin No108, Considering the Effects of Prior
Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements, SAB108 increased its beginning retained earnings for
fiscal 2006 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. See Note 21
for additional information on the application of SAB 108.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of
financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, known as U.S.
GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and
expenses during the period reported. These estimates include assessing the
collectibility of accounts receivable, the use and recoverability of inventory,
the realization of deferred tax assets, useful lives and recoverability of
tangible and intangible assets, assumptions used in the Companys defined
benefit pension plans, estimates related to self-insurance such as the
aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience, insurance
company estimates and estimated trends in claim values, valuation allowances
related to deferred taxes, and accruals for commitments and contingencies,
among others. The Company reviews estimates and assumptions periodically and
reflects the effects of revisions in the consolidated financial statements in
the period it determines any revisions to be necessary. Actual results could
differ from these estimates. 55 Financial
Instruments
The Company may use cross currency swaps, interest
rate swaps, caps and collars, U.S. Treasury lock agreements and foreign
exchange forward contracts and options relating to the Companys borrowing and
trade activities.
The Company may use these financial instruments from
time to time to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and
foreign exchange rates. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company faces
credit risk if the counterparties to these transactions are unable to perform
their obligations. However, the Company seeks to minimize this risk by entering
into transactions with counterparties that are major financial institutions
with high credit ratings.
The Company reports all derivative instruments on its
balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and
effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging purposes. Prior to
entering into any derivative transaction, the Company identifies the specific
financial risk it faces, the appropriate hedging instrument to use to reduce
the risk, and the correlation between the financial risk and the hedging
instrument. The Company uses purchase orders and historical data as the basis
for determining the anticipated values of the transactions to be hedged. The
Company does not enter into derivative transactions that do not have a high
correlation with the underlying financial risk. The Company regularly reviews
its hedge positions and the correlation between the transaction risks and the
hedging instruments.
The Company accounts for derivative instruments as
hedges of the related underlying risks if the Company designates these
derivative instruments as hedges and the derivative instruments are effective
as hedges of recognized assets or liabilities, forecasted transactions,
unrecognized firm commitments or forecasted intercompany transactions.
The Company records gains and losses on derivatives
qualifying as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income loss, to the
extent that hedges are effective and until the underlying transactions are
recognized in the consolidated statement of operations, at which time the Company
recognizes the gains and losses in the consolidated statement of operations.
The Company recognizes gains and losses on qualifying fair value hedges and the
related loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk in the
consolidated statement of operations.
The Companys practice is
to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability
matures or is sold or terminated, or if the Company determines the underlying
forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring. Any deferred gains
or losses associated with derivative instruments, which on infrequent occasions
may be terminated prior to maturity, are recognized in the statement of
operations over the period in which the income or expense on the underlying
hedged transaction is recognized.
Foreign Currency
Translation
In non-U.S. locations that
are not considered highly inflationary, the Company translates the balance
sheets at the end of period exchange rates with translation adjustments
accumulated in shareholders equity. The Company translates the statements of
operations at the average exchange rates during the applicable period. The
Company translates assets and liabilities of its operations in countries with
highly inflationary economies at the end of period exchange rates, except that
it translates specified financial statement amounts at historical exchange
rates. The Company translates items reflected in statements of operations of
its operations in countries with highly inflationary economies at average rates
of exchange prevailing during the period, except that it translates specified
financial statement amounts at historical exchange rates. 56 Commitments and
ContingenciesLitigation
On an ongoing basis, the
Company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims
brought against it. While it is typically very difficult to determine the
timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, the Company uses its best
judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to
the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable
estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable
losses, the Company makes estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if
any. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and
the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent
uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential
insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for
amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the
Company has previously made. The Company expenses legal costs, including those
legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as
incurred.
Revenue Recognition
The Companys revenue
earning activities primarily involve manufacturing and selling products, and
the Company considers revenues to be earned when the Company has completed the
process by which it is entitled to receive consideration. The following
criteria are used for revenue recognition: persuasive evidence that an
arrangement exists, shipment has occurred, selling price is fixed or
determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
Research and
Development
The Company expenses research
and development costs as incurred. Research and development costs were
$782million, $758million and $732million in 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively.
Stock-Based
Compensation
In December2004, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, commonly referred to as the FASB, issued
SFAS No123 revised, Share-Based Payment which replaces SFAS No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. SFAS No123 revised covers a wide range of share-based
compensation arrangements and requires that the compensation cost related to
these types of payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. Cost
is measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments
issued. The Companys primary stock-based
employee compensation program is its 2005 Contingent Stock Plan, which replaced
the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan. See Note17 for further information on
these plans.
Terminated Stock Option
Plans
As of March31, 1998
in connection with the Cryovac transaction see Note16, the Company
terminated stock option plans in which specified employees of the Cryovac
packaging business participated prior to that date, except with respect to options
that remained outstanding as of that date. All of these options had been
granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying
shares on the date of grant. All options outstanding upon the termination of
the stock option plans in 1998 had fully vested prior to December31,
2000. Since 1997, the Company has not issued any stock option awards and has no
plans to do so in the future.
Environmental
Expenditures
The Company expenses or
capitalizes environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing business
activities, as appropriate. The Company expenses expenditures that relate to an
existing condition caused  57 by past
operations and which do not contribute to current or future net sales. The
Company records liabilities when it determines that environmental assessments
or remediation expenditures are probable and that it can reasonably estimate
the cost or a range of costs associated therewith.
Income Taxes
The Company and its domestic subsidiaries filea
consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. The Companys non-U.S.
subsidiaries file income tax returns in their respective local jurisdictions.
The Company provides for income taxes on those portions of its foreign
subsidiaries accumulated earnings that it believes are not reinvested indefinitely
in their businesses.
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset
and liability method. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases and tax benefit carry forwards. The Company
determines deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period using
enacted tax rates.
The Company evaluates whether its taxable earnings
during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax
assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized
should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those
jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the
projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely, the Company
provides a valuation allowance.
In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the
Company estimates future taxable earnings, with consideration for the
feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax
benefit carry forwards, to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely
than not to be realized in the future. Valuation allowances related to deferred
tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax
rates and future taxable earnings. In the event that actual results differ from
these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to adjust the valuation
allowance, which could materially affect the Companys consolidated financial
statements.
In calculating its
worldwide provision for income taxes, the Company also evaluates its tax
positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired. Based
on this review, the Company may establish reserves for additional taxes and
interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities.
The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances,
including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law.
Cash and Cash
Equivalents
The Company considers
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at
the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Companys policy is to invest
cash in excess of short-term operating and debt service requirements in cash
equivalents and short-term investments discussed below. These instruments are
stated at cost, which approximates market value because of the short maturity
of the instruments.
Short-Term
InvestmentsAvailable-for-Sale Securities
The Companys short-term
investments consist of auction rate securities, which are classified as
available-for-sale securities. The Company determines the classification at the
time of purchase and reassesses it as of each balance sheet date.
Available-for-sale securities are marked-to-market based on quoted market
values of the securities, with the unrealized gains or losses, if any, reported
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss, net of tax.
The Company recognizes realized gains and losses on the sales of the securities
on a specific identification method and includes them in other income, net, in
its consolidated statement of operations. The Company includes interest and
dividends on securities  58 classified
as available-for-sale in other income, net. The Company has classified its
available-for-sale securities as current assets regardless of their maturity as
they are highly liquid and available for use in current operations.
Accounts Receivable
Securitization
The Companys two primary U.S. operating subsidiaries
are party to an accounts receivable securitization program under which they
sell eligible U.S. accounts receivable to an indirectly wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company that was formed for the sole purpose of entering into
this program. The wholly-owned subsidiary in turn may sell an undivided
ownership interest in these receivables to a bank or an issuer of commercial
paper administered by that bank. The wholly-owned subsidiary retains the
receivables it purchases from the two operating subsidiaries, except those as
to which it sells interests to the bank or to the issuer of commercial paper.
If the wholly-owned subsidiary sells undivided ownership interests in
receivables, the Company removes the transferred ownership interest amounts
from its consolidated balance sheet at the time of the sale and reflects the
proceeds from the sale in cash provided by operating activities in the
consolidated statement of cash flows.
The Company reflects
retained receivables in accounts receivable on its consolidated balance sheet,
and the carrying amounts thereof approximate fair value because of the
relatively short-term nature of the receivables. The Company reflects costs associated
with the sale of receivables in other income, net, in the Companys
consolidated statement of operations.
Accounts Receivable
In the normal course of
business, the Company extends credit to customers that satisfy pre-defined
credit criteria. Accounts receivable, as shown on the consolidated balance
sheets, are net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains
accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of its customers to make required payments. Additional allowances may
be required if the financial condition of the Companys customers deteriorates.
Inventories
The Company determines the
cost of most U.S. inventories on a last-in, first-out or LIFO cost flow basis.
The cost of U.S. equipment inventories and most non-U.S. inventories is
determined on a first-in, first-out or FIFO cost flow basis. The Company states
inventories at the lower of cost or market. The sale of inventory and the
related accounts receivable are classified as an operating activity in the
Companys consolidated statements of cash flows.
Property and
Equipment
The Company states property and equipment at cost,
except for property and equipment that have been impaired, for which the
Company reduces the carrying amount to the estimated fair value at the
impairment date. The Company capitalizes significant improvements, and the
Company charges repairs and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of
the assets to expense as incurred. The Company removes the cost and accumulated
depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of from the accounts and
recognizes any resulting gain or loss upon the disposition of the assets.
The Company depreciates
the cost of property and equipment over its estimated useful life on a
straight-line basis as follows: buildings20 to 40years; machinery and equipment5
to 10 years and other property and equipment3to 10years. 59 Goodwill and
Identifiable Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price
over the estimated fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. The Company
reflects identifiable intangible assets in other assets at cost. These assets
consist primarily of patents, licenses, trademarks and non-compete agreements.
The Company amortizes them over the shorter of their stated or statutory
duration or their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, generally
ranging from 3to 20years. Identifiable intangibles, other than
goodwill, individually and in the aggregate comprise less than 5% of the
Companys consolidated assets and therefore are immaterial to the Companys
consolidated balance sheets.
The Company uses the purchase method of accounting for
all business combinations and does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives, but instead tests such assets for impairment on a
reporting unit basis annually. The Company may initiate a review of goodwill
prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired.
A reporting unit is the
operating segment unless, at businesses one level below that operating segmentthe
component leveldiscrete financial information is prepared and regularly
reviewed by management, and the component has economic characteristics that are
different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the
operating segment, in which case the component is the reporting unit. The
Company uses a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment. The Company
must recognize an impairment charge for the amount, if any, by which the
carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. The Company derives an
estimate of fair values for the Company as a whole and for each of the Companys
reporting units using an income approach, which uses forecasted earnings and
cash flows, and a market approach, which uses comparisons to other businesses.
The Company performs this annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter
of each year. In addition, the Company
amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their
respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and
reviews these for impairment in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.
Long-Lived Assets
Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets
The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets,
other than goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be
recoverable. The Company recognizes impairments when the expected future
undiscounted cash flows derived from long-lived assets are less than their
carrying value. For these cases, the Company recognizes losses in an amount
equal to the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount. The
Company records assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment, where
management has the current ability to remove these assets from operations, at
the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost of disposition. The
Company suspends depreciation for these assets during the disposal period,
which is generally less than one year. Assumptions and estimates used in the
determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows and disposition
costs, may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and possible
impairment expense in the Companys consolidated financial statements. 60 Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations
The Company recognizes a
liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the
liability can be reasonably estimated. A conditional asset retirement
obligation is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in
which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future
event that may or may not be within the control of the Company. In addition,
the Company would record a corresponding amount by increasing the carrying
amount of the related long-lived asset, which is depreciated over the useful
life of such long-lived asset.
Self-Insurance
The Company retains the
obligation for specified claims and losses related to property, casualty,
workers compensation and employee benefit claims. The Company accrues for
outstanding reported claims, claims that have been incurred but not reported
and projected claims based upon managements estimates of the aggregate
liability for uninsured claims using historical experience, insurance company
estimates and the estimated trends in claim values. Although management
believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim
payments, it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from
the recorded liabilities.
Pensions
The Company maintains a
non-contributory profit sharing plan and contributory thrift and retirement
savings plan in which most U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to
participate. For a limited number of its U.S. employees and for some of its
non-U.S. employees, the Company maintains defined benefit pension plans. The
Company accounts for these pension plans in accordance with SFAS No158,
Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans. Under this accounting standard, the Company makes assumptions regarding
the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets. The
principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure future
obligations, the expected future rate of return on plan assets, the expected
rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions.
The measurement date used to determine the benefit obligations and the plan
assets is December31. In general, changes to these assumptions could have
a significant impact on the costs and liabilities recorded under SFAS
No158. 
Earnings per Common
Share
The Company calculates
basic earnings per common share by dividing net earnings ascribed to common
shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period.
The computation of diluted earnings per common share is similar, except that
the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period are adjusted to
reflect the potential issuance of dilutive shares, which includes the assumed
issuance of asbestos settlement shares and the effect of the conversion of the
Companys 3% convertible senior notes, and net earnings ascribed to common
shareholders are adjusted to reflect the reduction to interest expense, net of
income taxes, that would occur as a result of the assumed conversion of the 3%
convertible senior notes.
Note 3 Business Segment Information
The Company operates in two reportable business
segments: iFood Packaging and iiProtective Packaging. The Food
Packaging segment comprises primarily the Companys Cryovac food packaging
products. The Protective Packaging segment includes the aggregation of the
Companys protective packaging products and shrink packaging products, all of
which products are used principally for non-food packaging applications. 61 The Food Packaging segment consists primarily of
flexible materials and related systems such as shrink bag and film products,
non-shrink films, and associated packaging equipment systems marketed and sold
primarily under the Cryovac trademark. Customers use these products to package
a broad range of perishable foods, as well as medical products. Also included
in this segment are rigid packaging and absorbent pads, such as foam and solid
plastic trays and containers for the packaging of a wide variety of food
products and absorbent pads used for the packaging of meat, fish and poultry.

Goodwill by
Reportable Business Segment
In accordance with SFAS No131, Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, and because the
Companys management views goodwill as a corporate asset, the Company has
allocated all of its goodwill to the corporate level rather than to the
individual segments. However, in accordance with SFAS No142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets, the Company has allocated goodwill to each
reportable segment in order to perform its annual impairment review of
goodwill, which it does during the fourth quarter of each year. See Note8
for a discussion of the annual goodwill impairment review. 63 The
allocation of goodwill in accordance with SFAS No142 for the years ended
December31, 2006 and 2005 was as follows

Note 4 Short Term InvestmentsAvailable-for-Sale
Securities
At December31, 2006 and 2005, the Companys
available-for-sale securities consisted of auction rate securities for which
interest or dividend rates are generally re-set for periods of up to
90days. At December31, 2006, the Company held $339 million of
auction rate securities which were investments in preferred stock with no
maturity dates. At December31, 2005, the Company held $441million
of auction rate securities, of which $347million were investments in
preferred stock with no maturity dates and $94million were investments
in other auction rate securities with contractual maturities in 2031.
At December31, 2006
and 2005, the fair value of the available-for-sale securities held by the
Company was equal to their cost. There were no gross realized gains or losses
from the sale of available-for-sale securities in 2006 and 2005.
Note 5 Accounts Receivable Securitization Program
In December2001, the Company and a group of its
U.S. subsidiaries entered into an accounts receivable securitization program
with a bank and an issuer of commercial paper administered by the bank. On December7,
2004, which was the scheduled expiration date of this program, the parties
extended this program for an additional term of three years ending December7,
2007.
Under this receivables program, the Companys two
primary operating subsidiaries, Cryovac,Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation
US, sell all of their eligible U.S. accounts receivable to Sealed Air Funding
Corporation, an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that
was formed for the sole purpose of entering into the receivables program.
Sealed Air Funding in turn may sell undivided ownership interests in these
receivables to the bank and the issuer of commercial paper, subject to
specified conditions, up to a maximum of $1250million of receivables
interests outstanding from time to time.
Sealed Air Funding retains the receivables it
purchases from the operating subsidiaries, except those as to which it sells
receivables interests to the bank or the issuer of commercial paper. The
Company has structured the sales of accounts receivable by the operating
subsidiaries to Sealed Air Funding, and the sales of receivables interests from
Sealed Air Funding to the bank and the issuer of commercial paper, as true
sales under applicable laws. The assets of Sealed Air Funding are not
available to pay any creditors of the Company or of the Companys other
subsidiaries or affiliates. The Company accounts for these transactions as
sales of receivables under the provisions of SFAS No140, Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities. 64 To secure the performance of their obligations under
the receivables program, Sealed Air Funding and the operating subsidiaries
granted a first priority security interest to the bank, as agent, in accounts
receivable owned by them, proceeds and collections of those receivables and
other collateral. The bank and the issuer of commercial paper have no recourse
to the Companys, the operating subsidiaries or Sealed Air Fundings other
assets for any losses resulting from the financial inability of customers to
pay amounts due on the receivables when they become due. As long as a
termination event with respect to the receivables program has not occurred, the
operating subsidiaries service, administer and collect the receivables under the
receivables program as agents on behalf of Sealed Air Funding, the bank and the
issuer of commercial paper.
Prior to a termination event under the receivables
program, Sealed Air Funding uses collections of receivables not otherwise
required to be paid to the bank or the issuer of commercial paper to purchase
new eligible receivables from the operating subsidiaries. The Company has
undertaken to cause the operating subsidiaries to perform their obligations
under the receivables program.
The receivables program contains financial covenants
relating to interest coverage and debt leverage. The Company was in compliance
with these ratios at December31, 2006.
Under limited circumstances, the bank and the issuer
of commercial paper can terminate purchases of receivables interests prior to
the above dates. A downgrade of the Companys long-term senior unsecured debt
to BB- or below by Standard Poors Rating Services or Ba3 or below
by Moodys Investors Service,Inc., or failure to comply with interest
coverage and debt leverage ratios could result in termination of the
receivables program.
The operating subsidiaries did not sell any
receivables interests under the receivables program during 2006, and therefore
the Company did not remove any related amounts from the consolidated assets
reflected on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December31,
2006.
During 2005, Sealed Air Funding sold an undivided
ownership interest in $350million of eligible receivables under the
receivables program. Payments on the Companys receivables that were applied to
these receivables interests in accordance with the terms of the program reduced
the amount of receivables interests held by the bank or the issuer of
commercial paper that are parties to the program to zero during 2005.
Therefore, as of December31, 2005, neither the bank nor the issuer of
commercial paper held any receivables interests and the Company did not remove
any related amounts from the assets reflected on its consolidated balance sheet
at December31, 2005.
At December31, 2006 and 2005, the receivables
program provided for a program fee of 0375% per annum on the greater of the
unpaid amount of the receivables interests sold by Sealed Air Funding and 50%
of the $1250million purchase limit under the program. The receivables
program also provided for a commitment fee of 020% per annum on the lesser of
the unused portion of the program and 50% of the purchase limit under the
program.
The costs associated with
the receivables program are reflected in other income, net, in the Companys
consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December31,
2006, 2005 and 2004. These costs primarily relate to program and commitment
fees and other associated costs, which were $03million 04million and $05million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
The costs related to the loss on the sale of the receivables interests to the
bank or the issuer of commercial paper during 2005 were immaterial. There were
no costs related to the loss on the sale of receivables interests in 2006 and
2004 since the Company did not sell any receivables interests during those
years. 65 Note 6 Inventories

The Company determines the value of non-equipment U.S.
inventories by the last-in, first-out or LIFO inventory method. The value of
U.S. inventories determined by that method amounted to $1270 million and
$1392million at December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. If the
Company had used the first-in, first-out or FIFO inventory method, which
approximates replacement value, for these inventories, the balances would have
been $487 million and $356million higher at December31, 2006 and
2005, respectively.
Due to the application of SAB 108
on January1, 2006, the Company recorded a pre-tax adjustment to
inventories. See Note 21 for further discussion.

Note 8 Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets
Goodwill
As of December31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had
unamortized goodwill in the amount of $1,9571million and
$1,9088million, respectively. Goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives have to be tested for impairment at least annually in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No142. The Company completed its
annual testing for impairment for 2006, 2005 and 2004 during the fourth quarter
of each year and determined that no impairment charge was necessary on a
reporting unit basis in any of the periods. See Note3, Business Segment
Information, for the allocation of goodwill by business segment. 66 Identifiable
Intangible Assets
As of
December31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had identifiable intangible
assets with definite useful lives with a gross carrying value of
$539million and $594million, respectively, less accumulated
amortization of $370million and $479million, respectively. These
identifiable intangible assets are included in other assets and are considered
immaterial to the Companys consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of
identifiable intangible assets was approximately $50million for 2006.
Assuming no change in the gross carrying value of identifiable intangible
assets from the value at December31, 2006, the estimated amortization for
future years is as follows: 2007$40million;
2008$31million; 2009$22million; 2010$12million; and
2011$11million. At December31, 2006 and 2005, there were no
identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill, with indefinite useful
lives as defined by SFAS No142.

requirements in connection with its lines of credit.
Revolving Credit
Facilities
The
Credit FacilityThe Company has not borrowed under
its $5000million unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility
since its inception in July2005. This facility contains a provision under
which the Company may request, prior to each of the first and second
anniversaries of the facility, a one-year extension of the termination of the
facility. The Company requested an extension effective on the first
anniversary, July26, 2006, and lenders with commitments for $4570
million under the facility consented to the extension. Accordingly, on July26,
2006 this extension became effective, as a result of which $430million
of the facility will terminate on July26, 2010 and $4570 million of the
facility will terminate on July26, 2011.
The credit facility is available for general corporate
purposes including the payment of a portion of the $5125million cash
payment, plus accrued interest which was $1235million at December31,
2006, required to be paid upon the effectiveness of an appropriate plan of
reorganization in the W.R.GraceCo. bankruptcy. The
Company may re-borrow amounts repaid under the credit facility from time to
time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the credit facility.
Facility fees are payable at the rate of 0125% per annum on the total amounts
available under the credit facility. The credit facility provides for changes
in facility fees based on the Companys long-term senior unsecured debt
ratings.
The Companys obligations under the credit facility
bear interest at floating rates, which are generally determined by adding the
applicable borrowing margin to the base rate or the interbank rate for the
relevant currency and time period. The credit facility provides for changes in
borrowing margins based on the Companys long-term senior unsecured debt
ratings.
The terms include a requirement that, upon the
occurrence of specified events that would adversely affect the settlement
agreement in the Grace bankruptcy proceedings or would materially increase the
Companys liability in respect of the Grace bankruptcy or the asbestos
liability arising from the Cryovac transaction, the Company would be required
to repay any amounts outstanding under the credit facility, or refinance the
facility, within 60days. See Note16, Commitments and Contingencies
under the captions Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs and Cryovac
Transaction; Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction for further
discussion.
ANZ
FacilityThe Company has an Australian
dollar 1700million, dual-currency revolving credit facility, known as
the ANZ facility, equivalent to U.S. $1329million at December31,
2006, due March2010. A syndicate of banks made this facility available to
a group of the Companys Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries for general
corporate purposes including refinancing of previously outstanding indebtedness.
The Company may re-borrow amounts repaid under the ANZ facility from time to
time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the facility.
The Company borrowed under the ANZ facility during the
second quarter of 2006, but it repaid those amounts in full and did not borrow
further under the ANZ facility during 2006. There were no amounts outstanding
under this facility at December31, 2006 or at December31, 2005.
The Companys obligations
under the ANZ facility bear interest at floating rates, which are generally
determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the base rate or the
interbank rate for the relevant currency and time period. The ANZ facility
provides for changes in borrowing margins based on the Companys long-term senior
unsecured debt ratings. 69 Other Lines of
Credit
Substantially all the
Companys short-term borrowings of $202million and $218million at
December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were outstanding under lines of
credit available to several of the Companys foreign subsidiaries. The weighted
average interest rate on these outstanding lines of credit was 125% and 123%
at December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Amounts available under these
credit lines as of December31, 2006 and 2005 were approximately
$1980million and $2001million, respectively, of which
approximately $1778million and $1783million, respectively, were
unused.
3% Convertible
Senior Notes
In July2003, the Company issued 3% convertible
senior notes that were exempt from registration in reliance upon Rule144A
and other available exemptions under the Securities Act of 1933.
Upon issuance of the 3% convertible senior notes, the
holders had the right to convert those notes into shares of the Companys
common stock at a conversion rate of 142857 shares per $1,000 principal amount
of the notes, which was equivalent to a conversion price of $7000 per share,
subject to anti-dilution adjustments, before the close of business on June30,
2033. In accordance with the
anti-dilution provisions of the indenture governing the 3% convertible
senior notes, as a result of the
payment of quarterly dividends on the Companys common stock, in December2006 the conversion rate was
adjusted to 144437 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, which is
equivalent to a conversion price of $6923per share. Holders may
convert their convertible senior notes only under the following circumstances: 1during
any calendar quarter, if the closing sale price of the Companys common stock exceeds
120% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive
trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter; 2during
any period in which ithe long-term credit rating assigned to the notes
by Standard Poors Rating Services, a division of the McGraw-Hill
Companies, or Moodys Investors Services,Inc. is lower than BB+ or Ba2,
respectively, iieither Standard Poors or Moodys no longer
rates the notes or has withdrawn or suspended this rating, or iiithe
notes are not assigned a rating by both Standard Poors and Moodys;
3during the five business day period immediately after any five
consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal
amount of notes for each day of that period was less than 98% of the product of
the closing sale price of the Companys common stock and the conversion rate; 4if
the notes have been called for redemption; or 5upon the occurrence of
specified corporate events. None of these circumstances that would allow for
conversion of the notes has arisen at any time since their issuance.
The Company has the option to redeem the 3%
convertible senior notes beginning July2, 2007 at a price equal to
101286% of their aggregate principal amount, declining ratably to 100% of
their aggregate principal amount on June30, 2010.
The holders of the 3% convertible senior notes have
the option to require the Company to repurchase the 3% convertible senior notes
on June30 of 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and 2028, or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change in or a
termination of trading of the Companys common stock, at a price equal to 100%
of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
In connection with the
issuance of the 3% convertible senior notes, on September5, 2003 the
Company filed a registration statement on FormS-3 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to register for resale the 6,160,708 shares
of the Companys common stock issuable, subject to anti-dilution adjustments,
upon conversion of the notes. The registration statement became effective on January23,
2004. None of the notes have been converted and consequently none of those
shares were issued or sold. The Companys obligation to keep the registration
statement effective has expired. As permitted under the registration rights
agreement between the Company and the initial purchasers of the notes, the
Company was permitted to terminate the registration statement. On September2,
2005, the Company filed a post-effective amendment to the registration
statement deregistering the shares. 70 Debt Redemption and
Repurchases
2004 Debt
Redemption
On November26, 2004,
the Company used net cash of $2118million to redeem the entire
outstanding aggregate principal amount, $1775million, of its 875%
senior notes due July1, 2008 and terminated interest rate swaps on the
875% senior notes having a total notional amount of $150million. The
Company issued the senior notes on June26, 2001 under Rule144A and
RegulationS of the Securities Act of 1933. The Company determined the
redemption price in accordance with the indenture governing the notes. The net
cash used of $2118million consisted of cash used to purchase the senior
notes at a premium plus accrued interest of $2134million and cash
received of $16million related to the termination of the interest rate
swaps. The Company completed the redemption, funded with available cash, at a
premium to the face amount of the notes, which resulted in a loss of
$296million, which the Company reflected in the statement of operations
as Loss on debt redemption and repurchases. The annual interest expense on
the redeemed notes was approximately $155million without giving effect
to any interest rate swaps and the amortization of amounts related to the
senior notes.
2004 Debt
Repurchases
In Novemberand December2004,
the Company used available cash of $252million to repurchase in the open
market $227million face amount of its 695% senior notes due May2009
which included accrued interest and related fees. Since the Company completed
these repurchases at a premium to the face amount of the notes, it incurred a
loss of $26million, which the Company reflected in the statement of
operations as Loss on debt redemption and repurchases.
Covenants
Each issue of the Companys
outstanding senior notes imposes limitations on the Companys operations and
those of specified subsidiaries. The principal limitations restrict liens, sale
and leaseback transactions and mergers, acquisitions and dispositions. The
credit facility contains financial covenants relating to interest coverage,
debt leverage and minimum liquidity and restrictions on the creation of liens,
the incurrence of additional indebtedness, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations,
asset sales, and amendments to the asbestos settlement agreement discussed
above. The ANZ facility contains financial covenants relating to debt leverage,
interest coverage and tangible net worth and restrictions on the creation of
liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and asset sales, in each case
relating to the Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries of the Company that are
borrowers under the facility. The Company was in compliance with the above
financial covenants and limitations, as applicable, at December31, 2006 and 2005. 71 Debt Maturities

Note11
Derivatives and Hedging Activities
The Company reports all derivative instruments on the
balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and
effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging purposes.
The Company is exposed to
market risk, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and
changes in interest rates. To manage the volatility relating to these
exposures, the Company enters into various derivative instruments from time to
time under its risk management policies. The Company designates derivative
instruments as hedges on a transaction basis to support hedge accounting. The
changes in fair value of these hedging instruments offset in part or in whole
corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying
exposures being hedged. The Company assesses the initial and ongoing
effectiveness of its hedging relationships in accordance with its documented
policy. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes. The Companys practice is to terminate
derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures or is sold
or terminated, or if the Company determines the underlying forecasted
transaction is no longer probable of occurring.
Foreign Currency
Forward Contracts
The Company is exposed to market risk, such as
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys subsidiaries
have foreign currency exchange exposure from buying and selling in currencies
other than their functional currencies. The primary purpose of the Companys
foreign currency hedging activities is to manage the potential changes in value
associated with the amounts receivable or payable on transactions denominated
in foreign currencies.
At December31, 2006
and 2005, the Company was party to foreign currency forward contracts with an
aggregate notional amount of $3310million maturing through June2007
and $3093million, which matured through September2006,
respectively. The estimated fair values of these contracts, which represent the
estimated net payments that would be paid or received by the Company in the
event of termination of these contracts based on the then current foreign
exchange rates, was a net receivable of $01 million at December31, 2006
and $06million at December31, 2005. These contracts qualified and
were designated as cash flow hedges and had original maturities of less than
twelve months. 72 Interest Rate Swaps
From time to time, the Company may use interest rate
swaps to manage its mix of fixed and floating rates on its outstanding
indebtedness.
At December31, 2006, the Company had outstanding
interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $3000million that
qualified and were designated as fair value hedges. The Company entered into
these interest rate swaps to effectively convert its 5375% senior notes due April2008
into floating rate debt. At December31, 2006 and 2005, the Company
recorded a mark to market adjustment to record a decrease of $89 million and
$125 million, respectively, in the fair value of the 5375% senior notes due April2008
due to changes in interest rates and an offsetting increase to other
liabilities to record the fair value of the related interest rate swaps. There
was no ineffective portion of the hedges recognized in earnings during the
period.
In 2006 and 2005, under
the terms of the $3000million outstanding interest rate swap agreements,
the Company received interest at a fixed rate and paid interest at variable
rates that were based on six-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or
LIBOR. As a result, interest expense increased by $66million and $16
million for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Other Derivative
Instruments
The Company may use other
derivative instruments from time to time, such as foreign exchange options to
manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency
swaps related to access to additional sources of international financing. These
instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust
interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for
borrowings denominated in another currency. At December31, 2006 and 2005,
the Company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap
agreements outstanding.
Cash Flow Hedges
The Company records gains and losses on derivatives
qualifying as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income loss, to the
extent that these hedges are effective and until it recognizes the underlying
transactions in earnings, at which time it recognizes these gains and losses in
the consolidated statement of operations.
Other comprehensive income loss for the years ended December31,
2006, 2005 and 2004 reflected net unrealized after tax losses of $07 million
$11 million pre-tax, $08 million $12 million pre-tax and $04 million
$08 million pre-tax, respectively.
The estimated net amount
of the existing unrecognized net gain on derivative instruments that the
Company expects to be reflected in the consolidated statement of operations
within the next twelve months is $10 million, pre-tax. The unrealized amounts
in other comprehensive income loss will fluctuate based on changes in the
fair value of open contracts during each reporting period. The Companys cash
flow hedges for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005 were effective
hedges, meaning that they qualified for hedge accounting treatment.
Note 12 Financial
Instruments
Under U.S. GAAP, the Company must disclose its
estimate of the fair value of material financial instruments, including those
recorded as assets or liabilities in its consolidated financial statements and
derivative financial instruments. 73 The carrying amounts of current assets and liabilities
approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities.
The fair value of the Companys senior notes in 2006
and 2005 and the euro notes in 2005, are based on quoted market prices. The
Company derived the fair value estimates of the Companys various other debt
instruments by evaluating the nature and terms of each instrument, considering
prevailing economic and market conditions, and examining the cost of similar
debt offered at the balance sheet date. These estimates are subjective and
involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, and therefore the
Company cannot determine them with precision. Changes in assumptions could
significantly affect the Companys estimates.
The fair value of the debt in the table below differs
from the carrying amount due to changes in interest rates based on market
conditions as of December31, 2006 and 2005. Generally, the fair value of
fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest
rates rise.
The fair values of the Companys various derivative
instruments, which are based on current market rates, generally reflect the
estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the
contracts at the reporting date.
The carrying amounts and
estimated fair values of the Companys financial instruments at December31,
2006 and 2005 were as follows

Credit and Market
Risk
Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose
the Company to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk
related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates. The Company manages
its exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit
standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor
concentrations of credit risk.
The Company does not expect any of its counterparties
in derivative transactions to fail to perform as they are substantial
investment and commercial banks with high credit ratings and financial strength
and  74 have significant
experience using such derivative instruments. Nevertheless, there is a risk
that the Companys exposure to losses arising out of derivative contracts could
be material if the counterparties to these agreements fail to perform their
obligations.
The Company monitors the impact of market risk on the
fair value and cash flows of its derivative and other financial instruments
considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates
and restricts the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging
activities. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for
trading or other speculative purposes and does not use leveraged derivative
financial instruments.
The Company continually
monitors the creditworthiness of its diverse base of customers to which it
grants credit terms in the normal course of business and generally does not
require collateral. The Company considers the concentrations of credit risk
associated with its trade accounts receivable to be commercially reasonable and
believes that such concentrations do not leave it vulnerable to significant
risks of near-term severe adverse impacts. The terms and conditions of the
Companys credit sales are designed to mitigate concentrations of credit risk
with any single customer. The Companys sales are not materially dependent on a
single customer or a small group of customers.
Note13 Global
Manufacturing Strategy, Restructuring and Other Charges
Global Manufacturing Strategy
The Companys global manufacturing strategy, when
implemented, will expand production in countries where demand for the Companys
products and services has been growing significantly. At the same time, the
Company intends to realign certain manufacturing capacity in North America and
Europe into centers of excellence. The goals of this multi-year program are to
expand capacity in growing markets, further improve the Companys operating
efficiencies, and implement new technologies more effectively. The Company
expects this program, combined with the Companys supply chain initiative, to
produce meaningful savings in future years. By taking advantage of new
technologies and streamlining production on a global scale, the Company expects
to continue to enhance its profitable growth and its global leadership
position.
In
July2006, the Company announced the first phase of this multi-year global
manufacturing strategy. The financial scope of this phase is expected to be as
follows

The associated costs include such items as equipment

expenditures and charges for associated costs to occur between 2007 and 2008,
although the actual timing of these expenditures is subject to change due to a
variety of factors.
During
2006, all charges for the associated costs related to the food packaging

The Company has accrued $116 million in severance
costs in connection with this strategy. These costs will be future cash
expenditures that will be incurred for one-time termination benefits. At the
time the severance was accrued, the Company expected to eliminate 242 full-time
positions. Since that time, the Company revised the number of positions to be
eliminated to 245. During 2006, 36 positions were eliminated and the remaining
positions are expected to be eliminated in 2007. The Company expects these
benefits will be paid out before the end of 2009. The Company expects to add
approximately 120 full-time employees at other facilities as production is
transferred, so the net reduction in positions is expected to be 125. The
Company reflected the $116 million of severance costs in its consolidated
statement of operations for 2006 in restructuring charges.
The
components of the restructuring charges, spending and other activity through
December31, 2006 and the remaining accrual balance at December31,

amount is reflected in other current liabilities on the Companys consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2006. The remaining accrual of $52 million is
expected to be paid in 2008 and 2009 and is reflected in other liabilities on
the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006.
Other 2006 Restructuring Activities
During 2006, the Company accrued severance costs of
$06 million related to the Companys consolidation of its food packaging
customer service activities in Canada. Such amount was reflected in the
consolidated statement of operations on the restructuring charges line. The
Company expects to eliminate 9 full-time positions. No cash payments were made
during 2006 related to this accrual. The accrual balance at December31,
2006 was $06 million which was reflected in other current liabilities on the
Companys consolidated balance sheet.
2004 Restructuring Program
During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company
announced a series of separate profit improvement plans in various geographic
regions in order to complement the Companys long-term growth programs and
financial goals, improve the Companys operating efficiencies and lower its
overall cost structure. The plans principally reduced the number of employees
and consolidated or relocated operations in both of the Companys reportable
business segments.
At December31, 2004, the Company expected to
eliminate 473 full-time positions, which was increased to 475 during 2005. As
an element of the program, the Company expected to add approximately 100
positions in connection with the Companys realignment or relocation of some of
its manufacturing activities, so that the net reduction in positions was
approximately 375. These actions affected principally  76 production workers and
members of the Companys sales force, primarily in Europe. The Company has completed
its reduction in headcount related to its 2004 restructuring program.
The
charges for the year ended December31, 2004 consisted of the following

The long-lived asset
impairment of $103million consisted of write-downs and write-offs
of property and equipment. The impairments related to decisions to rationalize
and realign production of some of the Companys smaller product lines and to
close several smaller European manufacturing facilities. Since the undiscounted
cash flows associated with these asset groups, including estimated salvage
value, were less than the carrying values of these asset groups, they were
written down to their estimated fair value. The Company disposed of these
facilities and much of the equipment during the first six months of 2006.
The

December31, 2006 and the remaining accrual balance at December31,

The Company expects to pay
$13million of the remaining $14million accrual balance in 2007
and $01million in 2008.
For the year ended December31, 2006, the Company
recorded in its consolidated statement of operations an additional
restructuring charge of $06million which was related to the 2004
program. This amount includes additional costs related to the relocation of
employees and assets from closed facilities which were completed in 2006. The
Company also recorded in its consolidated statement of operations a net credit
of $01 million related to employee termination costs that were accrued as part
of the 2004 restructuring program. The modifications to the originally recorded
amounts resulted from increases in the amounts due to terminated employees of
$01million and reductions based upon certain employees no longer being
eligible for the termination benefits of $02million.
For the year ended
December31, 2005, the Company recorded $17million of additional
charges related to the 2004 restructuring program. This amount includes
$13million of costs incurred in 2005  77 related
to the relocation of assets and employees from facilities that were closed as
part of the restructuring program. The Company also recorded a net charge of
$04million related to the employee termination costs that were accrued
as part of the 2004 restructuring program. The modifications to the originally
recorded amounts resulted from increases in the amounts due to terminated
employees of $09million and reductions based upon certain employees no
longer being eligible for the termination benefits of $05million.

Employee Benefits and Incentive Programs
Profit-Sharing and Retirement Savings Plans
The Company has a
non-contributory profit-sharing plan covering most of its U.S. employees.
Contributions to this plan, which are made at the discretion of the Board of
Directors, may be made in cash, shares of the Companys common stock, or in a
combination of cash and shares of the Companys common stock. The Company also
maintains a contributory thrift and retirement savings plan in which most of
its U.S. employees are eligible to participate. The contributory thrift and
retirement savings plan generally provides for Company contributions based upon
the amount contributed to the plan by the participants. Company contributions
to or provisions for its profit-sharing plan and thrift and retirement
savings plan are charged to operations and amounted to $304million 300 million and $270million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In
2006, 2005 and 2004 there were no shares of common stock issued for the Companys
contribution to its profit-sharing plan.
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
As required, the Company
adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No158,
Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No87, 88, 106 and 132R SFAS No158,
as of December31, 2006. SFAS No158 requires, among other things,
the recognition of the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan. Each
over funded plan is recognized as an asset and each under funded plan is
recognized as a liability. The initial impact of the standard due to
unrecognized prior service costs and net actuarial gains or losses as well as
subsequent changes in the funded status is recognized as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss in the line item unamortized pension
liability which is included in total shareholders equity. The amount of
unamortized pension liability is recorded net of tax. Additional minimum
pension liabilities and related intangible assets are also derecognized upon
adoption of the new standard. The measurement date used by the Company to
determine the benefit obligations and the plan assets is December31. In
accordance with SFAS No158, the Companys 2005 accounting and related
disclosures were not affected by the adoption of the new standard. The table
below summarizes the incremental effects of SFAS No158 adoption on the
individual line items in the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December31,

The Company reviews the expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets annually, taking into consideration the Companys asset
allocation, historical returns, and the current economic environment.
The Companys long-term objectives for plan
investments are to ensure that athere is an adequate level of assets to
support benefit obligations to participants over the life of the plans, bthere
is sufficient liquidity in plan assets to cover current benefit obligations,
and cthere is a high level of investment return consistent with a
prudent level of investment risk. The investment strategy is focused on a
long-term total return in excess of a pure fixed income strategy with
short-term volatility less than that of a pure equity strategy. To accomplish
this objective, the Company causes assets to be invested in a balanced and
diversified mix of equity and fixed income investments. The target asset
allocation will typically be 50-65% in equity securities, with a maximum
equity allocation of 75%, and 35-50% in fixed income securities, with a
minimum fixed income allocation of 25% including cash.

Postretirement Benefit Plans
The Company generally does not offer its employees
postretirement benefits other than programs that are required by the foreign
countries in which the Company operates. In the U.S., the Company offers a
program that is fully funded by the participating retired employees. These
programs are not material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. 83 Since March31, 1998,
the Company has offered to some U.S. employees of the Cryovac packaging
business a fixed subsidy applicable to participation in its U.S. postretirement
healthcare program. At December31, 2006 and 2005, the accrued benefit
liability associated with these subsidies amounted to $25 million and
$23million, respectively. The net periodic postretirement expense and
credit components, together with other remaining postretirement healthcare plan
disclosures under SFAS No132, are not material to the Companys
consolidated financial statements.

concluded that it is more likely than not that it will realize the $3700million
balance of deferred tax assets at December31, 2006, net of the valuation
allowance of $376 million. The valuation allowance is related to the
uncertainty of utilizing $959million of foreign net operating loss carry
forwards, or $275million on a tax-effected basis, most of which have no
expiration period, and $449million of foreign investment tax allowances,
or $101million on a tax-effected basis, that have no expiration period.

Commitments and Contingencies
Asbestos Settlement
and Related Costs
On November27, 2002, the Company reached an
agreement in principle with the Committees appointed to represent asbestos
claimants in the bankruptcy case of W. R. Grace Co., known as Grace,
to resolve all current and future asbestos-related claims made against
the Company and its affiliates in connection with the Cryovac transaction
described below. The settlement will also resolve the fraudulent transfer
claims, successor liability claims, as well as indemnification claims by
Fresenius Medical Care Holdings,Inc. and affiliated companies, that had
been made against the Company in connection with the Cryovac transaction. On December3,
2002, the agreement in principle was approved by the Companys Board of
Directors. The Company received notice that both of the Committees had approved
the agreement in principle as of December5, 2002. For a description of
the Cryovac Transaction, asbestos-related claims and the parties
involved, see Cryovac Transaction and Contingencies Related to the Cryovac
Transaction below.
The Company
recorded a charge of $8501million as a result of the asbestos settlement
in its consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31,
2002. The charge consisted of the following items a
non-cash charge of $5125million covering a cash payment that the Company
will be required under the settlement to make upon the effectiveness of a plan
of reorganization in the Grace bankruptcy. Because the Company cannot predict
when a plan of reorganization may become effective, the Company recorded this
liability as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheet at December31,
2002. Under the terms of the settlement, this amount accrues interest at a 55%
annual rate from December21, 2002 to the date of payment. The Company has
recorded this interest in interest expense in the consolidated statement of
operations and in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
The accrued interest, which is compounded annually, was $1235million and
$903million at December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
a
non-cash charge of $3215million representing the fair market value at
the date the Company recorded the charge of nine million shares of the Companys
common stock expected to be issued under the settlement upon the effectiveness
of Graces plan of reorganization. These shares are subject to customary
anti-dilution provisions that adjust for the effects of stock splits, stock
dividends and other events affecting the Companys common stock. The fair
market value of the Companys common stock was $3572 per share as of the close
of business on December5, 2002.  85 The Company recorded this
amount in its consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2002 as follows 09million representing the aggregate par value of these shares in
common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement, and the
remaining $3206million, representing the excess of the aggregate fair
market value over the aggregate par value of these common shares, in additional
paid-in capital. The December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 diluted earnings per
common share calculations reflect the shares of common stock reserved for
issuance related to the asbestos settlement.
$161million
of legal and related fees as of December31, 2002.
Asbestos settlement and
related costs in 2006, 2005 and 2004 reflected legal and related fees for
asbestos-related matters of $16million, $22million and
$20million, respectively.
Cryovac Transaction On March31, 1998,
the Company completed a multi-step transaction that brought the Cryovac
packaging business and the former Sealed Air Corporations business under the
common ownership of the Company. These businesses operate as subsidiaries of
the Company, and the Company acts as a holding company. As part of that
transaction, the parties separated the Cryovac packaging business, which
previously had been held by various direct and indirect subsidiaries of the
Company, from the remaining businesses previously held by the Company. The
parties then arranged for the contribution of these remaining businesses to a
company now known as W. R. Grace Co., and the Company distributed
the Grace shares to the Companys stockholders. As a result, W. R. Grace
Co. became a separate publicly owned company. The Company recapitalized its
outstanding shares of common stock into a new common stock and a new
convertible preferred stock. A subsidiary of the Company then merged into the
former Sealed Air Corporation, which became a subsidiary of the Company and
changed its name to Sealed Air Corporation US.
Contingencies
Related to the Cryovac Transaction
In connection with the Cryovac transaction, Grace and
its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations
before the Cryovac transaction, whether accruing or occurring before or after
the Cryovac transaction, other than liabilities arising from or relating to
Cryovacs operations. Among the liabilities retained by Grace are liabilities
relating to asbestos-containing products previously manufactured or sold
by Graces subsidiaries prior to the Cryovac transaction, including its primary
U.S. operating subsidiary, W. R. Grace Co.Conn., which has operated
for decades and has been a subsidiary of Grace since the Cryovac transaction.
The Cryovac transaction agreements provided that, should any claimant seek to
hold the Company or any of its subsidiaries responsible for liabilities
retained by Grace or its subsidiaries, including the asbestos-related
liabilities, Grace and its subsidiaries would indemnify and defend the Company.
Since the beginning of 2000, the Company has been
served with a number of lawsuits alleging that, as a result of the Cryovac
transaction, the Company is responsible for alleged asbestos liabilities of
Grace and its subsidiaries, some of which were also named as co-defendants in
some of these actions. Among these lawsuits are several purported class actions
and a number of personal injury lawsuits. Some plaintiffs seek damages for
personal injury or wrongful death, while others seek medical monitoring,
environmental remediation or remedies related to an attic insulation product. Neither
the former Sealed Air Corporation nor Cryovac ever produced or sold any of the
asbestos-containing materials that are the subjects of these cases. None
of these cases has reached resolution through judgment, settlement or
otherwise. As discussed below, Graces Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding has
stayed all these cases. 86 While the allegations in
these actions directed to the Company vary, these actions all appear to allege
that the transfer of the Cryovac business as part of the Cryovac transaction
was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability. Under a theory
of successor liability, plaintiffs with claims against Grace and its
subsidiaries may attempt to hold the Company liable for liabilities that arose
with respect to activities conducted prior to the Cryovac transaction by W. R.
Grace Co.Conn. or other Grace subsidiaries. A transfer would be a
fraudulent transfer if the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent
value and the transferor was insolvent or was rendered insolvent by the
transfer, was engaged or was about to engage in a business for which its assets
constitute unreasonably small capital, or intended to incur or believed that it
would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature. A transfer may also
be fraudulent if it was made with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors.
If a court found any transfers in connection with the Cryovac transaction to be
fraudulent transfers, the Company could be required to return the property or
its value to the transferor or could be required to fund liabilities of Grace
or its subsidiaries for the benefit of their creditors, including asbestos
claimants. The Company has reached an agreement in principle and subsequently
signed a settlement agreement, described below, that is expected to resolve all
these claims.
In the Joint Proxy Statement
furnished to their respective stockholders in connection with the Cryovac
transaction, both parties to the transaction stated that it was their belief
that Grace and its subsidiaries were adequately capitalized and would be
adequately capitalized after the Cryovac transaction and that none of the
transfers contemplated to occur in the Cryovac transaction would be a
fraudulent transfer. They also stated their belief that the Cryovac transaction
complied with other relevant laws. However, if a court applying the relevant
legal standards had reached conclusions adverse to the Company, these
determinations could have had a materially adverse effect on the Companys
consolidated financial position and results of operations.
On April2, 2001,
Grace and a number of its subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the
District of Delaware. Grace stated that the filing was made in response to a
sharply increasing number of asbestos claims since 1999.
In connection with its
Chapter 11 filing, Grace filed an application with the Bankruptcy Court seeking
to stay, among others, all actions brought against the Company and specified
subsidiaries related to alleged asbestos liabilities of Grace and its
subsidiaries or alleging fraudulent transfer claims. The court issued an order
dated May3, 2001, which was modified on January22, 2002, under
which the court stayed all the filed or pending asbestos actions against the
Company and, upon filing and service on the Company, all future asbestos
actions. No further proceedings involving the Company can occur in the actions
that have been stayed except upon further order of the Bankruptcy Court.
Committees appointed to
represent asbestos claimants in Graces bankruptcy case received the courts
permission to pursue fraudulent transfer and other claims against the Company
and its subsidiary Cryovac,Inc., and against Fresenius, as discussed
below. The claims against Fresenius are based upon a 1996 transaction between
Fresenius and W. R. Grace Co.Conn. Fresenius is not affiliated with
the Company. In March2002, the court ordered that the issues of the
solvency of Grace following the Cryovac transaction and whether Grace received
reasonably equivalent value in the Cryovac transaction would be tried on behalf
of all of Graces creditors. This proceeding was brought in the U.S. District
Court for the District of Delaware Adv. No02-02210.
In June2002, the
court permitted the U.S. government to intervene as a plaintiff in the
fraudulent transfer proceeding, so that the U.S. government could pursue
allegations that environmental remediation expenses were underestimated or
omitted in the solvency analyses of Grace conducted at the time of the Cryovac
transaction. The court also permitted Grace, which asserted that the Cryovac
transaction was not a fraudulent transfer, to intervene in the proceeding. In July2002,
the court issued an interim ruling on the legal standards to be applied in the
trial, holding, among other things, that, subject to specified limitations,
post-1998 claims should be considered in the solvency analysis of Grace.
The Company believes that only  87 claims
and liabilities that were known, or reasonably should have been known, at the time
of the 1998 Cryovac transaction should be considered under the applicable
standard.
With the fraudulent
transfer trial set to commence on December9, 2002, on November27,
2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the Committees
prosecuting the claims against the Company and Cryovac,Inc., to resolve
all current and future asbestos-related claims arising from the Cryovac
transaction. On the same day, the court entered an order confirming that the
parties had reached an amicable resolution of the disputes among the parties
and that counsel for the Company and the Committees had agreed and bound the
parties to the terms of the agreement in principle. As discussed above, the
agreement in principle calls for payment of nine million shares of the Companys
common stock and $5125million in cash, plus interest on the cash payment
at a 55% annual rate starting on December21, 2002 and ending on the
effective date of the Grace plan of reorganization, when the Company is
required to make the payment. These shares are subject to customary
anti-dilution provisions that adjust for the effects of stock splits, stock
dividends and other events affecting the Companys common stock. On December3,
2002, the Companys Board of Directors approved the agreement in principle. The
Company received notice that both of the Committees had approved the agreement
in principle as of December5, 2002. The parties subsequently signed a
definitive settlement agreement as of November10, 2003 consistent with
the terms of the agreement in principle. On November26, 2003, the parties
jointly presented the definitive settlement agreement to the U.S. District
Court for the District of Delaware for approval. On Graces motion to the U.S.
District Court, that court transferred the motion to approve the settlement
agreement to the Bankruptcy Court for disposition.
On June27, 2005, the
Bankruptcy Court signed an order approving the definitive settlement agreement.
Although Grace is not a party to the settlement agreement, under the terms of
the order, Grace is directed to comply with the settlement agreement subject to
limited exceptions. The order also provides that the Court will retain
jurisdiction of any dispute involving the interpretation or enforcement of the
terms and provisions of the definitive settlement agreement. The Company
expects that the settlement agreement will become effective upon Graces
emergence from bankruptcy with a plan of reorganization that is consistent with
the terms of the settlement agreement.
On June8, 2004, the
Company filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the District of
Delaware, where the fraudulent transfer trial was pending, requesting that the
court vacate the July2002 interim ruling on the legal standards to be
applied relating to the fraudulent transfer claims against the Company. The
Company was not challenging the definitive settlement agreement. The motion was
filed as a protective measure in the event that the settlement agreement is
ultimately not approved or implemented; however, the Company still expects that
the settlement agreement will become effective upon the courts approval and
Graces emergence from bankruptcy with a plan of reorganization that is
consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement.
On July11, 2005, the
Bankruptcy Court entered an order closing the proceeding brought in 2002 by the
committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in the Grace bankruptcy
proceeding against the Company without prejudice to the Companys right to
reopen the matter and renew in its sole discretion its prior motion to vacate
the July2002 interim ruling on the legal standards to be applied relating
to the fraudulent transfer claims against the Company.
As a condition to the
Companys obligation to make the payments required by the settlement, Graces
plan of reorganization must be consistent with the terms of the settlement,
including provisions for the trusts and releases referred to below and for an
injunction barring the prosecution of any asbestos-related claims against
the Company and its affiliates. In that case, the settlement will provide that,
upon the effective date of Graces plan of reorganization and payment of the
shares and cash, all present and future asbestos-related claims against
the Company and its affiliates that arise from alleged asbestos liabilities of
Grace and its affiliates including former affiliates that became affiliates of
the Company through the Cryovac transaction will be channeled to and become
the responsibility of one or more trusts to be  88 established
under Section524gof the Bankruptcy Code as part of Graces plan
of reorganization. The settlement will also resolve all fraudulent transfer
claims against the Company and its affiliates arising from the Cryovac
transaction as well as the Fresenius claims described below. The settlement
will provide that the Company and its affiliates will receive releases of all
those claims upon payment. Under the agreement, the Company cannot seek
indemnity from Grace for the Companys payments required by the settlement. The
order approving the settlement agreement also provides that the stay of
proceedings involving the Company described above will continue through the
effective date of Graces plan of reorganization, after which, upon implementation
of the settlement agreement, the Company will be released from the liabilities
asserted in those proceedings and their continued prosecution against the
Company will be enjoined.
In January2005,
Grace filed a proposed plan of reorganization and related documents with the
Bankruptcy Court. There were a number of objections filed, and the Company does
not know whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the
settlement agreement or if the other conditions to the Companys obligation to
pay the settlement amount will be met. If these conditions are not satisfied or
not waived by the Company, the Company will not be obligated to pay the
settlement amount. However, if the Company does not pay the settlement amount,
the Company and its affiliates will not be released from the various asbestos-related,
fraudulent transfer, successor liability claims, and indemnification claims
made against them, and all of these claims would remain pending and would have
to be resolved through other means, such as through agreement on alternative
settlement terms or trials. In that case, the Company could face liabilities
that are significantly different from its obligations under the settlement
agreement. The Company cannot estimate at this time what those differences or
their magnitude may be. In the event these liabilities are materially larger
than the current existing obligations, they could have a material adverse
effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. The
Company cannot predict when a final plan of reorganization will become
effective or whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the
settlement agreement.
In January2002, the
Company filed a declaratory judgment action against Fresenius Medical Care
Holdings,Inc., its parent, Fresenius AG, a German company, and specified
affiliates in New York State court asking the court to resolve a contract
dispute between the parties. The Fresenius parties contended that the Company
was obligated to indemnify them for liabilities that they might incur as a
result of the 1996 Fresenius transaction mentioned above. The Fresenius parties
contention was based on their interpretation of the agreements between them and
W. R. Grace Co.Conn. in connection with the 1996 Fresenius
transaction. In February2002, the Fresenius parties announced that they
had accrued a charge of $1720million for these potential liabilities,
which included pre-transaction tax liabilities of Grace and the costs of
defense of litigation arising from Graces Chapter 11 filing. The Company
believed that it was not responsible to indemnify the Fresenius parties under
the 1996 agreements and filed the action to proceed to a resolution of the
Fresenius parties claims. In April2002, the Fresenius parties filed a
motion to dismiss the action and for entry of declaratory relief in its favor.
The Company opposed the motion, and in July2003, the court denied the
motion without prejudice in view of the November27, 2002 agreement in
principle referred to above. As noted above, under the settlement agreement,
there will be mutual releases exchanged between the Fresenius parties and the
Company releasing any and all claims related to the 1996 Fresenius transaction.
In November2004, the
Companys Canadian subsidiary Sealed Air Canada Co./Cie learned that it had
been named a defendant in the case of Thundersky
v. The Attorney General of Canada, et al. File No.CI04-01-39818,
which is pending in the Manitoba Court of Queens Bench. Grace and W.R.GraceCo.Conn.
are also named as defendants. The claim is brought as a putative class
proceeding and seeks recovery for alleged injuries suffered by any Canadian
resident, other than in the course of employment, as a result of Graces
marketing, selling, processing, manufacturing, distributing and/or delivering
asbestos or asbestos-containing products in Canada prior to the Cryovac
Transaction. Another proceeding was filed in January2005 in the Manitoba
Court of The Queens Bench naming the  89 Company
and specified subsidiaries as defendants. The latter proceeding, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of the Province of
Manitoba v. The Attorney General of Canada, et al. File No.CI05-01-41069,
seeks the recovery of the cost of insured health services allegedly provided by
the Government of Manitoba to the members of the class of plaintiffs in the Thundersky proceeding. In October2005,
the Company learned that six additional putative class proceedings had been
brought in various provincial and federal courts in Canada seeking recovery
from the Company and its subsidiaries Cryovac,Inc. and Sealed Air
Canada Co./Cie, as well as other defendants including W. R. Grace
Co. and W. R. Grace Co.Conn., for alleged injuries suffered by any
Canadian resident, other than in the course of employment except with respect
to one of these six claims, as a result of Graces marketing, selling,
manufacturing, processing, distributing and/or delivering asbestos or asbestos-containing
products in Canada prior to the Cryovac Transaction. Grace and W. R. Grace
Co.Conn. have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and
its affiliates in respect of any liability and expense, including legal fees
and costs, in these actions. In April2001, Grace Canada,Inc. had
obtained an order of the Superior Court of Justice, Commercial List, Toronto,
recognizing the Chapter 11 actions in the United States of America involving
Grace Canada,Inc.s U.S. parent corporation and other affiliates of Grace
Canada,Inc., and enjoining all new actions and staying all current
proceedings against Grace Canada,Inc. related to asbestos under the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act. That
order has been renewed repeatedly. In November2005, upon motion by Grace
Canada,Inc., the court ordered an extension of the injunction and stay to
actions involving asbestos against the Company and its Canadian affiliate and
the Attorney General of Canada, which had the effect of staying all of the
Canadian actions referred to above. The stay has been extended through April1,
2007, and the Company expects the stay to be further extended. Graces proposed
plan of reorganization provides that these claims will be paid by the trusts to
be established under Section524gof the Bankruptcy Code as part of
Graces plan of reorganization, and it is anticipated that the defendants will
ask the Canadian courts to enforce the terms of the plan of reorganization.
However, if Graces final plan does not include comparable provisions or if the
Canadian courts refuse to enforce Graces final plan of reorganization in the
Canadian courts, and if in addition Grace is unwilling or unable to defend and
indemnify the Company and its subsidiaries in these cases, then the Company
could be required to pay substantial damages, which the Company cannot estimate
at this time and which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys
financial condition and results of operations.
In view of Graces Chapter
11 filing, the Company may receive additional claims asserting that the Company
is liable for obligations that Grace had agreed to retain in the Cryovac
transaction and for which the Company may be contingently liable. To date, no
material additional claims have been asserted or threatened against the
Company.
Final determinations and accountings
under the Cryovac transaction agreements with respect to matters pertaining to
the transaction had not been completed at the time of Graces Chapter 11 filing
in 2001. The Company has filed claims in the bankruptcy proceeding that reflect
the costs and liabilities that it has incurred or may incur that Grace and its
affiliates agreed to retain or that are subject to indemnification by Grace and
its affiliates under the Cryovac transaction agreements, other than payments to
be made under the settlement agreement. Grace has alleged that the Company is
responsible for specified amounts under the Cryovac transaction agreements. Any
amounts for which the Company may be liable to Grace may be used to offset the
liabilities of Grace and its affiliates to the Company. The Company intends to
seek indemnification by Grace and its affiliates for defense costs related to
asbestos and fraudulent transfer litigation and the Fresenius claims, and
approximately $81million paid by the Company on account of its guaranty
of debt issued by W. R. Grace Co.Conn. Except to the extent of any
potential setoff or similar claim, the Company expects that its claims will be
as an unsecured creditor of Grace. Since portions of the Companys claims
against Grace and its affiliates are contingent or unliquidated, the Company
cannot determine the amount of the Companys claims, the extent to which these
claims may be reduced by setoff, how much of the claims may be allowed, or the
amount of the Companys recovery on these claims, if any, in the bankruptcy
proceeding. 90 On September15,
2003, the case of Senn v. Hickey, et al.
Case No03-CV-4372 was filed in the U.S. District Court for
the District of New Jersey Newark. This lawsuit seeks class action status on
behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired securities of the
Company during the period from March27, 2000 through July30, 2002.
The lawsuit names the Company and five current and former officers and
directors of the Company as defendants. The Company is required to provide
indemnification to the other defendants, and accordingly the Companys counsel
is also defending them. On June29, 2004, the court granted plaintiff
Miles Senns motion for appointment as lead plaintiff and for approval of his
choice of lead counsel. The plaintiffs amended complaint makes a number of
allegations against the defendants. The principal allegations are that during
the above period the defendants materially misled the investing public,
artificially inflated the price of the Companys common stock by publicly
issuing false and misleading statements and violated U.S. GAAP by failing to
properly account and accrue for the Companys contingent liability for asbestos
claims arising from past operations of Grace. The plaintiffs seek compensatory
damages and other relief. The Company is vigorously defending the lawsuit,
since the Company believes that it properly disclosed its contingent liability
for Graces asbestos claims and properly accounted for its contingent liability
for such claims under U.S. GAAP.
On March14, 2005,
the Company and the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended
complaint in the Senn v. Hickey, et al.
case for failure to state a claim. On December19, 2005, the Court granted
in part and denied in part defendants motion to dismiss. The Court determined
that the Complaint failed adequately to allege scienter as to the four
individual defendants other than T.J. Dermot Dunphy, and therefore dismissed
the lawsuit with respect to these four individual defendants, but adequately
alleged scienter as to Mr.Dunphy and the Company. Mr.Dunphy is a
current director of the Company and was formerly Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive Officer of the Company. On December28, 2005, the
defendants requested that the Court reconsider the portion of the December19,
2005 order denying defendants motion to dismiss with regard to the Companys
arguments other than scienter, or, in the alternative, that the Court certify
the matter for interlocutory appeal. On February13, 2006, the defendants
filed an answer to the amended complaint. On April7, 2006, the Court
heard oral argument on defendants reconsideration motion, and on July10,
2006, the Court denied the motion on the ground that issues of fact prevent the
Court from granting a motion to dismiss based on the Companys arguments other
than scienter. On October3, 2006, plaintiff filed a motion to certify a
class of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the securities of the
Company during the period from March27, 2000 through July30, 2002.
On November 22, 2006, plaintiff filed an amended motion for class
certification, seeking to withdraw as a class representative and the
substitution of a new class representative, the State of Louisiana Municipal
Police Employees Retirement System. Discovery concerning class certification
and the merits is ongoing. Although the Company believes that neither it nor
Mr.Dunphy should have any liability in this lawsuit, until the lawsuit
has progressed beyond its current, still preliminary, stage, the Company cannot
estimate the potential cost of an unfavorable outcome, if any.
Compliance Matters
In late 2005, the Company
identified travel and related expenses that had been paid by some of the
Companys foreign subsidiaries for trips by government officials who oversee
the regulation of the Companys medical products in a foreign country. Although
these expenses were accurately recorded as travel and entertainment expenses in
the Companys books and records, these activities appeared to have breached the
Companys Code of Conduct. More importantly, the Company was concerned that
these payments may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and
therefore outside counsel was retained and promptly began an internal
investigation. In March2006, the Company voluntarily disclosed to the
United States Department of Justice, or the DOJ, and the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, the factual information
obtained to date in the Companys internal investigation, including that these
payments were made between 2003 and 2005 and totaled less than
$02million. The internal investigation is ongoing, and the Company is cooperating
with the DOJ and the SEC. The  91 Company
cannot predict when this matter will be resolved or the terms upon which this
matter will be resolved, although the Company currently does not expect this
matter to be material to its consolidated results of operations, financial
position or cash flows. In connection with the investigation, the Company is
evaluating remedial measures and has taken or will take timely and appropriate
action where necessary.
Leases
The Company is obligated
under the terms of various leases covering primarily warehouse and office
facilities and production equipment, as well as smaller manufacturing sites
that it occupies. The Company accounts for the majority of its leases as
operating leases, which may include purchase or renewal options. Net rental
expense was $285 million, $283million and $282million for 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. Estimated future minimum annual rental commitments
under noncancelable real and personal property leases are as follows: 2007$256million;
2008$194million; 2009$119million; 2010$100million; 2011$94million;
and subsequent years$273million.
Long-Term Commitments
At
December 31, 2006, the Company has principal contractual obligations which include
agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods, including raw materials,
or services in the normal course of business aggregating to approximately
$1685 million. The estimated future cash outlays are as follows: 2007$794million; 2008$534million; 2009$119million; 2010$119million; 2011$64million; and subsequent years$55million.
Environmental Matters
The Company is subject to
loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and it
accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation
efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be
reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into account any discounting
for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance
recoveries, if any. The Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible
that its liability in excess of the amounts that it has accrued for
environmental matters will be material to its consolidated statements of
operations, balance sheets or cash flows. Environmental liabilities are
reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or remediation efforts
and their costs can be better estimated.
The Company evaluates
these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the
progress of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of
discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of
remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible
parties. As some of these issues are decided the outcomes of which are subject
to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably
estimated, the Company adjusts the recorded accruals, as necessary. The Company
believes that these exposures are not material to its consolidated results of
operations and balance sheets. The Company believes that it has adequately
reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures. 92 Note17 Shareholders Equity

Stock-Based Compensation
In December2004, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, commonly referred to as the FASB, issued
SFAS No123 revised, Share-Based Payment which replaces SFAS No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. SFAS No123 revised covers a wide range of share-based
compensation arrangements and requires that the compensation cost related to
these types of payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. Cost
is measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments
issued. The Company adopted SFASNo123 revised in the first
quarter of 2006 as required using the modified prospective application. Under
the modified prospective application, SFAS No123 revised applies to
all awards granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled by the Company since January1,
2006 and to unvested awards at the date of adoption. The Company was also
required to eliminate any unearned or deferred compensation related to earlier
awards against the appropriate equity account. At December31, 2005, the
Company had $178million of deferred compensation recorded in the
shareholders equity section of the condensed consolidated balance sheet. This
amount was eliminated against additional paid-in capital on January1,
2006. The adoption of SFAS No123 revised did not have a material
impact on the consolidated statement of operations as the amounts previously
recognized by the Company for stock awards under the 1998 and 2005 Contingent
Stock Plans are essentially the same as under SFAS No123.
Contingent Stock Plans
At the Companys annual
meeting of the stockholders held on May20, 2005, the stockholders
approved the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan of Sealed Air Corporation. The 2005
Contingent Stock Plan replaced the contingent stock plan that was approved by
the Companys stockholders in 1998. The 2005 Contingent Stock Plan is the
Companys sole long-term equity compensation program for officers and
employees, except that prior grants under the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan remain
subject to that plans provisions. The 2005 Contingent Stock Plan provides for
awards of equity-based compensation, including restricted stock,
restricted stock units, performance share units and cash awards measured by
share price, to executive officers and other key employees of the Company and
its subsidiaries, as well as U.S.-based key consultants to the Company.
During 2006, under the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan, the Company has  93 granted
restricted stock, restricted stock units and cash awards. An employee or
consultant selected by the Organization and Compensation Committee of the
Companys Board of Directors to receive an award may accept the award during
the 60-day period beginning when written notice of the award has been
sent to the participant, provided the participants relationship to the Company
has not changed.
The Companys 1998
Contingent Stock Plan provided for the grant to employees of awards to purchase
common stock during the succeeding 60-day period. The Organization and
Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors had set the price to
purchase the common stock pursuant to the grants under the 1998 Contingent
Stock Plan at $100 per share, subject to appropriate adjustments in the event
of any stock dividend, split-up, recapitalization, merger, or other events
affecting the Companys common stock. There is no similar purchase price under
the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan.
Awards made under the 2005
Contingent Stock Plan and shares issued under the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan
are restricted as to disposition by the holders for a period of at least three
years after award. In the event of termination of employment of a participant
prior to lapse of the restriction, the awards under the 2005 Contingent Stock
Plan are forfeited on the date of termination unless ithe termination
results from the participants death or permanent and total disability, or iithe
Organization and Compensation Committee affirmatively determines not to seek
forfeiture of the award in whole or in part. Likewise, shares of restricted
stock awarded under the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan are subject to a repurchase
option by the Company at the price at which the shares were issued. The forfeiture
provision of the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan and the repurchase provision of the
1998 Contingent Stock Plan expire upon vesting of the awards, except that these
provisions lapse sooner if specified events occur that affect the existence or
control of the Company.
For restricted stock
awards, the Company records compensation expense and credits additional paid-in
capital within shareholders equity based on the fair value of the award at the
grant date. For restricted stock unit awards, the Company records compensation
expense and credits additional paid-in capital within shareholders equity
based on the fair value of the award at the end of each reporting period. The
amount of the deferred compensation related to the restricted stock unit awards
is re-measured at each reporting period based on the then current stock price
and the effects of the stock price changes are recognized as compensation
expense. For cash awards, the Company records a liability, which is reflected
in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, and records
compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the end of each
reporting period. The amount of the liability is re-measured at each reporting
period based on the then current stock price and the effects of the stock price
changes are recognized as compensation expense. At December31, 2006, the
liability related to cash awards was immaterial to the Companys consolidated
balance sheet. The Company has not settled any cash awards during 2006.
Compensation expense
related to restricted stock, restricted stock units and cash awards is
recognized, net of estimated forfeitures in 2006 under SFAS No123
revised and net of actual forfeitures in 2005 and 2004 under SFAS No123,
over a three-year period on a straight-line basis. These charges are included in marketing, administrative and development
expenses and amounted to $140million and $119 million and $102 million
in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
At December31, 2006,
the weighted-average remaining contractual life of outstanding restricted
stock, restricted stock units and cash awards was approximately 16 years, 22
years, and 22 years, respectively, and had terms expiring up to 2009. The
total compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock, restricted stock
units and cash awards not yet recognized was $253million as of December31,
2006. At December31, 2006, there were 722,975 shares of nonvested
restricted stock, 93,900shares of nonvested restricted stock units and
nonvested cash awards measured by 3,000 shares outstanding. The 2005 Contingent
Stock Plan and the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan permit tax withholding
attributable to awards and other charges that may be required by law to be paid
by withholding a portion of the shares attributable to such awards. 94 A

Directors Stock Plan
Non-cash compensation comprises shares issued to
non-employee directors in the form of awards under the Companys 2002 Stock
Plan for Non-Employee Directors, which stockholders of the Company approved at
the 2002 annual meeting. The 2002 Directors Stock Plan provides for annual
grants of shares to non-employee directors, and interim grants of shares to
eligible directors elected at times other than at an annual meeting, at a price
per share equal to the par value of the shares, as all or part of the annual or
interim retainer fees for non-employee directors. During 2002, the Company
adopted a plan that permits non-employee directors to elect to defer all or
part of their annual retainer until the non-employee director retires from the
Board. The non-employee director can elect to defer the portion of the annual
retainer payable in shares of stock. If a non-employee director makes this
election, the non-employee director may also elect to defer the portion, if
any, of the annual retainer payable in cash. Cash dividends on deferred shares
are credited to the non-employee directors deferred cash account on the
applicable dividend payment date. The Company charges the excess of fair value
over the price at which shares are issued under this plan to operations. This
charge is included in marketing, administrative and development expenses and
amounted to $04 million, $04 million and $03 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Other Common Stock
Issuances
During 2004, the Company
issued 50,000 shares of its common stock, par value $010 per share, to a
non-employee under an intellectual property purchase agreement as prepaid
royalties under that agreement. These shares vest ratably over a five-year
period. The Company amortizes the cost associated  95 with
these shares on a straight-line basis. Amortization expense related to this
issuance was $05 million, $05 million and $04 million in 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively.
Stock Options
Stock option plans in which specified employees of the
Cryovac packaging business participated were terminated effective March31,
1998 in connection with the Cryovac transaction, except with respect to options
that remained outstanding as of that date. All of these options had been
granted at an exercise price equal to their fair market value on the date of
grant. All options outstanding upon the termination of the stock option plans
in 1998 had fully vested prior to December31, 2000. Since such options
were fully vested, SFAS No123 revised is not applicable. Since 1997,
the Company has not issued any stock option awards and has no plans to do so in
the future. At December31, 2006, these
options had a per share exercise price of $4219, a weighted-average
remaining contractual life of approximately 3 months, and terms expiring up to March2007.
During 2006, 2005 and
2004, the holders exercised options to purchase 69,839, 63,696 and 33,136,
respectively, with an aggregate exercise price of $29 million 25million and $11million, respectively. At December31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, the cumulative number of options to purchase 50,574,
47,885 and 46,820 shares of common stock, respectively, had expired. At December31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, options to purchase 17,233, 89,761 and 154,522 shares of
common stock, respectively, were outstanding at average per share exercise
prices of $4219, $4161 and $4071, respectively.
Cash Dividends 
The Company used cash of
$486 million during 2006 to pay quarterly cash dividends of $015 per common
share on March17, June16, September15, and December15,
2006. The payment of these dividends was reflected as a reduction to retained
earnings in the Companys consolidated balance sheet.
Note 18 Earnings Per Common Share
Basic earnings per common share were $338 for 2006 309 for 2005 and $256 for 2004. Diluted earnings per common share were $293
for 2006, $269 for 2005 and $225 for 2004.
In calculating diluted earnings per common share, the
Companys calculation of the weighted average number of common shares for 2006,
2005 and 2004 provides for the conversion of the Companys 3% convertible
senior notes due June2033 due to the application of EITF Issue No04-08,
The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share,
the assumed issuance of nine million shares of common stock reserved for the
Companys previously announced asbestos settlement referred to in Note16
to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Asbestos Settlement
and Related Costs and the exercise of dilutive stock options, net of assumed
treasury stock repurchases. 96 The

Note20Acquisitions On January3, 2006,
the Company acquired Nelipak Holdings B.V. for cash in the amount of
$412million, net of cash acquired, and assumed debt of approximately
$96million. The Company accounted for this acquisition under the
purchase method of accounting, which resulted in an allocation of goodwill of
$257 million. The Company allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed using estimated fair values. The Company also made
other smaller acquisitions in 2006. These acquisitions, including the
acquisition of Nelipak Holdings B.V. were not material to the Companys
consolidated financial statements. 97 Note 21 Staff
Accounting Bulletin No108 
In September2006, the SEC released SAB 108. SAB
108 provides guidance on how to evaluate prior period financial statement
misstatements for purposes of assessing their materiality in the current
period. There are two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of
financial statement misstatements: the rollover or income statement method
and the iron curtain or balance sheet method. Historically, the Company used
the rollover method. Under this method, the Company quantified its financial
statement misstatements based on the amount of errors originating in the
current-year income statement, and as result did not consider the effects of
correcting the portion of the current year balance sheet misstatement that
originated in prior years. SAB 108 now requires that the Company must consider
both the rollover and iron curtain methods dual method when quantifying
misstatements in the financial statements. The iron curtain method quantifies a
misstatement based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in
the balance sheet at the end of the current year, irrespective of the
misstatements origination. Upon application, SAB 108 permits the Company to
adjust for the cumulative effect of errors that were previously considered
immaterial under the rollover method that are now considered material under the
dual method. The SAB 108 adjustment affects the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities as of the beginning of the current year, with an offsetting
adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on January1, 2006.
In accordance with SAB
108, the Company has adjusted its opening retained earnings for 2006 for the
items described below. These errors had previously been considered immaterial
to the Companys consolidated financial statements using the rollover method.
Capitalization of
Overhead in Inventories
The Company adjusted its beginning
retained earnings for 2006 to reflect the capitalization of certain
manufacturing-related overhead costs in inventories. These costs were
previously expensed as incurred for a number of years. As a result of this
adjustment, the Company recorded an increase of $406 million to inventory and
a corresponding increase to retained earnings, before income taxes. 
General Inventory
Reserve 
The Company had maintained
a general inventory reserve on its consolidated balance sheet. This reserve was
established a number of years ago to recognize exposures regarding the
valuation of inventories that the Company believed existed at that time. This
amount was reversed under SAB No108, which resulted in an increase to
inventories of $60 million and a corresponding increase, before income taxes,
to retained earnings. 
Equipment
Depreciation
The Company adjusted its
beginning retained earnings for 2006 for a historical misstatement related to
the use of incorrect useful lives for the depreciation of certain equipment. This
adjustment accumulated over several years and resulted in an increase to
accumulated depreciation of $44 million and a corresponding reduction, before
income taxes, to retained earnings. 
Tax Valuation
Allowance
The Company adjusted its
beginning retained earnings for 2006 for a historical misstatement related to
income tax valuation allowances that exceeded the net deferred tax assets in
certain jurisdications, which accumulated over a period of several years. These
excess valuation allowances were reversed under SAB No108, which
resulted in an increase to deferred tax assets of $30 million and a
corresponding increase to retained earnings.  98 Impact of

Note22 New
Accounting Pronouncements 
Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements
In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157,
Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No157 clarifies the definition of fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the
disclosures on fair value measurements. SFAS No157 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.
In July2006, the
FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48 FINNo48 Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. The interpretation prescribes a consistent
recognition threshold and measurement attribute, as well as criteria for
subsequently recognizing, derecognizing and measuring such tax positions for
financial statement purposes. The interpretation also requires expanded
disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes. FIN No48 is
effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December15,
2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material
impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Subsequent Events
Two-For-One Stock
Split
On February16, 2007, the Companys Board of
Directors declared a two-for-one stock split of the Companys common stock, to
be effected in the form of a stock dividend. The stock dividend is payable on March16,
2007 at the rate of one additional share of the Companys common stock for each
share of the Companys common stock issued and outstanding to stockholders of
record at the close of business on March2, 2007.
This stock split will result in the issuance of
approximately 807 million additional shares of common stock and will be
accounted for by the transfer of approximately $81 million from additional
paid-in capital to common stock. In
addition, nine million additional shares of common stock will be reserved
related to the asbestos settlement and will be accounted for by the transfer of
$09 from additional paid-in capital to common stock reserved for issuance
related to asbestos settlement. Shares reserved
for issuance under the Companys 2005 Contingent Stock Plan, the 2002 Directors
Stock Plan and for the conversion of the Companys 3% convertible senior notes
will also be similarly adjusted. 99 Pro

2007 Quarterly Cash
Dividend
On February 16, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors
also increased the Companys quarterly cash dividend by 33% to $020 per common
share, declaring a quarterly cash dividend payable on the pre-split shares of
the Companys common stock on March 16, 2007 to stockholders of record at the
close of business on March 2, 2007. The estimate of this liability is $161
million and was calculated using 80,672,810 shares of common stock that were
issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2006.
Divestitures
On February9, 2007,
the Company sold its 50 percent interest in PolyMask Corporation to its joint
venture partner, 3M Company. The joint venture was formed in 1991 between the
Company and 3M to produce and sell non-packaging surface protection films. The
Company received an aggregate cash amount of approximately $360 million for
the transaction and other related assets and is expecting to record a pre-tax
gain of approximately $350 million $210 million after-tax in the first
quarter of 2007. The Company accounted for this joint venture under the equity
method of accounting. The consolidated statements of operations for the years
ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 include $39 million, $26 million
and $27 million, respectively, for the Companys proportionate share of
PolyMask Corporations net income, which is recorded in other income, net. The
Companys investment in this joint venture was not material to the Companys
consolidated financial statements.
