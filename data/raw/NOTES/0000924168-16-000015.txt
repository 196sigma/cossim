Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included the financial statement schedule appearing under Schedule II. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Energy Focus, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the financial schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein./s/ Plante Moran, PLLCCleveland, OhioMarch 9, 201636ENERGY FOCUS, INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETSAS OF DECEMBER 31,amounts in thousands except share data20152014ASSETSCurrent assets:Cash and cash equivalents$34,640$7,435Trade accounts receivable less allowances of $155 and $307,  net7,7326,869Prepaid and other current assets740899Current assets of discontinued operations1,070Total current assets53,22218,929Property and equipment, net2,429456Other assets5138Non-current assets of discontinued operations73Total  liabilities:Accounts payable$7,295$7,120Accrued liabilities2,917962Deferred revenue93133Credit line borrowings453Current liabilities of discontinued operations939Total current liabilities10,3059,607Other liabilities7746Long-term debt, net of current maturities70Total  EQUITYPreferred stock, par value $00001 per share:Authorized: 2,000,000 shares in 2015 and 2014 Issued and outstanding: no shares in 2015 and 2014Common stock, par value $00001 per share:Authorized: 30,000,000 shares in 2015 and 15,000,000 in 2014 Issued and outstanding: 11,648,978 at December 31, 2015 and 9,423,975 at December 31, 201411Additional paid-in  other comprehensive income469Accumulated deficit80,05088,830Total stockholders' equity45,3209,773Total liabilities and stockholders' equity$55,702$19,496The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements37ENERGY FOCUS, INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONSFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,amounts in thousands except per share data201520142013Net sales$64,403$22,700$9,423Cost of sales35,11114,9227,345Gross  expenses:Product  general, and  on impairment608Change in estimate of contingent  operating  loss from  income expense:Settlement of acquisition obligations892Interest expense852,689840Other expenses income53466308Income loss from continuing operations before income  for income taxes149Net income loss from continuing  operations:Loss from discontinued  gain on sale of discontinued  income from discontinued operations before income  from provision for income taxes1021Loss income from discontinued  income  income loss per share -

We operate in a single industry segment, developing and selling our energy-efficient light-emitting diode LED lighting products into the military maritime, and general commercial and industrial markets. We have aligned our resourced and focused our efforts on the sale of LED lighting products, in particular our military and commercial tubular LED TLED lines of products, into targeted vertical markets.During 2014, we shifted our focus away from the turnkey solutions business, which had historically incurred lower gross margins. We completed all outstanding solutions-based projects in the first quarter of 2015, are no longer accepting new projects, and had fully exited the business as of September 2015. In August 2015, we sold our United Kingdom subsidiary, Crescent Lighting Limited CLL. In 2013, we sold and discontinued our pool products business. As a result of exiting the turnkey solutions, CLL, and the pool products businesses, we have eliminated all net sales and expenses associated with both businesses from the Consolidated Statements of Operations and reported the net losses as discontinued operations. Please refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, for more information on our disposition of these businesses. Additionally, product development is a key focus for us. Our product development team is dedicated to developing and designing leading-edge technology LED lighting products, and we have recently opened product development centers in Taiwan and Minnesota. During 2013, we curtailed our efforts on bidding on research contracts and grants to focus on product development.NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe significant accounting policies of our Company, which are summarized below, are consistent with U.S. GAAP and reflect practices appropriate to the business in which we operate.Use of estimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented. Estimates include, but are not limited to, the establishment of reserves for accounts receivable, sales returns, inventory obsolescence and warranty claims; the useful lives for property, equipment, and intangible assets; and stock-based compensation. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with the determination of the fair value of financial instruments and evaluation of long-lived assets for impairment requires considerable judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could be  prior year amounts have been reclassified within the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto, to be consistent with current year presentation.Basis of presentationThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and, until its disposition, its subsidiary, EFLS in Solon, Ohio, and, until its disposition, its former subsidiary, CLL, and its subsidiary, Energy Focus Europe, Ltd., each located in the United Kingdom. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. On August 4, 2015, we entered into a Share Sale Agreement with John Harris, the managing director of CLL, pursuant to which Mr. Harris acquired CLL from us for nominal consideration. Additionally, during 2014, we shifted our focus away from providing turnkey solutions, we stopped accepting new projects, and during the third quarter of 2015, we completed our exit from this business. In 2013, we sold and discontinued our pool products business. Therefore, the results of operations and financial position of EFLS, CLL, and the pool products business are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as Discontinued operations and previously reported financial information for the current and prior years have been adjusted. Unless indicated otherwise, the information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements relates to our continuing operations43ENERGY FOCUS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSRevenue recognitionRevenue is recognized when it is realized or realizable, has been earned, and when all of the following have occurred:persuasive evidence or an arrangement exists e.g., a sales order, a purchase order, or a sales agreement,shipment has occurred, with the standard shipping term being F.O.B. ship point, or services provided on a proportional performance basis or installation have been completed,price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, andcollectability is reasonably assured.Revenues from sales of our products are generally recognized upon shipping based upon the following:all sales made by us to our customer base are non-contingent, meaning that they are not tied to that customers resale of products,standard terms of sale contain shipping terms of F.O.B. ship point, meaning that title and risk of loss is transferred when shipping occurs, andthere are no automatic return provisions that allow the customer to return the product in the event that the product does not sell within a defined timeframe.Revenues from research and development contracts are recognized primarily on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Deferred revenue is recorded for the excess of contract billings over the amount of contract costs and profits. Costs in excess of billings, included in prepaid and other assets, are recorded for contract costs in excess of contract billings.We warrant our products against defects or workmanship issues. We set up allowances for estimated returns, discounts and warranties upon recognition of revenue, and these allowances are adjusted periodically to reflect actual and anticipated returns, discounts and warranty expenses. These allowances are based on past history and historical trends, and contractual terms. The distributors obligations to us are not contingent upon the resale of our products and as such do not prohibit revenue recognition.Cash and cash equivalentsWe consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At December31, 2015and 2014, we had $346 millionand $74 million, respectively, in cash on deposit with financial institutions located in the United States, of which $113 thousandand $105 thousand, respectively was designated as restricted cash and relates to funds to be used exclusively for a research and development project with the National Shipbuilding Research Program. Additionally, our cash balance at December31, 2014included $300 thousandof the purchase price from the sale of our pool products business in escrow to secure our obligations of the sale, subject to the resolution of outstanding buyer claims. At December 31, 2015, we offset the full escrow amount by the expected costs to settle such claims as we have reached an agreement in principle with the buyer with respect to such settlement and the parties are working toward a written settlement agreement.InventoriesWe state inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost determined using the first-in-first-out method or market value. We establish provisions for excess and obsolete inventories after evaluation of historical sales, current economic trends, forecasted sales, product lifecycles, and current inventory levels. Due to the introduction of new products and technological advancements, charges to cost of sales for excess and obsolete inventories from continuing operations amounted to $15 million, $95 thousand, and $109 thousandin 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Please refer to Note 4, Inventories, for additional information.Accounts receivableOur customers are concentrated in the United States. In the normal course of business, we extend unsecured credit to our customers related to the sale of our services and products. Typical credit terms require payment within 30to 60days from the date of delivery or service. We evaluate and monitor the creditworthiness of each customer on a case-by-case basis. We also provide allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts based on our continuing evaluation of our customers ongoing 44ENERGY FOCUS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSrequirements and credit risk. We write-off accounts receivable when we deem that they have become uncollectible and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts. We do not generally require collateral from our customers.Income taxesAs part of the process of preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business. This process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as deferred revenues, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We then assess the likelihood that these deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent that we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be recovered, or is unknown, we establish a valuation allowance.Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets. At December31, 2015and 2014, we had a full valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the United States due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward. The valuation allowance is based upon our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable.At December31, 2015, we had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $691 millionfor federal, state, and local income tax purposes. However, due to changes in our capital structure, approximately $148 millionof this amount is available after the application of IRC Section 382 limitations. As a result of this limitation, in 2016, we only expect to have approximately $60 millionof the net operating loss carry-forward available for use. If not utilized, these carry-forwards will begin to expire in 2021for federal purposes, and have begun to expire for state and local purposes. Please refer to Note 12, Income Taxes, for additional information.Collateralized assetsDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, $10 millionof cash collateral related to our surety bonding program associated with EFLS was refunded to us by the surety carrier, as it was determined that the collateral was no longer needed.Fair value measurementsFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are measured on a recurring or non-recurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs.We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of available market information and generally accepted valuation methodologies. We assess the inputs used to measure fair value using a three-tier hierarchy. The hierarchy indicates the extent to which pricing inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Level 1 inputs include unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities and are the most observable. Level 2 inputs include unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities that are either directly or indirectly observable, or other observable inputs such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity rates, and yield curves. Level 3 inputs are not observable in the market and include our own judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.The carrying amounts of certain financial instruments including cash and equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and credit line borrowings approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Based on borrowing rates currently available to us for loans with similar terms, the carrying value of long-term debt obligations also approximates fair value.Long-lived assetsProperty and equipment are stated at cost and include expenditures for additions and major improvements. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. We use the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the related assets generally 2to 15years for financial reporting purposes. Accelerated methods of depreciation are used for federal income tax purposes. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated 45ENERGY FOCUS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSdepreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Refer to Note 5, Property and Equipment, for additional information.Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that would result in an impairment review primarily include operations reporting losses, a significant change in the use of an asset, or the planned disposal or sale of the asset. The asset would be considered impaired when the future net undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset are less than its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, as determined by quoted market prices if available or the present value of expected future cash flows. On December 31, 2013, we recorded an impairment charge of $608 thousandfor assets that were held for sale at December 31, 2013. These assets were subsequently sold in the first quarter of 2014 for $130 thousand, which was the carrying value after the impairment charge. See Note 5, Property and Equipment, for additional information.Certain risks and concentrationsWe sell our products through a combination of direct sales employees, independent sales representatives, and distributors in different geographic markets throughout the world. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. Although we maintain allowances for potential credit losses that we believe to be adequate, a payment default on a significant sale could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.We have certain customers whose net sales individually represented 10 percent or more of our total net sales, or whose net trade accounts receivable balance individually represented 10 percent or more of our total net trade accounts receivable, as follows:For 2015, LED Lighting Solutions Global, LLC an affiliate of Energy Management Products, LLC LLS and Atlantic Diving Supply, Inc. ADS accounted for 59 percentand 16 percentof net sales, respectively, and together with the Naval Surface Warfare Centers and DFAS Columbus comprised sales of products for the U.S. Navy totaling approximately 80 percentof net sales.For 2014, LLS and DFAS Columbus accounted for approximately 64 percentand 10 percentof net sales, respectively, and together comprised sales of products for the U.S. Navy totaling approximately 74 percentof net sales.For 2013, DFAS Columbus and the Ohio Department of Development accounted for approximately 30 percentand 10 percentof net sales, respectively.At December31, 2015, ADS accounted for 62 percentof net trade receivables. At December31, 2014, LLS, ES Entegral Solutions, Inc. and Johnson Controls, Inc. accounted for approximately 55 percent, 20 percent, and 10 percentof net trade accounts receivable, respectively.We require substantial amounts of purchased materials from selected vendors. With specific materials, all of our purchases are from a single vendor. Substantially all of the materials we require are in adequate supply. However, the availability and costs of materials may be subject to change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, suppliers allocation to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, and changes in exchange rates and worldwide price and demand levels. Our inability to obtain adequate supplies of materials for our products at favorable prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, or results of operations by decreasing our profit margins and by hindering our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis.Product developmentProduct development expenses include salaries, contractor and consulting fees, supplies and materials, as well as costs related to other overhead items such as depreciation and facilities costs. Research and development costs are expensed as they are incurred.Net income lossper shareBasic income loss per share is computed by dividing the net income loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted income loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of incremental shares upon exercise of stock options and warrants, unless the effect would be anti-dilutive46ENERGY FOCUS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe following table presents a reconciliation of basic and diluted income loss per share computations in thousands, except per share amounts:For the year ended December  loss from continuing  income from discontinued  income  weighted average common shares  common shares from options and warrants339Diluted weighted average shares10,7527,8164,779As a result of the net loss we incurred for the years ended December31, 2014and 2013, options, warrants and convertible securities representing approximately 818,832and 1,955,809shares of common stock were excluded from the loss per share calculation, respectively, because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.Stock-based compensationWe recognize compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value under the authoritative guidance. Management applies the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value stock options issued to employees and directors, and applies judgment in estimating key assumptions that are important elements of the model in expense recognition. These elements include the expected life of the option, the expected stock-price volatility, and expected forfeiture rates. Compensation expense is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. See Note 11, Stockholders Equity, for additional information. Common stock, stock options, and warrants issued to non-employees that are not part of an equity offering are accounted for under the applicable guidance under ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees, and are generally re-measured at each reporting date until the awards vest.Foreign currency translationUntil its disposition, our international subsidiary used its local currency as its functional currency. Assets and liabilities were translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense accounts were translated at average exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments were recorded directly to Accumulated other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity. With the sale of CLL in August 2015, the translation adjustments recorded within the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity were reclassified and are recorded as a component of the Loss on disposal of discontinued operations within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 3, Discontinued Operations, for additional information.Advertising expensesAdvertising expenses are charged to operations in the period incurred. They consist of costs for the placement of our advertisements in various media and the costs of demos provided to potential distributors of our products. Advertising expenses from continuing operationswere $695 thousand, $214 thousand, and $82 thousandfor the years ended December31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.Shipping and handling costsWe include shipping and handling revenues in net sales, and shipping and handling costs in cost of sales47ENERGY FOCUS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSProduct warrantiesWe warrant finished goods against defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for periods generally between oneand five years. Settlement costs consist of actual amounts expensed for warranty coverage, which are largely a result of the cost of replacement products. A liability for the estimated future costs under product warranties is maintained for products outstanding under warranty and is included in Accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The warranty activity for the respective years is as follows in thousands:At December 31,20152014Balance at the beginning of the year$81$75Accruals for warranties issued25549Settlements made during the year in cash or in kind2243Accrued warranty expense$314$81Recent accounting standards and pronouncementsIn November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes Topic 740: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires entities to present deferred tax assets DTAs and deferred tax liabilities DTLs as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. This presentation simplifies the current guidance, which requires entities to separately present DTAs and DTLs as current or noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The netting of DTAs and DTLs by tax jurisdiction is still required under the new guidance. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our disclosures as a result of the full valuation allowance we have recorded against our DTAs.In September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business CombinationsTopic 805. The amendments in this ASU require that an acquiring company recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Additionally, this ASU requires an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, the amendments in this ASU eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. This ASU is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the guidance in this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory Topic 330, which requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This measure simplifies the current guidance, which requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market, where market is defined as one of three different measures, including net realizable value. The ASU does not apply to inventories measured by using either the last-in, first-out method or the retail inventory method. The ASU is effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the standard.In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on the Company48ENERGY FOCUS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05,Customer Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement, which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The guidance will not change U.S. GAAP for a customer accounting for service contracts. The amendments in the update are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on the Company.In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, Income Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual Items Subtopic 225-20: Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items,which provides guidance on simplifying income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items from U.S. GAAP. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively and retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We have evaluated the accounting guidance and determined that there is no impact of this update to our consolidated financial statements.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-9, Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all of the existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption is permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with CustomerTopic 606: Deferral of the Effective Date. This ASU defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customer Topic 606 for all entities by one year. As a result, all entities will be required to apply the provisions of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently assessing the adoption date and impact the guidance in this ASU will have, if any, on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08,Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations while enhancing disclosures in this area. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations. Those strategic shifts should have a major effect on the organizations operations and financial results. Examples include a disposal of a major geographic area, a major line of business, or a major equity method investment. Additionally, the new guidance requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide financial statement users with more information about the assets, liabilities, income, expenses of discontinued operations and of the pretax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of an organization that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014. We have evaluated and adopted the accounting guidance with respect to our dispositions of EFLS and CLL.NOTE 3.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSEFLSAs part of the strategy to align our resources with developing and selling our energy-efficient LED products into thecommercial and military maritime markets, we completed the exit of our turnkey solutions business, operated by EFLS during the third quarter of 2015. During 2014, we shifted our focus away from the turnkey solutions business. We stopped accepting new projects and completed all outstanding solutions-based projects in the first quarter of 2015. As of September 30, 2015, the exit of our turnkey solutions business was complete. Accordingly, the operating results related to EFLS have been included as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. There were no assets disposed as a result of the disposition, and we did not recognize a gain or loss on disposal or record an income tax expense or benefit. We do not anticipate any significant continuing involvement related to this discontinued operation.CLLIn August 2015, we sold our wholly-owned United Kingdom subsidiary, CLL. The sale was for nominal consideration under the terms of the agreement. As a result of the transaction and the elimination of this foreign subsidiary consolidated under the equity method of accounting, we recorded a one-time loss of $44 thousand, which included a $469 thousandaccumulated other comprehensive income reclassification adjustment for foreign currency translation adjustments. The loss was recorded in the 49Consolidated Statements of Operations under the caption Loss on disposal of discontinued operations. We do not anticipate any significant continuing involvement related to this discontinued operation.Pool Products BusinessOn November 26, 2013, we announced the sale of our pool products business for a cash purchase price of $52 million. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we sold substantially all of the assets associated with the pool products business and the buyer assumed certain related liabilities. In connection with the sale, we and the buyer entered into a transition services agreement that continued until April 30, 2014, under which we provided services to transition the pool products business to the buyer. In addition, the Purchase Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants of us and the buyer and prohibits us from competing with the buyer in the pool business for a period of five years following the closing. The Purchase Agreement also provided for an escrow of $500 thousandof the purchase price to secure customary indemnification obligations with respect to our representations, warranties, covenants and other obligations under the Purchase Agreement. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the first of five $100 thousandscheduled escrow releases commenced on March 25, 2014, and was to continue on the 25th day of each of the next foursubsequent months. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, $200 thousandof the cash held in escrow had been released to us and $300 thousandremained in escrow subject to the resolution of outstanding buyer claims that were the subject of an arbitration claim filed by the buyer in February 2015. The legal fees incurred for the arbitration are included in the loss on disposal of discontinued operations. For more information on the status of the remaining cash in escrow, please refer to Note 15, Legal Matters.As a result of exiting EFLS and selling CLL and the pool products businesses, we have eliminated all net sales and expenses associated with this business from the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and have reported the net loss income from those activities as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all years presented.The following table shows the components included in assets and liabilities of discontinued operations within the Consolidated Balance Sheets in thousands:December 31, 2014EFLSCLLTotalCash and cash equivalents$93$4$97Trade accounts  and other current assets795102Current assets of discontinued operations4126581,070Property and equipment, net2323Other assets5050Non-current assets of discontinued operations7373Total assets of discontinued  payable$163$318$481Accrued liabilities73362435Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts2323Current liabilities of discontinued operations259680939Total liabilities of discontinued operations$259$680$939The following table summarizes the components included in loss from discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods presented in thousands:50December 31,201520142013Net sales$1,078$6,262$16,564Cost of sales5884,69012,254Gross Profit4901,5724,310Operating expenses of discontinued operations6573,0794,746Other expenses income6468Loss gain on disposal of discontinued  gain from discontinued operations before income  from provision for income taxes1021Loss gain from discontinued  following table shows the components of the loss from discontinued operations by business for the periods presented in thousands:December  products business20672Loss gain from discontinued  products business490303,915Loss gain on disposal of discontinued  gain from discontinued operations before income  from provision for income taxes1021Loss gain from discontinued  are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost determined using the first-in, first-out cost method or market and consists of the following in thousands:At December 31,20152014Raw materials$4,577$2,987Finished goods4,5774,187Reserve for excess, obsolete, and slow moving  net$7,732$6,86951NOTE 5.PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENTProperty and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets and consist of the following in thousands:At December 31,20152014Equipment useful life 3 - 15 years$2,864$1,289Tooling useful life 2 - 5 years851851Vehicles useful life 5 years39Furniture and fixtures useful life 5 years10485Computer software useful life 3 years581378Leasehold improvements the shorter of useful life or lease life509509Construction in progress31018Property and equipment at cost5,2583,130Less: accumulated  and equipment, net$2,429$456Depreciation expense was $266 thousand, $184 thousand, and $615 thousandfor the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively.NOTE 6.

The total loan amount available to us under the line of credit was equal to 85 percentof our net, eligible receivables, plus available inventory 50 percentof the lower of cost or market value of eligible inventory, or $250 thousand, whichever was less. The credit facility was secured by a lien on our domestic assets. The interest rate for borrowing on accounts receivable was 85 percent, on inventories 10 percent, and on overdrafts 13 percent. Additionally, there was an annual 1 percentfacility fee on the entire $45 millionamount of the credit facility payable at the beginning of the year. The agreement automatically renewed from year to year after December 31, 2014, unless we provided the requisite notice to Rosenthal. Additionally, Rosenthal had the right to terminate the agreement by providing 60days written notice to us. We provided the required advance 52notice to Rosenthal, and as such, the facility was terminated in December 2015. We were required to comply with certain financial covenants, measured quarterly, including, as defined in the agreement: a tangible net worth amount and a working capital amount. We were in compliance with the financial covenants as of December 31, 2014. Borrowings under the revolving line of credit were $453 thousandat December 31, 2014, and are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a current liability under the caption Credit line borrowings.BorrowingsThe components of our debt at December 31, 2014 are presented in the table below in thousands:December 31,2014Unsecured promissory note - Quercus Trust$70Long-term debt$70On June 1, 2009, we entered into a $70 thousandunsecured promissory note with Quercus Trust that bears interest in the amount of 1 percentper year. The principal and accrued interest on the note are due on June 1, 2109. In December 2015, we entered into an agreement with Quercus Trust to cancel the note and the accrued interest for a single payment of $13 thousandin cash. At the time of the cancellation, we had recorded $5 thousandin accrued interest on this note. For the year ended December31, 2015, we recognized a gain of $62 thousandwithin Other income within the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a result of this cancellation.Effective on March 31, 2014, the holders of the unsecured convertible notes converted the outstanding principal amount of $615 millioninto 2,671,739shares of our common stock.

At December 31, 2014, all of the additional interest had been paid to the note holders. In relation to the conversion of the outstanding notes, we incurred a one-time charge of $27 million, including a non-cash charge of $23 millionto write-off the remaining unamortized discount associated with the notes, $154 thousandfor the additional six months interest and $293 thousandto write-off the remaining loan origination costs incurred in connection with the convertible notes.NOTE 8.RESTRUCTURINGDuring the third quarter of 2013, we relocated our manufacturing operations from a contract manufacturing facility located in Mexico to our facilities located in Pleasanton, California and Solon, Ohio. The Consolidated Statements of Operations include $80 thousandin Restructuring costs incurred for severance paid to Mexican contract employees as required by the production share agreement, as amended, between us and the contract manufacturer.

Energy Focus, Inc., et al., alleging wrongful termination and other claims related to his employment with us. We subsequently removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. On May 1, 2015, we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiff, which assigned no culpability to any party and provided for a payment by us in exchange for full settlement and release of his claims. As of June 30, 2015, the total settlement amount of $330 thousandhad been paid to the plaintiff. In September 2015, we received $174 thousandas reimbursement from our insurance company for the settlement claim.

We sold 1,500,000shares of our common stock at a purchase price to the public of $1700per share and the Selling Stockholders sold an additional 1,500,000shares of our common stock on the same terms and conditions.The offering closed on September 16, 2015 and we received $236 millionin net proceeds from the transaction, after giving effect to underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses. We expect to use the net proceeds from the offering to finance our growth efforts, for working capital, and other general corporate purposes.Public offeringOn August 6, 2014, we announced the pricing of a public offering to sell 1,175,000shares of our common stock at a price of $450per share to the public. The underwriters for the offering were given an option to purchase up to an additional 176,250shares at $450per share to cover over allotments. On August 8, 2014, they exercised their option to purchase the 176,250additional shares. The offering closed on August 11, 2014. The net proceeds we received from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses paid by us, were $515 million, including the underwriters exercise of the overallotment.As part of the underwriting agreement, we issued a warrant for 47,000shares to the underwriter representing four percentof the number of shares of common stock sold in the offering at an issue price of $540per share representing 120 percentof the public offering price of the shares of common stock. In conjunction with the registered offering, our common stock began trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market NASDAQ under the symbol EFOI on August 7, 2014. The warrant was exercised on September 10, 2015.Convertible debtBetween the fourth quarter of 2012 and October of 2013, we entered into unsecured convertible notes totaling $76 million. The notes were convertible into shares of our common stock at $230per share at various dates beginning on April 2013 through February 2014. As of March 31, 2014, all of the convertible debt had been converted into 3,323,913shares of our common stock.WarrantsWe have issued warrants in conjunction with various equity issuances, debt financing arrangements, and sales incentives.

The 2014 Plan was approved by the stockholders at our annual meeting on July 15, 2014, after which no further awards could be issued under the Energy Focus, Inc. 2008 Incentive Stock Plan the 2008 Plan. The 2014 Plan allows for awards up to 600,000shares of common stock and expires on July 15, 2024. On July 22, 2015, the stockholders approved an amendment to the 2014 Plan to increase the shares available for issuance under the 2014 Plan by an additional 600,000shares. We have twoother equity-based compensation plans under which options are currently outstanding; however, no new awards may be granted under these plans. Generally, stock options are granted at fair market value and expire ten yearsfrom the grant date. Employee grants generally vest in threeor fouryears, while grants to non-employee directors generally vest in oneyear. The specific terms of each grant are determined by our Board of Directors. At December 31, 2015, 795,169shares remain available to grant under the 2014 Plan.In November 2013, as a result of the sale of the pool products business, our Board of Directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of 7,000options with a grant price of $230per share for those employees who were being terminated as part of the sale. Additionally, the period in which these grants could be exercised was extended from threemonths from the date of termination to oneyear.We granted 5,122restricted stock units during the third quarter of 2013; however, 1,463were forfeited in 2013 and 2,439were forfeited in 2014. The remaining 1,220shares vested in July of 2014. The fair market value on the date of grant was $410per share, and the shares vested oneyear from the grant date56Stock-based compensation expense is attributed to the granting of stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock unit awards. For all stock-based awards, we recognize compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method.The impact on our results for stock-based compensation was as follows in thousands:For the year ended December 31,201520142013Cost of sales$38$14$5Product development37828Selling, general, and administrative738510168Total stock-based compensation$813$532$201At December31, 2015and 2014, we had unearned stock compensation expense of $992 thousandand $387 thousand, respectively. These costs will be charged to expense and amortized on a straight-line basis in subsequent periods. The remaining weighted average period over which the unearned compensation is expected to be amortized was approximately 19and 26years as of December31, 2015and 2014, respectively.Stock optionsThe fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Estimates utilized in the calculation include the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate, and expected volatility, and are further comparatively detailed as follows:201520142013Fair value of options issued$533$362$215Exercise price$723$469$299Expected life of option in years58577Risk-free interest rate17%18%14%Expected  yield000%000%000%The estimated expected life of the option is calculated based on contractual life of the option, the vesting life of the option, and historical exercise patterns of vested options. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected life of the option. The volatility estimates are calculated using historical volatility of our stock price calculated over a period of time representative of the expected life of the option. We have not paid dividends in the past, and do not expect to pay dividends over the corresponding expected term as of the grant date57Options outstanding under all plans at December31, 2015have a contractual life of tenyears, and vesting periods between oneand fouryears. A summary of option activity under all plans was as follows:Number  PricePer ShareOutstanding at December 31,  at December 31,  at December 31,  at December 31, 2015602,207$858Vested and expected to vest at December 31, 2015565,137$871Exercisable at December 31, 2015304,610$938The Expected to Vest options are the unvested options that remain after applying the pre-vesting forfeiture rate assumption to total unvested options. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2015 was $485 thousand. The total intrinsic value of options outstanding and options exercisable at December 31, 2015 was $42 millionand $23 million, respectively, which was calculated using the closing stock price at the end of the year of $1375per share less the option price of the in-the-money grants.The options outstanding at December31, 2015have been segregated into ranges for additional disclosure as follows:OPTIONS OUTSTANDINGOPTIONS EXERCISABLERange ofExercise PricesNumber of Shares OutstandingWeighted Average Remaining Contractual Life in yearsWeighted Average Exercise PriceNumber of Shares ExercisableWeighted Average Remaining Contractual Life in yearsWeighted Average Exercise  and Restricted Stock UnitsPrior to 2011, we issued restricted stock to Executive Officers and Directors in lieu of paying a portion of their cash compensation or Directors fees.

The 2013 Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to the lower of 85 percentof the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning or end of the offering period. Employees may end their participation at any time during the offering period, and participation ends automatically upon termination of employment with us. During 2015, 2014and 2013, employees purchased 18,119, 9,932, and 17,655shares, respectively. At December31, 2015, 465,535shares remained available for purchase under the 2014 Plan.NOTE 12. INCOME TAXESWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, as well as in various state and local jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, and local, or non-United States income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2012. Our practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense when and if they become applicable. At December31, 2015and 2014, respectively, there were noaccrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.The following table shows the components of income loss from continuing operations before income taxes in thousands:For the year ended December 31,201520142013United  loss from continuing operations before income  following table shows the components of the provision for income taxes from continuing operations in thousands:For the year ended December 31,201520142013Current:U.S. federal$123$$State26Provision for income taxes$149$$The principal items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U.S. statutory rate and the provision for income taxes from continuing operations reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations are as follows:For the year ended December 31,201520142013U.S. statutory rate340%340%340%State taxes net of federal tax benefit021005Valuation  amortization  tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets are as follows in thousands:At December 31,201520142013Allowance for doubtful accounts$18$11$15Accrued expenses and other reserves2,2442,0821,960Tax credits, deferred RD, and other1224487Net operating loss5,3846,8713,989Valuation  deferred tax assets Our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance as a result of the utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards. We utilized $62 millionof federal our net operating loss carry-forward in 2015. Since we believe it is more likely than not that the benefit from net operating loss carry-forwards will not be realized, we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2015and 2014, respectively. We had nonet deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2015or 2014, respectively. There was nofederal tax expense for 2014 or 2013, due to an increase to the valuation allowance. In 2015, we recognized Federal tax expense as a result of the alternative minimum tax.Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. In considering the need for a valuation allowance, we assess all evidence, both positive and negative, available to determine whether all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Such evidence includes, but is not limited to, recent earnings history, projections of future income or loss, reversal patterns of existing taxable and deductible temporary differences, and tax planning strategies. We will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis60At December31, 2015, we had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $691 millionfor U.S. federal, state, and local income tax purposes. However, due to changes in our capital structure, approximately $148 millionof this amount is available to offset future taxable income after the application of the limitations found under Section 382 of the IRC. As a result of this limitation, in 2016, we only expect to have approximately $60 millionof the net operating loss carry-forward available for use. If not utilized, these carry-forwards will begin to expire in 2021for federal purposes and in 2021or sooner for state and local purposes. Additionally, the changes to our capital structure have subjected, and will continue to subject our net operating loss carry-forward to an annual limitation as discussed further below. This limitation will significantly restrict our ability to utilize the carry-forward to offset taxable income in future periods.The IRC imposes restrictions on the utilization of various carry-forward tax attributes in the event of a change in ownership, as defined by IRC Section 382. During 2015, we completed an IRC Section 382 review and the results of this review indicate ownership changes have occurred which would cause a limitation on the utilization of carry-forward attributes. Our gross capital loss carry-forwards, net operating loss carry-forwards, and research and development credits are all subject to limitation. Under these tax provisions, the limitation is applied first to any capital losses, next to any net operating losses, and then to any general business credits. The Section 382 limitation is currently estimated to result in the expiration of $543 millionof net operating loss carry-forwards and $299 thousandof research and development credits. A valuation allowance has been established to reserve for the potential benefits of the capital loss carry-forwards and the remaining net operating loss carry-forwards in the consolidated financial statements to reflect the uncertainty of future taxable income required to utilize available tax loss carry-forwards.NOTE 13.PRODUCT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATIONDuring 2013, we sold our pool products business. During 2014, we shifted our focus away from the turnkey solutions business to align our resources with developing and selling our LED products and completed our exit of that business in September 2015. With the exit from EFLS and sale of CLL, we have aligned our resourced and focused our efforts on the sale of LED lighting products, in particular our military and commercial tubular LED TLED lines of products, into targeted vertical markets. Our products are sold primarily in the United States through a combination of direct sales employees, independent sales representatives and distributors. We currently operate in a single industry segment, developing and selling our energy-efficient light-emitting diode LED lighting products into the military maritime, and general commercial and industrial markets.

On December 23, 2015, we terminated the Agreement with Communal without penalty. NOTE 15.LEGALMATTERSAs to matters in which the loss is not considered both probable and estimable, or is considered probable but not estimable, we do not establish an accrual in accordance with current accounting guidance. We are unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for matter described below, since the proceeding is at a stage where significant uncertainty exists as to legal or factual issues and as to whether such matters will proceed to a final arbitration. Based on currently available information, it is possible that a negative outcome could have a material impact on our results for the period in which it occurs and, if applicable, our financial position, results of operations or cash flow in general.On November 26, 2013, we announced the sale of our pool products business for a cash purchase price of $52 million. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we sold substantially all of the assets associated with the pool products business and the buyer assumed certain related liabilities. The Purchase Agreement provided for an escrow of $500 thousandof the purchase price to secure customary indemnification obligations with respect to our representations, warranties, covenants and other obligations under the Purchase Agreement. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the first of five $100 thousandscheduled escrow releases commenced on March 25, 2014, and was to continue on the 25th day of each of the next foursubsequent months. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, $200 thousandof the cash held in escrow had been released to us and $300 thousandremained in escrow subject to the resolution of outstanding buyer claims. The Purchase Agreement provides that all disputes related to the sale must be resolved through binding arbitration. On February 18, 2015, the buyer filed a claim with the American Arbitration Association AAA asserting claims for damages of $780 thousandunder the Purchase Agreement and relating to product development, which was amended on September 1, 2015 to assert damages of $16 million. We believe the claims are without merit and asserted a counterclaim in the arbitration for the $300 thousandthat still remains in escrow. The arbitration process is continuing and we are unable to predict the outcome, however, we have reached an agreement in principle with the buyer to settle the claim for the amount of the escrow fund and the parties are working toward a written settlement agreement.In addition to the matter described above, in the ordinary course of business, we may become involved in lawsuits and administrative proceedings. Some of these proceedings may result in fines, penalties, or judgments which, from time to time, may have an impact on its business and financial condition. Although the outcome of such lawsuits or other proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any uninsured ultimate liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its liquidity, financial position, or results of operations62SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO ITEM 8.The following table sets forth our selected unaudited financial information for the four quarters in the periods ended December31, 2015and 2014, respectively.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of disclosure controls and proceduresWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable assurance standards. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. Any design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Report on Form 10-K, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2015.Managements report on internal controls over financial reportingThe management of Energy Focus, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15f. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based upon criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO Framework.An effective internal control system, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention or overriding of controls; therefore, it can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to reliable financial reporting. Furthermore, effectiveness of an internal control system in future periods cannot be guaranteed, because the design of any system of internal controls is based in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events. There can be no assurance that any control design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, certain controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate. As such, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the COSO Framework as of December 31, 2014. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that there was a material weaknesses identified in our internal controls as of December 31, 2014. The material weaknesses related to a lack of effective controls over revenue recognition. Management developed and implementedcertain controls during 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 to remediate this identified material weakness, including additional review systems, standardized sales terms and conditions, and education and training. Management believes the material weakness was remediated in the first quarter of 2015.Based upon our evaluation under the COSO framework as of December 31, 2015, management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015.Changes in internal control over financial reportingDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, there were no material changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.AttestationReport  Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our independent public 64accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only managements report.
