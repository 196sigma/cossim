ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Evolving Systems,Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Evolving Systems,Inc. a Delaware corporation, the Company as of December31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2015. Evolving Systems,Inc.s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Evolving Systems,Inc. as of December31, 2015, and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. s/ FRIEDMAN LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization We are a provider of software solutions and services to the wireless, wireline and cable markets. We maintain long-standing relationships with many of the largest wireless, wireline and cable companies worldwide. Our customers rely on us to develop, deploy, enhance and maintain software solutions that provide a variety of service activation and provisioning functions. Our service activation solution, TertioTSA is used to activate bundles of voice, video and data services for wireless, wireline and cable network operators; our SIM card activation solution, Dynamic SIM Allocation TMDSA is used to dynamically allocate and assign resources to Mobile Network Operators MNOs devices that rely on SIM cards; our Mobile Data Enablement TMMDE solution provides a data consumption and policy management solution for wireless carriers and Mobile Virtual Network Operators MVNOs that monitor the usage and consumption of data services; our Total Number Management TNM product is a scalable and fully automated database solution that enables operators to reliably and efficiently manage their telephone numbers as well as other communication identifiers i.e. SIMs, MSISDNs,IMSIs,ICCIDs,IPs. Our solutions can be deployed on premise or offered as a Software-as-a-Service SaaS.
On September30, 2015 we announced the acquisition of privately held RateIntegration,Inc., d/b/a Sixth Sense Media SSM, a provider of real time analytics and marketing solutions to wireless carriers. SSMs software solution platform, Real-time Lifecycle Marketing RLM, enables carriers marketing departments to innovate, execute and manage highly-personalized and contextually-relevant, interactive campaigns that engage consumers in real time.
We believe the addition of SSMs RLM product to our existing service activation and data enablement products will produce a powerful platform for wireless carriers. A product suite which we refer to as our Mobile Marketing Solutions MMS will provide sophisticated, highly tailored mobile campaigns which can be executed based on critical subscriber data captured during the initial activation experience DSA and RLM as well as in-life subscriber usage via MDE. We see the opportunity to leverage our technology to provide MNOs with sophisticated mobile marketing campaigns that will extend beyond voice, text and data usage campaigns and provide marketing services that will assist MNOs to market services that include retail mobile marketing, gaming, streaming video as well as social media based campaigns.
Business Combination - On September30, 2015 we acquired SSM, now known as Evolving Systems NC. This business combination is reflected in these consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. Refer to Note 2, Acquisition, for more information regarding the acquisition.
We account for business combinations in accordance with the acquisition method. The acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their fair values on the date of a business acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Certain adjustments to the assessed fair values of the assets and liabilities made subsequent to the acquisition date, but within the measurement period, which is up to one year, are recorded as adjustments to goodwill. Any adjustments subsequent to the measurement period are recorded in income. Our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business from the completion date of an acquisition.
The judgments that we make in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact net income in periods following a business combination. We generally use either the income, cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions of such fair values and asset lives. The income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the asset, discounted to present value. The cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction cost. The market approach estimates value based on what other participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets. Although each valuation approach is considered in valuing the assets acquired, the approach ultimately selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of information.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Evolving Systems,Inc. and subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We made estimates with respect to revenue recognition for estimated hours to complete projects accounted for
39 Table of Contents
using the percentage-of-completion method, allowance for doubtful accounts, income tax valuation allowance, fair values of long-lived assets, valuation of intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives for property, equipment and intangible assets, business combinations, capitalization of internal software development costs and fair value of stock-based compensation amounts. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Foreign Currency Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of our foreign operations, generally, is the respective local currency for each foreign subsidiary. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations denominated in local currencies are translated at the spot rate in effect at the applicable reporting date. Our consolidated balance sheets are translated at the spot rate of exchange during the applicable period. Our consolidated statements of operations are translated at the weighted average rate of exchange during the applicable period. The resulting unrealized cumulative translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity. Realized and unrealized transaction gains and losses generated by transactions denominated in a currency different from the functional currency of the applicable entity are recorded in other income loss in the period in which they occur.
Goodwill - Goodwill is the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but tested for impairment annually or whenever indicators of impairment exist. These indicators may include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors. For purposes of the goodwill evaluation, we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying amount. If the carrying value of a reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, we would then compare the fair value of the reporting units goodwill to its carrying amount, and any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value would be charged to operations as an impairment loss.
Intangible Assets - Amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of purchased software and licenses, customer contracts and relationships, trademarks and tradenames, and business partnerships acquired in conjunction with our purchase of Evolving Systems Labs and Evolving Systems NC. These assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated lives.
We assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.
If we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and/or long-lived assets may not be recoverable, we compare the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition to the assets carrying amount. If an amortizable intangible or long-lived asset is not deemed to be recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss representing the excess of the assets carrying value over its estimated fair value.
Fair Value Measurements - Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
Cash and Cash Equivalents - All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.
Revenue Recognition - We recognize revenue when an agreement is signed, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue from two primary sources: license fees and services, and customer support. The majority of our license fees and services revenue is generated from fixed-price contracts, which provide for licenses to our software products and services to customize such software to meet our customers use. When the customization services are determined to be essential to the functionality of the delivered software, we recognize revenue using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. In these types of arrangements, we do not typically have vendor specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value on the license fee/services portion services are related to customizing the software of the arrangement due to the large amount of customization required by our customers; however, we do have VSOE for the warranty/maintenance services based on the renewal rate of the first year of maintenance in the arrangement. The license/services portion is recognized using the percentage-of-completion
40 Table of Contents
method of accounting and the warranty/maintenance services are separated based on the renewal rate in the contract and recognized ratably over the warranty or maintenance period. We estimate the percentage-of-completion for each contract based on the ratio of direct labor hours incurred to total estimated direct labor hours and recognize revenue based on the percent complete multiplied by the contract amount allocated to the license fee/services. Since estimated direct labor hours, and changes thereto, can have a significant impact on revenue recognition, these estimates are critical and we review them regularly. If the arrangement includes a customer acceptance provision, the hours to complete the acceptance testing are included in the total estimated direct labor hours; therefore, the related revenue is recognized as the acceptance testing is performed. Revenue is not recognized in full until the customer has provided proof of acceptance on the arrangement. Generally, our contracts are accounted for individually. However, when certain criteria are met, it may be necessary to account for two or more contracts as one to reflect the substance of the group of contracts. We record amounts billed in advance of services being performed as unearned revenue. Unbilled work-in-progress represents revenue earned but not yet billable under the terms of the fixed-price contracts. All such amounts are expected to be billed and collected within 12 months.
We may encounter budget and schedule overruns on fixed-price contracts caused by increased labor or overhead costs. We make adjustments to cost estimates in the period in which the facts requiring such revisions become known. We record estimated losses, if any, in the period in which current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs indicate a loss. If revisions to cost estimates are obtained after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of the interim or annual financial statements, we make adjustments to the interim or annual financial statements accordingly.
In arrangements where the services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered software, we recognize license revenue when a license agreement has been signed, delivery and acceptance have occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Where applicable, we unbundle and record as revenue fees from multiple element arrangements as the elements are delivered to the extent that VSOE of fair value of the undelivered elements exist. If VSOE for the undelivered elements does not exist, we defer fees from such arrangements until the earlier of the date that VSOE does exist on the undelivered elements or all of the elements have been delivered.
We recognize revenue from fixed-price service contracts using the proportional performance method of accounting, which is similar to the percentage-of-completion method described above. We recognize revenue from professional services provided pursuant to time-and-materials based contracts and training services as the services are performed, as that is when our obligation to our customers under such arrangements is fulfilled.
We recognize revenue from our MDE contracts based on the number of transactions per month multiplied by a factor based on a unique table for transaction volumes relating to each account.
We recognize customer support, including maintenance revenue, ratably over the service contract period. When maintenance is bundled with the original license fee arrangement, its fair value, based upon VSOE, is deferred and recognized during the periods when services are provided.
Stock-based Compensation - We account for stock-based compensation by applying a fair-value-based measurement method to account for share-based payment transactions with employees and directors. We record compensation costs associated with the vesting of unvested options on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense because we settle these obligations by issuing shares of our common stock instead of settling such obligations with cash payments. We use the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant. This model requires the use of estimates for expected term of the options and expected volatility of the price of our common stock.
Comprehensive Income - Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains, and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. Other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale.
Restricted Cash As of December31, 2015 we no longer had restricted cash. As of December31, 2013, we had $24,000 of restricted cash related to securing a letter of credit for our San Francisco, California lease which has since expired.
Contract Receivables, Unbilled Work-in-Progress and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Contract receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Credit is extended based on the evaluation of a customers financial condition and collateral is not required. Unbilled work in progress is revenue which has been earned but not invoiced. An allowance is placed against accounts receivable or unbilled work in progress for our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses. We determine the allowance based on historical write-off experience and information received during collection efforts. We review our allowances monthly and past due balances over 90 days are reviewed individually for collectability. Account balances are charged

against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers.

Long Term Deferred Revenue Long term deferred revenue are amounts which revenue will not be recognized within twelve months of the balance sheet date. As of December31, 2015 and 2014, we had $0 and $04 million, respectively, reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of contract receivables and unbilled work-in-progress. We perform on-going evaluations of customers financial condition and, generally, require no collateral from customers.
A substantial portion of our revenue is from a limited number of customers, all in the telecommunications industry.
For the year ended December31, 2015, no significant customer exceeded the threshold defined as contributing at least 10% of revenue from continuing operations. For the year ended December31, 2014, two significant customers accounted for 24% 13% and 11% of revenue from continuing operations. These customers are large telecommunications operators in Europe and Mexico. For the year ended December31, 2013 one significant customer accounted for 12% of revenue from continuing operations. This customer is a large telecommunications operator in Europe.
As of December31, 2015, two significant customers accounted for approximately 36% 25% and 11% of contract receivables and unbilled work-in-progress. These customers are large telecommunications operators in Africa and Europe. As of December31, 2014, three significant customers accounted for approximately 55% 26%, 16% and 13% of contract receivables and unbilled work-in-progress. These customers are large telecommunications operators in Africa, Mexico and Europe.
We are subject to concentration of credit risk with respect to our cash and cash equivalents, which we attempt to minimize by maintaining our cash and cash equivalents with institutions of sound financial quality. At times, cash balances may exceed limits federally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC.
Our funds not under any FDIC program were $73 million and $93 million as of December31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Sales, Use and Other Value Added Tax Revenue is recorded net of applicable state, use and other value added taxes.
Advertising and Promotion Costs Advertising and promotion costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs totaled approximately $01 million, $02 million and $02 million for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
Capitalization of Internal Software Development Costs We expend amounts on product development, particularly for new products and/or for enhancements of existing products. For internal development of software products that are to be licensed by us, we expense the cost of developing software prior to establishing technological feasibility and those costs are capitalized once technological feasibility has been established. Capitalization ceases upon general release of the software. The determination of whether internal software development costs are subject to capitalization is, by its nature, highly subjective and involves significant judgments. This decision could significantly affect earnings during the development period. Further, once capitalized, the software costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the product. The determination of the expected useful life of a product is highly judgmental. Finally, capitalized software costs must be assessed for impairment if facts and circumstances warrant such a review. We did not capitalize any internal software development costs during the three years ended December31, 2015. In addition, we did not have any capitalized internal software development costs included in our December31, 2015 and 2014 Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe that during these periods no material internal software development costs were required to be capitalized. Our conclusion is primarily based on the fact that the feature-rich, pre-integrated, and highly-scalable nature of our products requires that our development efforts include complex design, coding and testing methodologies, which include next generation software languages and development tools. Development projects of this nature carry a high degree of development risk. Substantially all of our internal software development efforts are of this nature, and therefore, we believe the period between achieving technological feasibility and the general release of the software to operations is so short that any costs incurred during this period are not material.
Property and Equipment and Long-Lived Assets Property and equipment are stated at cost or estimated fair value if acquired in an acquisition, less accumulated depreciation, and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, or the lease term, if shorter, using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization, and are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.
We review our long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of an asset or asset group by comparing its carrying amount to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, we recognize an impairment charge as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.
Income Taxes We record deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that these benefits will not be realized.
We use a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Topic 606. This Update affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets, unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards. The guidance in this Update supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to illustrate the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance also includes a cohesive set of disclosure requirements that will provide users of financial statements with comprehensive information about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a reporting organizations contracts with customers. This ASU is effective retrospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years beginning after December15, 2016 for public companies and 2017 for non-public entities, however the FASB has deferred the effective date by one year. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations.
43 Table of Contents
In August2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.Management of public and private companies will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the financial statements are issued or available to be issued when applicable and, if so, disclose that fact. Management will be required to make this evaluation for both annual and interim reporting periods, if applicable. The standard is effective for annual and interim periods ending after December15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to impact the consolidated financial statements.
In February2016, the FASB issued ASU No2016-02, Leases Topic 842, which requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets by recognizing a lessees rights and obligations, while expenses will continue to be recognized in a similar manner to todays legacy lease accounting guidance. This ASU could also significantly affect the financial ratios used for external reporting and other purposes, such as debt covenant compliance. This ASU will be effective for us on January1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 2 ACQUISITION
On September30, 2015 we acquired privately held RateIntegration,Inc. d/b/a Sixth Sense Media SSM, now known as Evolving Systems NC for an initial payment of approximately $975 million and a $05 million working capital adjustment. We also agreed to make a payment on the one year anniversary of the transaction of $250,000, with such payment being available to secure SSMs representations and warranties in the agreement.
We accounted for this business combination by applying the acquisition method, and accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the net assets and liabilities, approximately $69million, was recorded as goodwill. The Company is in the process of finalizing the purchase allocation, thus the provisional measures of deferred income taxes, intangibles and goodwill are subject to change. The Company expects the purchase price allocation will be finalized in 2016. The results of SSMs operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date.
We believe this acquisition complements our activation and SIM management products. Combining SSMs real-time analytics and campaign capabilities with our DSA and MDE solutions will allow the company to offer global wireless carriers solutions that utilize the highly valuable contextual data captured from the subscribers initial welcome experience via DSA, their network usage via RLM and their on-device app usage via MDE. The combined solutions will create a highly personalized experience that engages subscribers in real time from the first time subscribers power on their new devices right through their day-to-day usage.
Our strategic focus is primarily on the wireless markets in the areas of subscriber activation, SIM card management and activation, selfservice mobile applications, data enablement solutions, connected device activation, mobile marketing campaigns, advertising and analytics and management of services.

We recorded $46million in intangible assets as of the acquisition date with a weighted-average amortization period of approximately sevenyears and are amortizing the value of the trade name, technology, non-competition and customer relationships over an estimated useful life of 2, 8, 2 and 7years, respectively. We recorded $02 million of amortization expense related to the acquired intangible assets was recorded during the period ended December31, 2015.
The $54 million of goodwill was assigned to the license and service segment and $15 million was assigned to the customer support segment. The goodwill recognized is attributed primarily to expected synergies and the assembled workforce of SSM. As of the date of this report there were no changes in the recognized amounts of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of SSM.

Goodwill balances are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at period end. Adjustments related to foreign currency translation are included in other comprehensive income.
We performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of July31, 2015, which we had $170 million of goodwill included the following reporting units, License and Services LS US, Evolving Systems Labs of $11 million and Evolving Systems U.K. of $72 million and Customer Support CS UK of $87 million. The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using both market and income based approaches. Specifically, we incorporated observed market multiple data from selected guideline public companies and values arrived at through the application of discounted cash flow analyses which in turn were based upon our financial projections as of the valuation date. In our analysis, we weighted the application of discounted cash flow analysis at 70% and observed market multiple data from selected guideline public companies at 30%. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. If the carrying value of a reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, we would then be required to perform a second step of the impairment analysis which could lead to goodwill impairment should the carrying amount exceed the fair value. The excess of carrying amount over fair value would be charged to operations as an impairment loss. If the projected future performance of either of our segments as estimated in the income valuation approach is adjusted downward or is lower than expected in the future, we could be required to record a goodwill impairment charge. As a result of the first step of the 2015 goodwill impairment analysis, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Therefore the second step was not necessary. However, a hypothetical decrease of approximately 20% due to lower than estimated future cash flows in the estimated fair value of our LS-U.S. Evolving Systems Labs,Inc. reporting unit would result in its carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value and therefore require the second step, which could result in impairment for that reporting unit. From July31, 2015 through the date of this report, no events have occurred that we believe may have impaired goodwill.
As a result of the acquisition of SSM, $69 million of goodwill was acquired during the period, of which $54 million was assigned to the license and service segment and $15 million was assigned to the customer support segment.
We amortized identifiable intangible assets for Evolving Systems Labs and Evolving Systems NC on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives ranging from one to eight years. As of December31, 2015 and December31, 2014, identifiable intangibles were as follows in thousands

NOTE 5 REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT
On September28, 2015, we entered into the Third Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement with East West Bank to increase the current revolving credit facility from $50 million to $100 million the Revolving Facility. The additional $50 million Revolving Line II will bear interest at a floating rate equal to the U.S. Prime Rate plus 225%; the existing $50 million credit facility Revolving Line will continue to bear interest at the greater of 275% or the U.S. Prime Rate minus one half of one percent 050%. The Revolving Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of Evolving Systems, including a pledge, subject to certain limitations with respect to stock of foreign subsidiaries, of the stock of the existing and future direct subsidiaries of Evolving Systems. There is no mandated borrowing required against the Revolving Facility. To take an advance under the Revolving Facility, the Company must have a balance of $40 million in cash on deposit with East West Bank, a minimum current ratio and a specified ratio of Total Liabilities to Tangible Net Worth, which are both as defined in the Revolving Facility. The Revolving Facility requires the Company to pay a one-time credit facility fee of $10,000 for extension of Revolving Line II, an annual credit facility fee of $10,000 and monthly payments of interest, with the unpaid balance due on October22, 2016.
48 Table of Contents
The Revolving Facility includes negative covenants that place restrictions on the Companys ability to, among other things: restrict distributions to its shareholders in the aggregate amount not to exceed $18 million in any fiscal quarter, incur additional indebtedness; create liens or other encumbrances on assets; make loans, enter into letters of credit, guarantees, investments and acquisitions; sell or otherwise dispose of assets; cause or permit a change of control; merge or consolidate with another entity; make negative pledges; enter into affiliate transactions; and change the nature of its business materially. Outstanding amounts under the Revolving Facility may be accelerated by notice from East West Bank upon the occurrence and continuance of certain events of default, including without limitation: payment defaults, breach of covenants beyond applicable grace periods, breach of representations and warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, and the occurrence of a material adverse effect as defined. Acceleration is automatic upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy and insolvency defaults.
As of December31, 2015, we are in compliance with the covenants and have borrowed $100 million against the Revolving Facility. The proceeds from the borrowings against the facilities were used for the initial payment for the SSM acquisition agreement on September30, 2015.
Refer to Note 15, Subsequent Events, of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form10-K for information regarding the Fifth Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement with East West Bank.

As of December31, 2014, we had federal Net Operating Loss NOL carryforwards of approximately $23 million. As of December31, 2015 we had no NOL carryforwards remaining. As of December31, 2015 and 2014, we had state NOLs of approximately $174 million and $171 million, respectively. The state NOL carryforwards expire at various times beginning in 2018 and ending in 2033. In addition, we have research and experimentation credit carryforwards of approximately $03 million which may expire in 2018 and Alternative Minimum Tax AMT credits of $08 million which may expire at various times beginning in 2028 and ending in 2034.
In our U.S. Federal income tax returns we historically deducted income taxes paid to various countries. In our 2014 U.S. Federal income tax return we had $23 million of NOL carryforwards. Our income tax calculations have historically been under the regular and AMT regimes found in U.S. tax laws. The U.S. tax system contains rulesto alleviate the burden of double taxation on income generated in foreign countries and subject to tax in such countries. The U.S. allows for either a deduction or credit of such foreign taxes against U.S. taxable income. An election to either claim a deduction or credit on such foreign income taxes can be made

each tax year, independent from elections made in other years. A credit reduces a companys actual U.S. income tax on a dollar-for-dollar basis, while a deduction reduces only the companys income subject to tax. We made a comparison of our foreign dividends paid by our foreign subsidiary for which we deducted foreign taxes claimed versus claiming a Foreign Tax Credit FTC on the dividend paid by the foreign subsidiary. The dividends received were grossed-up with its corresponding foreign taxes. The U.S. law requires the offset of taxable income with NOL prior to applying the FTC rules. We determined it was beneficial for the company to gross-up the foreign dividends paid by the foreign subsidiary for the years 2012 through 2014 and make the election to claim a FTC. By doing so we fully utilized our December31, 2014, $23 million balance of the federal NOL. As a result, the company has approximately $28 million of FTCs to carryforward into 2015 and subsequent years as a deferred tax asset. In 2015, our deferred tax asset balance was increased by approximately $09 million of FTCs.
The Company uses the incremental approach to recognizing excess tax benefits associated with equity compensation. Our $23 million of federal NOLs are primarily windfall excess tax benefit related to stock compensation expense, the benefit of which, if realized, will be an increase to Additional Paid-in Capital APIC as opposed to a reduction in tax expense. Due to the aforementioned election to claim a FTC, during the year 2015 $08 million of the federal NOL was realized, with a corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows in thousands

In conjunction with the acquisition of Evolving Systems Labs in October2013, we recorded certain identifiable intangible assets. We established a deferred tax asset of $01 million at the acquisition date for the expected difference between what would be expensed for financial reporting purposes and what would be deductible for income tax purposes. In September2015, we established a deferred tax liability of $18 million as a result of the acquisition of Evolving Systems NC. As of December31, 2015 and 2014, there was a net deferred tax liability of $15 million and a net deferred tax asset of $02 million, respectively. This net deferred tax liability will be recognized as the identifiable intangibles are amortized.
We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on the domestic net deferred tax asset, with the exception of our FTC which has a partial valuation allowance, as we have determined it is more likely than not that we will not realize our domestic deferred
50 Table of Contents
tax assets. Such assets primarily consist of certain net state operating loss carryforwards, AMT credits and research and development credits. We assessed the realizability of our domestic deferred tax assets using all available evidence. In particular, we considered both historical results and projections of profitability for the reasonably foreseeable future periods. We are required to reassess our conclusions regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets at each financial reporting date. A future evaluation could result in a conclusion that all or a portion of the valuation allowance is no longer necessary which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.

The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it determines that it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.
As of December31, 2015 and 2014, we had no liability for unrecognized tax benefits. We do not believe there will be any material changes to our unrecognized tax positions over the next twelve months. Interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included as a component of income tax expense benefit in the accompanying statements of operations.
Our income taxes payable may be reduced by the AMT tax benefits from employee stock plan awards. We had no net excess tax benefits from employee stock plan awards for the years ended December31, 2015 and 2014, which would be reflected as an increase to additional paid-in capital.
We conduct business globally and, as a result, Evolving Systems Inc. or one or more of our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, namely the United Kingdom, Germany and India. Although carryovers can always be subject to review by taxing authorities, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2012.
During 2004, we formed Evolving Systems India, a wholly owned subsidiary of Evolving Systems which is used primarily for product development and customer service and support. The Company has the intent and current ability to indefinitely reinvest profits of Evolving Systems India for the year ended December31, 2015. Undistributed foreign earnings for the year ended December31, 2015 are approximately $10 million. Repatriation to the U.S. in the form of dividend distributions from the India controlled foreign subsidiary would give rise to taxation.
Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of certain tax attributes, including NOL and tax credit carryovers, available to be utilized following an Ownership Change triggered by a shift of greater than 50% in stock ownership over a three year testing period. We believe that SSM may have had one or more such Ownership Changes prior to its acquisition by Evolving Systems,Inc. However, the amount of the applicable limitation is not known, and has not been estimated at this time. Accordingly, because of this uncertainty, the Company has not recorded as part of its initial purchase accounting a deferred tax asset associated with the NOL carryforward of SSM. We intend to review the ownership history of SSM to determine the utilizable portion of its tax attributes as soon as practicable, and if appropriate, adjust the deferred tax assets and purchase accounting upon the conclusion of its assessment.
Two Indian subsidiaries of SSM, were acquired pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated September30, 2015. We have reason to believe there is uncertainty related to the lack of historical US International reporting for
51 Table of Contents
these two foreign subsidiaries, and are in the process of determining whether either or both of these subsidiaries are controlled foreign corporations CFCs within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code and related Regulations, or if a check-the-box election has taken place to effectively treat one or both of these subsidiaries as disregarded entities for US federal tax reporting purposes. The Company is in the process of obtaining pertinent information to assess the degree of uncertainty and to quantify related costs or liabilities.
NOTE 7 - STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY
Common Stock Dividends
Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $011 per share for each of the four quarters of 2015. There were no accrued dividends as of December31, 2015.
Any determination to declare a future quarterly dividend, as well as the amount of any cash dividend which may be declared, will be based on our financial position, earnings, earnings outlook and other relevant factors at that time, including applicable limits under our revolving credit facility or any other credit facility then in effect.
Treasury Stock
Beginning on May20, 2011, and continuing through December31, 2013, we had the ability through our stock purchase program to re-purchase our common stock at prevailing market prices either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions up to $50 million. The size and timing of such purchases, if any, was based on market and business conditions as well as other factors. We were not obligated to purchase any shares. The re-purchase program expired on December31, 2013.
From the inception of the plan through December31, 2013, we purchased 178,889 shares of our common stock for $13 million or an average price of $697 per share.
Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions/Agreements with Stockholders
Our restated certificate of incorporation allows the board of directors to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. Issuance of preferred stock, while providing desired flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. As of December31, 2015 and December31, 2014, no shares of preferred stock were outstanding.
In addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section203 of Delaware General Corporation Law which prohibit us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of threeyears after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in the prescribed manner. The application of Section203 may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control of our management, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock by discouraging or preventing takeover attempts that might result in the payment of a premium price to our stockholders.
NOTE 8 SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
We account for stock-based compensation by applying a fair-value-based measurement method to account for share-based payment transactions with employees and directors, and record compensation cost for all stock awards granted after January1, 2006 and awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after that date, using the modified prospective method. We record compensation costs associated with the vesting of unvested options on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. We recognized $03 million, $04 million and $03 million for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, of compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations, with respect to our stock-based compensation plans.

Stock Option/Incentive Plans
In January1996, our stockholders approved an Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan the Option Plan. Under the Option Plan, as amended, 4,175,000 shares were reserved for issuance. Options issued under the Option Plan were at the discretion of the Board of Directors, including the vesting provisions of each stock option granted. Options were granted with an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant, generally vest over four years and expire no more than ten years from the date of grant. The Option Plan terminated on January18, 2006; options granted before that date were not affected by the plan termination. At December31, 2015 and 2014, no options remained and 01 million options remained outstanding under the Option Plan, respectively.
In June2007, our stockholders approved the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan the 2007 Stock Plan with a maximum of 1,000,000 shares reserved for issuance. In June2010, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2007 Stock Plan which increased the maximum shares that may be awarded under the plan to 1,250,000. In June2013, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2007 Stock Plan which increased the maximum shares that may be awarded under the plan to 1,502,209. In June2015, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2007 Stock Plan which increased the maximum shares that may be awarded under the plan to 2,002,209. Awards permitted under the 2007 Stock Plan include: Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards. Awards issued under the 2007 Stock Plan are at the discretion of the Board of Directors. As applicable, awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant, generally vest over four years for employees and one year for directors and, with respect to stock option grants expire no more than ten years from the date of grant. At December31, 2015 and 2014, there were approximately 03 million and 01 million shares, respectively, available for grant under the 2007 Stock Plan. Of the shares available as of December 31, 2015, 02 million shares were reserved for acquisitions. At December31, 2015 and 2014, 08 million and 06 million options were issued and outstanding under the 2007 Stock Plan, respectively.
During the year ended December31, 2015 we awarded a total of 20,000 shares of restricted stock to members of our Board of Directors and senior management. No shares of restricted stock were awarded during the year ended December31, 2014. During the years ended December31, 2015 and 2014, approximately 94 and 8,000 shares of restricted stock vested, respectively. There were forfeitures of approximately 1,000 shares of restricted stock during years ended December31, 2015 and 2014. The fair market value for stock-based compensation expense is equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. The restrictions on the stock award are released generally over four years for senior management and over one year for board members. Stock-based compensation expense includes $8,000, $01 million and $02 million for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively for restricted stock.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $160, $380 and $316 respectively.
As of December31, 2015, there were approximately $08 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options and restricted stock. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 29 years.
The total intrinsic value of stock option exercises for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $03 million, $04 million and $06 million, respectively. The total fair value of stock awards vested during the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $03 million, $03 million and $01 million, respectively.
The deferred income tax benefits from stock options expense related to Evolving Systems U.K. totaled approximately $19,000, $15,000 and $15,000 for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
Cash received from stock option exercises was $02 million, $02 million and $05 million for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
During the year ended December31, 2014, we had net settlement exercises of stock options, whereby the optionee did not pay cash for the options but instead received the number of shares equal to the difference between the exercise price and the market
54 Table of Contents
price on the date of exercise. Net settlement exercises during the year ended December31, 2014, resulted in approximately 7,094 shares issued and 26,376 options cancelled in settlement of shares issued. There were no net settlement exercises during the years ended December31, 2015 or 2013.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, we are authorized to issue up to 550,000 shares of our common stock to full-time employees, nearly all of whom are eligible to participate. Under the terms of the ESPP, employees may elect to have up to 15% of their gross compensation withheld through payroll deduction to purchase our common stock, capped at $25,000 annually and no more than 10,000 shares per offering period. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower of the market price at the beginning or end of each three-month participation period. As of December31, 2015, there were approximately 53,000 shares available for purchase. For the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded compensation expense of $13,000, $17,000 and $2,000, respectively, associated with grants under the ESPP which includes the fair value of the look-back feature of each grant as well as the 15% discount on the purchase price. This expense fluctuates each period primarily based on the level of employee participation.

We issued shares related to the ESPP of approximately 9,000, 9,000 and 1,000 for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
NOTE 9 BENEFIT PLANS
We have established a defined contribution retirement plan for our employees under section 401kof the Internal Revenue Code the 401kPlan that is available to all U.S. employees 21 years of age or older with a month of service. Beginning in 2012, we adopted a Safe Harbor 401krequiring us to contribute 3% of the employees compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of whether the employee chooses to participate in the plan. All employee contributions are fully vested immediately and employer contributions vest over a period of three years. Evolving Systems U.K. has established a defined contribution pension scheme that is available to all employees in their first full month of employment. Employees may contribute a percentage of their earnings, the amount of which is dependent upon the age of the employee, not to exceed the maximum statutory contribution amount. We match 5% of employee contributions. All contributions are immediately vested in their entirety.
During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded a consolidated expense of $04 million, $04 million and $03 million, under the aforementioned plans, respectively.
NOTE 10 EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, plus all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents using the treasury stock method. Common stock equivalents consist of stock options. The following is the reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations in thousands except per share data

We lease office and operating facilities and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Current facility leases include our headquarters in Englewood, Colorado, Durham, North Carolina, London and Bath, England, Bangalore and Kolkata,India, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Bucharest, Romania. Rent expense was $06 million, $06 million and $04 million for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Rent expense is net of sublease rental income. There were was no sublease rental income for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
Our headquarters facility lease extends for the term through November30, 2017. The lease contains a clause that adjusts the lease rate every year. The lease rate increases annually as of December1. Our London, England facility contains a clause which gives us six months free rent over the five year term. We account for the effect of such escalating lease payments as if the lease rate were consistent over the lease term. Future minimum commitments under non-cancelable operating leases and capital leases gross of sublease payments as of December31, 2015 are as follows in thousands

b Other Commitments
As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements with officers and directors under which we agree to indemnify them for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in this capacity. The term of the indemnification period is indefinite. There is no limit on the amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements; however, we maintain Director and Officer insurance policies, as well as an Employment Practices Liability Insurance Policy, that may enable us to recover a portion of any amounts paid. Accordingly, we did not record any liabilities for these agreements as of December31, 2015 and 2014.

We enter into standard indemnification terms with customers and suppliers, as discussed below, in the ordinary course of business. As we may subcontract the development of deliverables under customer contracts, we could be required to indemnify customers for work performed by subcontractors. Depending upon the nature of the customer indemnification, the potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements may be unlimited. We may be able to recover damages from a subcontractor if the indemnification to customers results from the subcontractors failure to perform. To the extent we are unable to recover damages from a subcontractor, we could be required to reimburse the indemnified party for the full amount. We have never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to indemnification arising out of subcontractors failure to perform. We did not record any liabilities for these agreements as of December31, 2015 and 2014.
Our standard license agreements contain product warranties that the software will be free of material defects and will operate in accordance with the stated requirements for a limited period of time. The product warranty provisions require us to cure any defects through any reasonable means. We believe the estimated fair value of the product warranty provisions in the license agreements in place with our customers is minimal. Accordingly, we did not record any liabilities for these product warranty provisions as of December31, 2015 and 2014.
Our software arrangements generally include a product indemnification provision whereby we will indemnify and defend a customer in actions brought against the customer for claims that our products infringe upon a copyright, trade secret, or valid patent. We have not historically incurred any significant costs related to product indemnification claims. Accordingly, we did not record any liabilities for these indemnification provisions as of December31, 2015 and 2014.
In connection with our acquisition of Telespree on October24, 2013, we agreed to make a cash payment of $05 million on the one year anniversary of the closing. This payment was subject to reduction for certain claims and has not been paid to date. We have made claims against this payment which are currently under dispute. Once settled the final payment will be released.
c Litigation
From time to time, we are involved in various legal matters arising in the normal course of business. We do not expect the outcome of such proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
NOTE 12 SEGMENT INFORMATION
We define operating segments as components of our enterprise for which separate financial information is reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision-makers to evaluate performance and to make operating decisions. We have identified our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer decision-makers CODM. These chief operating decision makers review revenue by segment and review overall results of operations.
We currently operate our business as two operating segments based on revenue type: license fees and services revenue and customer support revenue as shown on the consolidated statements of operations. License fees and services LS revenue represents the fees received from the license of software products and those services directly related to the delivery of the licensed products, such as fees for custom development, integration services and SaaS service. Customer support CS revenue includes annual support fees, recurring maintenance fees, fees for maintenance upgrades and warranty services. Warranty services that are similar to software maintenance services are typically bundled with a license sale. Total assets by segment have not been disclosed as the information is not available to the chief operating decision-makers.

NOTE 13 RESTRUCTURING
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we undertook a reduction in workforce involving the termination of employees resulting in an expense of $05 million primarily related to severance for the affected employees.

Restructuring expense of $02 million and $06 million was recorded for the years ending December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, due to severance for a reduction in workforce.

In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, we are required to apply judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Managements report on internal control over financial reporting.
