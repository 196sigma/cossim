NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2013 Note 1Principal Industry JAKKS Pacific, Inc. the Company is engaged in the development, production and marketing of consumer products, including toys and related products, electronic products, pet toys and related products, and other consumer products, many of which are based on highly-recognized character and entertainment licenses. The Company commenced its primary business operations in July 1995 through the purchase of substantially all of the assets of a Hong Kong toy company. The Company markets its product lines domestically and internationally. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in January 1995. Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. In consolidation, all significant inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated. Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less, when acquired, to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposits which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk of cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained at financial institutions and, at times, balances may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has never experienced any losses related to these balances. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Credit is granted to customers on an unsecured basis. Credit limits and payment terms are established based on extensive evaluations made on an ongoing basis throughout the fiscal year of the financial performance, cash generation, financing availability, and liquidity status of each customer. Customers are reviewed at least annually, with more frequent reviews performed as necessary, depending upon the customers financial condition and the level of credit being extended. For customers who are experiencing financial difficulties, management performs additional financial analyses before shipping to those customers on credit. The Company uses a variety of financial arrangements to ensure collectability of accounts receivable of customers deemed to be a credit risk, including requiring letters of credit, purchasing various forms of credit insurance with unrelated third parties, or requiring cash in advance of shipment. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon managements assessment of the business environment, customers financial condition, historical collection experience, accounts receivable aging, customer disputes, and the collectability of specific customer accounts.  46  Use of estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual future results could differ from those estimates. Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized upon the shipment of goods to customers or their agents, depending upon terms, provided there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Generally the Company does not allow product returns.It provides its customers a negotiated allowance for breakage or defects, which is recorded when the related revenue is recognized. However, the Company does make occasional exceptions to this policy and consequently accrues a return allowance based upon historic return amounts and management estimates.The Company occasionally grants credits to facilitate markdowns and sales of slow moving merchandise. These credits are recorded as a reduction of gross sales at the time of the sale. The Companys reserve for sales returns and allowances decreased by $30 million from $344 million as of December 31, 2012 to $314 million as of December 31, 2013. This decrease was primarily due to certain customers taking their year-end allowances related to 2012 and 2013 during 2013.  47  Fair value measurements Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company uses various methods including market, income and cost approaches. Based upon these approaches, the Company often utilizes certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and/or the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market-corroborated, or unobservable inputs. The Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Based upon observable inputs used in the valuation techniques, the Company is required to provide information according to the fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values into three broad levels as follows Level 1 Valuations for assets and liabilities traded in active markets from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Valuations for assets and liabilities traded in less active dealer or broker markets. Valuations are obtained from third-party pricing services for identical or similar assets or liabilities. Level 3 Valuations incorporate certain assumptions and projections in determining the fair value assigned to suchassets or liabilities. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based upon inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The following table summarizes the Companys financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31 in thousands

The Companys accounts receivable, short term debt, accounts payable and accrued expenses represent financial instruments. The carrying value of these financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of fair value. The fair value of the 450% convertible senior notes payable due 2014 as of December 31, 2012, and 2013 was approximately $1079 millionand $377 million, respectively, and the fair value of the 425% convertible senior notes payable due 2018 as of December 31, 2013 was $974 million based upon the most recent quoted market prices. The fair values of the convertible senior notes are considered to be Level 2 measurements on the fair value hierarchy. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, there was no impairment to the value of the Companys non-financial assets.  48  Inventory Inventory, which includes the ex-factory cost of goods, capitalized warehouse costs and in-bound freight and duty, is valued at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or market, net of inventory obsolescence reserve, and consists of the following in thousands 
December 31  2012 2013 Raw materials 3,296 1,784 Finished goods 56,394 45,000  59,690 46,784 Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and are being depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives as follows Office equipment 5 years Automobiles 5 years Furniture and fixtures 5 - 7 years Leasehold improvements Shorter of length of lease or 10 years The Company uses the usage method as its depreciation methodology for molds and tools used in the manufacturing of its products, which is more closely correlated to production of goods.The Company believes that the usage method more accurately matches costs with revenues.Furthermore, the useful estimated life of molds and tools is two years. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012, and 2013, the Companys aggregate depreciation expense related to property and equipment was $139 million, $136 million, and $118 million, respectively. Other Comprehensive Income Loss Other comprehensive income loss includes all changes in equity from non-owner sources. The Company accounts for other comprehensive income in accordance with ASC 220, Comprehensive Income. All the activity in other comprehensive income loss and all amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income loss relate to foreign currency translation adjustments.  49  Advertising Production costs of commercials and programming are charged to operations in the period during which the production is first aired. The costs of other advertising, promotion and marketing programs are charged to operations in the period incurred. Advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, was approximately $155 million, $188 million, and $101 million, respectively. The Company also participates in cooperative advertising arrangements with some customers, whereby it allows a discount from invoiced product amounts in exchange for customer purchased advertising that features the Companys products. Typically, these discounts range from 1% to 6% of gross sales, and are generally based upon product purchases or specific advertising campaigns. Such amounts are accrued when the related revenue is recognized or when the advertising campaign is initiated. These cooperative advertising arrangements are accounted for as direct selling expenses. Income taxes The Company does not file a consolidated return with its foreign subsidiaries. The Company files federal and state returns and its foreign subsidiaries file returns in their respective jurisdictions. Deferred taxes are provided on an asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized as deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. Foreign Currency Translation Exposure The Companys reporting currency is the US dollar. The translation of its net investment in subsidiaries with non-US dollar functional currencies subjects the Company to currency exchange rate fluctuations in its results of operations and financial position. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with non-US dollar functional currencies are translated into US dollars at year-end exchange rates. Income, expense, and cash flow items are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. The resulting currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss/gain within stockholders equity. The Companys primary currency translation exposures in 2011, 2012 and 2013 were related to its net investment in entities having functional currencies denominated in the Hong Kong dollar. Foreign Currency Transaction Exposure Currency exchange rate fluctuations may impact the Companys results of operations and cash flows. The Companys currency transaction exposures include gains and losses realized on unhedged inventory purchases and unhedged receivables and payables balances that are denominated in a currency other than the applicable functional currency. Gains and losses on unhedged inventory purchases and other transactions associated with operating activities are recorded in the components of operating income in the consolidated statement of operations. Inventory purchase transactions denominated in the Hong Kong dollar were the primary transactions that caused foreign currency transaction exposure for the Company in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Accounting for the impairment of finite-lived tangible and intangible assets Long-lived assets with finite lives, which include property and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill, are evaluated at least annually for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of these assets. When any such impairment exists, the related assets will be written down to fair value.Finite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of product technology rights, acquired backlog, customer relationships, product lines and license agreements. These intangible assets are amortized over the estimated economic lives of the related assets. There were no impairments for years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013.  50  Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. Losses in value are recorded when material impairment has occurred in the underlying assets or when the benefits of the identified intangible assets are realized.Indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill consist of trademarks. The carrying value of goodwill and trademarks are based upon cost, which is subject to managements current assessment of fair value. Management evaluates fair value recoverability using both objective and subjective factors. Objective factors include cash flows and analysis of recent sales and earnings trends. Subjective factors include managements best estimates of projected future earningsand competitive analysis and the Companys strategic focus. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, there was no impairment to the value of the Company goodwill or trademarks. Share-based Compensation The Company measures all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and records such expense in its consolidated financial statements.The Company recorded no stock option compensation in each of 2011, 2012, and 2013.The company recorded $16 million, $11 million, and $11 million of restricted stock expense, in 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively.See Note 17 for further details relating to share based compensation.  51  Earnings per share The following table is a reconciliation of the weighted-average shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share EPS for the periods presented in thousands, except per share data

The Company assesses goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis by reviewing relevant qualitative and quantitative factors. More frequent evaluations may be required if the Company experiences changes in its business climate or as a result of other triggering events that take place. If carrying value exceeds fair value, a possible impairment exists and further evaluation is performed. The Company assessed its goodwill for impairment as of October 1, 2013 for each of its reporting units by evaluating qualitative factors, including, but not limited to, the performance of each reporting unit, general economic conditions, access to capital, the industry and competitive environment, the interest rate environment. The Company prepared step-one of its impairment model. The valuation of goodwill involves a high degree of judgment and uncertainty related to key assumptions. Due to the subjective nature of the impairment analysis, significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimate could materially affect the conclusion regarding the future cash flows necessary to support the valuation of goodwill. Based on the Companys assessment, it determined that the fair value of its reporting units were not less than the carrying amounts. As such, the Company determined there was no impairment to be recorded. Please refer to Note 5 for goodwill for prior year acquisitions.  57  Note 7Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill Intangible assets other than goodwill consist primarily of licenses, product lines, customer relationships and trademarks.

In November 2009, the Company sold an aggregate of $1000 million principal amount of the 2014 Notes. The 2014 Notes, which are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, pay cash interest semi-annually at a rate of 450% per annum and will mature on November 1, 2014. The initial conversion rate was 632091 shares of JAKKS common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $1582 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. As a result of the cash dividend of $010 per share declared by the Board of Directors paid October 3, 2011, January 3, 2012, April 2, 2012, July 2, 2012, October 1, 2012 and January 2, 2013 and of $007 per share declared by the Board paid April 1, 2013 and July 1, 2013 and the above-market self-tender offer in July 2012 see Note 15 Common Stock, Preferred Stock and Warrants, the new conversion rateis 688564 shares of JAKKS common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes or approximately $1452 per share.

In accordance with ASC 470-20, the Company allocated $137 million of the $1000 million principal amount of the 2014 Notes to the equity component, which represents a discount to the debt that is being amortized to interest expense through November 1, 2014.

The Company repurchased $610 million of the 2014 Notes during the year ended December 31, 2013 as discussed below, with $28 million of the price allocated to the repurchase of the related equity component. In addition, approximately $22 million of the unamortized debt discount and $06 million ofdebt issuance costs were written off in connection with the repurchase of the 2014 Notes. The balance of the discount was $51 million and $09 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013, respectively. On July 24, 2013, the Company sold an aggregate of $1000 million principal amount of the 2018 Notes.The 2018 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company paying interest semi-annually in arrears on August 1 and February 1 of each year at a rate of 425% per annum and will mature on August 1, 2018.The initial conversion rate for the 2018 Notes will be 1143674 shares of the Companys common per $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $874 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment in certain events.Holders of the 2018 Notes may convert their notes upon the occurrence of specified events.Upon conversion, the 2018 Notes will be settled in shares of the Companys common stock.The Company used $610 million of the approximate $960 million in net proceeds from the offering to repurchase at par $610 million principal amount of the 2014 Notes. The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The fair value of the 2014 Notes as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013 was approximately $1079 million and $377 million, respectively, based upon the most recent quoted market price. The fair value of the 2018 Notes as of December 31, 2013 was approximately $974 million, based upon the most recent quoted market price.

62  Note 13Income Taxes The Company does not file a consolidated return with its foreign subsidiaries. The Company files federal and state returns and its foreign subsidiaries file returns in their respective jurisdictions. The Companys income tax expense, which includes federal, state and foreign income taxes, was $26 million, or an effective tax rate of 51% for the year ended 2013. For the years ended 2011 and 2012, the provision for income taxes, which included Federal, state and foreign income taxes, was a benefit of $90 million and an expense of $862 million, reflecting effective tax provision rates of 1,671% and 462%, respectively. The2013 tax expense of $26 millionincluded adiscretetax benefit of $03 million comprised of uncertain tax positions and return to provision true-ups.Absent these discrete tax expenses, the effective tax rate for 2013 was 58%, primarily dueto a full valuation allowance on the Company United States deferred tax assets and the foreign rate differential is impacted by the proportion of Hong Kong earnings to overall earnings and is expected to vary depending on the level of consolidated earnings. For the years ended 2011 and 2012, provision for income taxes includes federal, state and foreign income taxes at effective tax rates of 1,671% and 462%, respectively.Exclusive of discrete items, the effective tax provision rate would be 1,288% in 2011 and 342% in 2012. The decrease in the effective rate absent discrete items was primarily due to the foreign rate differential between the United States and Hong Kong. The rate exclusive of discrete items can be materially impacted by the proportion of Hong Kong earnings to consolidated earnings. For the years ended 2012 and 2013, benefit for income taxes includes federal, state and foreign income taxes at effective tax rates of 462% and 51%, respectively. The Company recorded a tax expense of $917 million in 2012 to set up the valuation allowance against it United States deferred tax assets. This attributed to a significantly higher tax expense in 2012 compared to 2013. Exclusive of these discrete items, the effective tax provision rate would be 342% in 2012 and 58% in 2013.The decrease in the effective tax benefit rate in 2013 absent discrete items was primarily due to a decrease HKs earnings relative to the Companys consolidated losses compared to 2012 as well as its valuation allowance position in the United States. For year ended 2013, the Company had net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $30 million related to foreign jurisdictions.  63  Benefit provision for income taxes reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations are comprised of the following in thousands

51 Deferred taxes result from temporary differences between tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. The temporary differences result from costs required to be capitalized for tax purposes by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code IRC, and certain items accrued for financial reporting purposes in the year incurred but not deductible for tax purposes until paid. The Company has established a full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets in the United States since, in the opinion of management, it is not more likely than not that the U.S. net deferred tax assets will be realized.

The Company has approximately $220 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiariesfor which U.S. taxes have not been provided on December 31, 2013. These earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. If future events necessitate that these earnings should be repatriated to the U.S., an additional tax expense and related liability may be required. The Company uses a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the consolidated financial statements uncertain tax positions UTP taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Approximately $03 million of new unrecognized tax positions UTPs were recognized in 2013. These UTPs are associated with a reserve for U.S. federal and state research and development credits. In addition, approximately $25 million of Hong Kong based UTPs became de-recognized during 2013, primarily due to settlement of tax audits. These items were included in the 2013 income tax provision, except for the UTP related to carryforward credits. During 2012, approximately $06 million of the liability for UTP was recognized, and approximately $08 million of the liability for UTP was de-recognized. Current interest on uncertain income tax liabilities is recognized as interest expense and penalties are recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. During 2011, the Company recognized $02 million of current year interest expense relating to UTPs. During 2012, the Company recognized $27,000 of current year interest expense relating to UTPs.During 2013, the Company recognized $120,000 of current year interest expense relating to UTPs.  65  The following table provides further information of UTPs that would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized, as of December 31, 2013 in millions Balance, January 1, 2011

Tax years 2010 through 2012remain subject to examination in the United States and tax years 2009 through 2012 are still subject to examination in California.The tax years 2007 through 2012 are still subject to examination in Hong Kong. In the normal course of business, the Company is audited by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities.The U.S. Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the Companys 2008 related to a refund claim, 2010, and 2011 U.S. federal income tax returns. The Company was under examination by various state jurisdictions during 2013.The ultimate resolution of the state examinations, including matters that may be resolved within the next twelve months, is not yet determinable. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets by jurisdiction. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2013. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as the Companys projections for future growth. The Company is required to establish a valuation allowance for the U.S. deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if Management determines, based upon available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized. For the three-year period ended December 31, 2013, the Company was in a cumulative pre-tax loss position in the U.S. On the basis of this evaluation, as of December 31, 2013, a valuation allowance of $1083 million has been recorded against the U.S. deferred tax assets that more likely than not will not be realized. The net deferred tax liabilities of $30 million represent the net deferred tax liabilities in the foreign jurisdiction, where the Company is in a cumulative income position. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as the Companys projections for growth. At December 31, 2013, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $240 million, which will begin to expire in 2031. At December 31, 2013, the Company state NOLs were mainly from California. The majority of the approximately $890 million of California NOLs will begin to expire in 2031. At December 31, 2013, the Company had foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $150 million, which will begin to expire in 2022. At December 31, 2013, the Company had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards credit carryforwards of approximately $05 million, which will begin to expire in 2029. At December 31, 2013, the Company had state research and development tax credits of approximately $160,000, which carry forward indefinitely. Utilization of certain NOLs and research credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations set forth in Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and comparable state income tax laws. Any future annual limitation may result in the expiration of NOLs and credit carryforwards before utilization.  66  Note 14Leases The Company leases office, warehouse and showroom facilities and certain equipment under operating leases. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 totaled $145 million, $133 million, and $144 million, respectively.

71  Stock Options Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee requisite service period.During the fiscal period ending December 31, 2013, the Company incurred no expense related to stock options previously awarded. The Company uses the Black-Scholes method of valuation for share-based option awards. In valuing the stock options, the Black-Scholes model incorporates assumptions about stock volatility, expected term of stock options, and risk free interest rate. The valuation is reduced by an estimate of stock option forfeitures. As of December 31, 2013, 1,225,058 shares were available for future grant. Additional shares may become available to the extent that options or shares of restricted stock presently outstanding under the Plan terminate or expire. Stock option activity pursuant to the Plan is summarized as follows

The Company measures the fair value of the warrants granted on the measurement date. The fair value of the 2012 stock warrant is capitalized as an intangible asset and will be amortized to expense in the consolidated statements of operations when the related product is released and the related net sales are recognized, which commenced in the third quarter of 2013.

In the fourth quarter of 2012 and the second quarter of 2013, the Company experienced poor performance of some of the Companys products which coupled with advertising commitments, license royalty shortfalls and retailer markdowns due to lower than anticipated sales and sell-through, resulted in significant net losses. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company recognized a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets, resulting in a non-cash charge to income of $917 million. Quarterly and year-to-date computations of income loss per share amounts are made independently. Therefore, the sum of the per share amounts for the quarters may not agree with the per share amounts for the year.  74  Note 21 Litigation In or about the end of July 2013, two purported class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California: 1 Melot v. JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. et al, Case No. CV13-05388 JAK filed on July 25, 2013; and 2 Dylewicz v. JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. et al, Case No.CV13-5487 OON filed on July 30, 2013 collectively, the Class Action.The complaints in the Class Action alleged that the Company made false and/or misleading statements concerning the extent of the negative impact that the shift in childrens preference for electronic devices was having on sales of the Companys more traditional toys, and the extent of the negative impact from poor sales of various of the Companys licensed products,and/or that the Companys financial statements were materially false and misleading.These allegations make reference to matters contained in the July 17, 2013 Press Release.The Class Period in the Class Action is from July 17, 2012 July 17, 2013.The Class Action sought compensatory and other damages in an undisclosed amount, and alleged violations of Section 10b of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by each of the defendants namely the Company and Messrs. Berman and Bennett, and violations of Section 20a of the Exchange Act by Messrs. Berman and Bennett.The Court appointed a lead plaintiff and selected Class Counsel.An amended complaint the FAC was filed which alleged the same Class Period and causes of action and the Company has filed a motion to dismiss the FAC.Briefing is in progress with respect to that motion.The Company believes that the claims in the Class Action are without merit and intend to defend vigorously against them.However, because the Class Action is in a preliminary stage, the Company cannot be assured as to its outcome, or that an adverse decision in such action would not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. On February25, 2014, a shareholder derivative action was filed in the Central District of California by Advisors, G.P. against the Company, nominally, and against Messrs. Berman, Bennett, Miller, Skala, Glick, Ellin, Almagor, Poulsen and Reilly and Ms. Brodsky Advanced Partners, G.P.,v. Berman, et al., CV14-1420 DSF the Derivative Action.The Derivative Action seeks to hold the individual defendants liable for damages allegedly caused to the Company by their actions and, in particular, to hold Messrs. Berman and Bennett liable on contribution and breach of fiduciary duty theories with respect to any liability the Company incurs in connection with the Class Action; to holdthe individual defendants other than Bennett the Director Defendants then serving as directors liable for alleged violation of Rule14a-9 in connection with the October25, 2013 Proxy Statement statements with respect to Bermans compensation; and to hold certain of the Director Defendants liable for alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties in connection with the Companys repurchase of stock, transactions with Dr. Patrick Soon, and Bermans compensation.On March 6, 2014 a shareholder derivative action was filed in the Central District of California by Louisiana municipal Police Employees Retirement System against the Company, nominally, and against the same defendants as in the First Derivative Action Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System v, Berman et al , CV14-1670 GHF the Second Derivative Action. The Second Derivative Action makes substantially the same claims as set forth above in connection with the First Derivative Action. The Company is a party to, and certain of its property is the subject of, various other pending claims and legal proceedings that routinely arise in the ordinary course of its business. The Company does not believe that any of these claims or proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.  75  JAKKS PACIFIC, INC.
