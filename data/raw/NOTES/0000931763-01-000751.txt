ITEM 8.      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
Report of Independent Public Accountants
To U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of U.S. Xpress
Enterprises, Inc. a Nevada corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States. s/ ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP Chattanooga, Tennessee

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts
1.  Organization and Operations
U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc. the Company provides transportation services
through two business segments. U.S. Xpress, Inc. U.S. Xpress is a truckload
carrier serving the continental United States and parts of Canada and Mexico.
CSI/Crown, Inc. CSI/Crown provides transportation services primarily to the
floorcovering industry. The Company also owns 13% of Transplace.com, LLC
Transplace, an Internet-based global transportation logistics company. 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have
been eliminated.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investment instruments with
an original maturity of three months or less.
Recognition of Revenue
For financial reporting purposes, the Company generally recognizes revenue and
direct costs when shipments are completed.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to customer receivables are limited
due to the large number of entities comprising the Company customer base and
their dispersion across many different industries. The Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations and generally does not require collateral.
Operating and Installation Supplies
Operating supplies consist primarily of tires, parts, materials and supplies for
servicing the Company revenue and service equipment. Installation supplies
consist of various accessories used in the installation of floorcoverings and
are held for sale at various CSI/Crown distribution centers. Operating and
installation supplies are recorded at the lower of cost on a first-in, first-
out basis or market. Tires and tubes purchased as part of revenue and service
equipment are capitalized as part of the cost of the equipment. Replacement
tires and tubes are charged to expense when placed in service.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation of property and
equipment is computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting
purposes and accelerated methods for tax purposes over the estimated useful
lives of the related assets net of salvage value. The cost and lives are as
follows                    24                           Cost
Lives    2000   1999
Land and buildings        10-30 years $ 24,952 $ 16,677
Revenue and service equipment   3-7 years  249,773  223,991
Furniture and equipment      3-7 years   21,299  19,169
Leasehold improvements      5-6 years   19,456  16,043
$315,480 $275,880
The Company recognized $30,593, $27,101 and $24,097 in depreciation expense in
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Gains losses on sales of equipment of
$281, $764 and $237 for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, are included in
depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. During 2000, the Company capitalized $483 of interest.
Upon the retirement of property and equipment, the related asset cost and
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is
reflected in the Company statement of operations with the exception of gains
on trade-ins, which are included in the basis of the new asset. Expenditures for
normal maintenance and repairs are expensed. Renewals or betterments that
affect the nature of an asset or increase its useful life are capitalized.
Goodwill
The excess of the consideration paid by the Company over the estimated fair
value of identifiable net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill and is
being amortized on the straight-line basis over periods ranging from 20 to 40
years. The Company continually evaluates whether subsequent events and
circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of
goodwill might warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be
recoverable. When factors indicate that goodwill should be evaluated for
possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the future undiscounted net
cash flows of the related businesses over the remaining life of the goodwill in
measuring whether goodwill is recoverable. The Company recognized $1,999, $1,977
and $1,244 of goodwill amortization expense in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. Accumulated amortization was $6,416, and $4,572 at December 31,
2000 and 1999, respectively.
Computer Software
The Company accounts for computer software in accordance with the AICPA
Statement of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. Computer software is included
in other long-term assets and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over
three years. The Company recognized $1,732, $761 and $430 of amortization
expense in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Accumulated amortization was
$3,461 and $2,072 at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Book Overdraft
Book overdraft represents outstanding checks in excess of current cash levels.
The Company will fund the book overdraft from its line of credit and operating
cash flows.
Investment in Transplace
On July 1, 2000, the Company and five other large transportation companies
merged their logistics business units into a commonly owned, Internet-based
global transportation logistics company, Transplace. As Transplace is a limited
liability corporation, the Company accounts for its 13% ownership in Transplace
under the equity method of accounting. The Company equity in the earnings of
Transplace for 2000 was immaterial.
Claims and Insurance Accruals
Claims and insurance accruals consist of cargo loss, damage, liability personal
injury and property damage and workers' compensation in excess of established
deductible levels and group health claims. Claims in excess of deductible levels
are covered by insurance in amounts the Company considers adequate. Current
deductible levels range from $3 for liability to $350 for group health claims.
Claims accruals represent the uninsured portion of pending claims at December
31, 2000 and 1999, plus an estimated liability for incurred but not reported
claims. Accruals for cargo loss, damage, liability and workers' compensation
claims are estimated based on the Company evaluation of the type and severity
of individual claims. Accruals for group health insurance claims are based on
the Company estimate of outstanding claims determined by the Company past
claims experience.
25 Other Long-Term Liabilities
Periodically, the Company receives volume rebates from vendors related to
certain operating leases for new revenue and service equipment. Additionally,
certain equipment leases include spare tires, which increase tire inventories.
The Company defers recognition of these rebates and amortizes such amounts as a
reduction of vehicle rent expense over the respective lease terms. At December
31, 2000 and 1999, other long-term liabilities include deferred credits of
$2,231 and $2,814, respectively.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company has only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments
and does not use them for trading purposes. Interest rate swap agreements, which
are used by the Company to manage its interest rate exposure, are accounted for
on the accrual basis. Amounts to be paid or received under interest rate swap
agreements are recorded in interest expense in the period in which they accrue.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income is the total of net income and all other non-owner changes
in stockholders' equity. For all periods presented, comprehensive income is the
same as net income in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
Earnings Per Share
The difference between basic and diluted earnings per share is due to the
assumed conversion of dilutive outstanding options resulting in approximately
53,000, 67,000 and 124,000 equivalent shares in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans under Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
APB No. 25. Effective fiscal 1997, the Company adopted the disclosure
option of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities the
Statement. The Statement establishes accounting and reporting standards
requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as
either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. The Statement requires
that changes in the derivative fair value be recognized currently in earnings,
unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Special accounting for
qualifying hedges allows a derivative gains and losses to offset related
results on the hedged item in the income statement, and requires that a company
must formally document, designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions
that receive hedge accounting.
As amended by SFAS No. 137, SFAS 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2000. The Company adopted SFAS 133 effective January 1, 2001.
The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company financial
statements. However, it could increase the volatility in earnings and other
comprehensive income for future periods.

During 1998, the Company entered into a line of credit with a syndicate of banks
with aggregate capacity up to $225,000. In January 2001, the line of credit
agreement was amended. Under the terms of the amended agreement, the facility
will be reduced to $215,000 on June 30, 2001. Borrowings including letters of
credit under the line are limited to a specified percentage of eligible
accounts receivable and the net book value of revenue equipment. Letters of
credit are limited to an aggregate of $10,000 under the line. The credit
agreement is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the Company.
Letters of credit outstanding against the line of credit were $8,677, and
$48,323 was available under the facility at December 31, 2000.
Borrowings under the line of credit bear interest, at the option of the Company,
equal to either: i the greater of the bank prime rate or the federal funds
rate plus 50%, ii the rate offered in the Eurodollar market for amounts and
periods comparable to the relevant loan plus a margin that is determined by a
financial covenant, or iii the rate offered to the Company for a loan of a
specific amount and maturity by any of the participating banks under a
competitive bid process. At December 31, 2000, the margin applicable to the
Eurodollar interest rate was equal to 175%.
Borrowings under the mortgage note payable bear interest based on the 30-day
commercial paper rate, plus a margin. This rate can be converted to a fixed
rate at any time up to September 2002.
The line of credit agreement subjects the Company to certain restrictions and
financial covenants related to, among other matters, dividends, net worth,
additional borrowings, acquisitions and dispositions, and maintenance of certain
financial ratios.

28 7.  Derivative Financial Instruments
Interest rate swap agreements are used to manage well-defined interest rate
risks. Under interest rate swap agreements, the Company agrees with other
parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate
and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon
notional amount. Under these agreements, the Company receives interest payments
at rates equal to LIBOR reset quarterly, and pays interest at fixed rates shown
below    Notional  Fixed Rate  Variable Rate    Effective     Expiration
Amounts  Component   Component      Date        Date
$10,000    5730%    6751%   February 6, 1998  February 6, 2003
15,000    5705     6751    February 6, 1998  February 6, 2003
10,000    5145     6751    August 6, 1999   February 6, 2003
10,000    5565     6618    September 8, 1998 September 8, 2003 The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by the
counterparties to its interest rate swap agreements. The Company anticipates,
however, that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations
under the contracts. The Company does not obtain collateral or other security
to support financial instruments subject to credit risk, but monitors the
credit-standing of counterparties.
The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is defined as the amount the
Company would receive or would be required to pay to terminate further
obligations under the agreements. At December 31, 2000, the Company estimates
the amount it would receive to terminate the agreements approximates $159. 8.  Leases
The Company leases certain revenue and service equipment and office and terminal
facilities under long-term non-cancelable operating lease agreements expiring at
various dates through December 2005. Rental expense under non-cancelable
operating leases was approximately $65,950, $60,335 and $37,213 for 2000, 1999
and 1998, respectively.
The Company is party to a long-term lease of a corporate office and operations
facility, which is scheduled to expire in January 2003. Payments under the
lease are based on LIBOR rates applied to the cost of the facility funded by the
lessor. The Company has an option to renew the lease for up to three three-year
extensions, subject to certain conditions. If the Company does not purchase the
property at the end of the lease term, whether caused by expiration, default or
otherwise, the Company would guarantee a residual value to the lessor of up to
the lessor net investment in the property. Under the lease, the Company is
required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants.
Approximate aggregate minimum future rentals payable under these operating
leases for each of the next five years are                 2001  $63,428
2002   35,440
2003   17,985
2004   8,753
2005   3,308
9.  Related Party Transactions
The Company leases certain office and terminal facilities from entities owned by
the two principal stockholders of the Company. The lease agreements are for
five-year terms and provide the Company with the option to renew the lease
agreements for four three-year terms. Rent expense of approximately $851, $868
and $1,480 was recognized in connection with these leases during 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively.
29 The two principal stockholders of the Company and certain partnerships
controlled by their families own 100% of the outstanding common stock of Paragon
Leasing LLC Paragon. Paragon leases certain revenue and service equipment to
the Company on a temporary basis. Rent expense of approximately $473, $590 and
$1,162 was recognized in connection with these leases during 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively.
The two principal stockholders of the Company and certain partnerships
controlled by their families own 45% of the outstanding common stock of
Transcommunications, Inc. Transcom.  Beginning in 1999, the Company began
utilizing Transcom charge cards for over-the-road fuel purchases. The Company
paid Transcom $212 and $204 in fees for these services in 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Transcom also makes a debit card system available to the
Company drivers through which phone calls and Internet e-mail can be credited
while the driver is on the road. Total payments by the Company to Transcom for
these services were approximately $511, $441 and $209 in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
On July 1, 2000, the Company and five other large transportation companies
contributed their non-asset based logistics business units into a commonly
owned, Internet-based transportation logistics company, Transplace. During the
last six months of 2000 the Company earned revenues of approximately $126
million from Transplace for providing transportation services.
10. Commitments and Contingencies
In November 2000, the Company signed an agreement with SouthTrust to purchase
certain assets of DTSI, a customer of the Company, at foreclosure by SouthTrust
as secured creditor of DTSI. After the agreement was signed, SouthTrust advised
the Company that it had received a higher offer for the assets from another
party, and that it would cancel the agreement with the Company, unless the
Company matched the higher offer, and SouthTrust sold the assets of DTSI to the
other party.
In December 2000, SouthTrust filed a lawsuit against the Company concerning
events which occurred after SouthTrust terminated the agreement with the
Company. In its lawsuit, SouthTrust claims the Company acted wrongfully and
attempted to interfere with SouthTrust sale of DTSI assets. The lawsuit
seeks damages in an unspecified amount from the Company and seeks to have the
court declare that actions taken by SouthTrust in connection with the sale of
assets were lawful and did not violate any legal rights of the Company. The
Company believes that the SouthTrust lawsuit is without merit and intends to
vigorously defend itself.
The Company is party to certain other legal proceedings incidental to its
business. The ultimate disposition of these matters, in the opinion of
management, based in part on the advice of legal counsel, is not expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Company financial position or results of
operations.
Letters of credit of $8,677 were outstanding at December 31, 2000. The letters
of credit are maintained primarily to support the Company insurance program
see Note 2. The Company pays commitment fees of 175% on the outstanding
portion of the letters of credit. 11. Employee Benefit Plan
The Company has a 401k retirement plan covering substantially all employees of
the Company, whereby participants may contribute a percentage of their
compensation, as allowed under applicable laws. The plan provides for a
matching contribution by the Company. Participants are 100% vested in
participant contributions and become vested in employer matching contributions
over a period of six years. The Company recognized $1,127, $1,425 and $1,263 in
expense under this employee benefit plan for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. 12. Stockholders' Equity
Common Stock
Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share. Holders of
Class B Common Stock are entitled to two votes per share. Once the Class B
Common Stock is no longer held by the two principal stockholders of the Company
or their families as defined, the stock is automatically converted into Class A
Common Stock on a share per share basis.

Under a 1993 sale of restricted stock to certain stockholder employees, notes
receivable from stockholders were issued. The notes bear interest at 6% and are
due to the Company upon demand.
On July 1, 2000, 60,000 restricted shares of Class A Common Stock were issued to
certain executive officers. The restrictions on these 60,000 shares expire over
a five-year period beginning July 3, 2001. Restrictions on these shares expire

options issued under the Directors Stock Plan is set at the fair market value of
the Company stock on the date granted. Options vest ratably on each of the
first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant.
If a board member elects to receive board-related compensation in the form of
stock, the number of shares issued to each director in lieu of cash is
determined based on the amount of earned compensation divided by the fair market
value of the Company stock on the date compensation is earned.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In August 1997, the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP
through which employees meeting certain eligibility criteria may purchase shares
of the Company common stock at a discount. Under the ESPP, eligible employees
may purchase shares of the Company common stock, subject to certain
limitations, at a 15% discount. Common stock is purchased for employees in
January and July of each year. Employees may not purchase more than 1,250

For SFAS No. 123 purposes, the fair value of each option grant and each stock
purchase right under the ESPP has been estimated as of the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions
for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively: risk-free interest rate of 644%, 526%
and 452%, expected life of five years, expected dividend yield of 0% and
expected volatility of 60%, 60% and 61%. Using these assumptions, the fair
value of the awards granted in 2000, 1999 and 1998 is $776, $473 and $756,
respectively, which would be amortized as compensation expense over the vesting
period. Had compensation cost for the plan been determined in accordance with
SFAS No. 123, utilizing the assumptions detailed above, the Company pro forma
net income would have been $1,592, $11,083 and $20,500 for 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. Pro forma basic earnings per share would have been $011, $075
and $136 for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Pro forma diluted earnings per
share would have been $011, $075 and $135 for the same periods.
The pro forma effect on net income in this pro forma disclosure may not be
representative of the pro forma effect on net income in future years, because it
does not take into consideration pro forma compensation expense related to
grants made prior to March 31, 1996.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2000, 1999 and 1998
was $410, $742 and $645, respectively. Of the options outstanding at
December 31, 2000, 494,476 have exercise prices between $472 and $806, with a
weighted average exercise price of $673 and a weighted average remaining
contractual life of 79 years. Of these options, 132,576 are exercisable at a
weighted average exercise price of $559. Options to exercise 90,850 shares
have exercise prices between $950 and $1225, with a weighted average exercise
price of $1193 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 78 years.
Of these options, 41,855 are exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of
$1205. Options to exercise the remaining 121,100 shares have exercise prices

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, customer and other
receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reasonable estimates
of their fair values because of the short maturity of these financial
instruments. Based on the borrowing rates available to the Company for long-
term debt with similar terms and average maturities, the carrying amounts
approximate the fair value of such financial instruments.
32 14. Operating Segments
The Company has two reportable segments based on the types of services it
provides to its customers: U.S. Xpress, which provides truckload operations
throughout the continental United States and parts of Canada and Mexico, and
CSI/Crown, which provides transportation services to the floorcovering industry.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies. All intersegment sales prices are
market based. The Company evaluates performance based on operating income of
the respective business units.
