The Board of Directors
Taitron Components Incorporated We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Taitron
Components Incorporated as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Taitron Components
Incorporated as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the consolidated results of
its operations and its consolidated cash flows for each of the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. s/ Grant Thornton Los Angeles, California

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Taitron Components Incorporated Taitron or the Company is a discrete
components superstore, which distributes a wide variety of transistors,
diodes and other discrete semiconductors, optoelectronic devices and
passive components to other electronic distributors, contract electronic
manufacturers CEMs and original equipment manufacturers OEMs, who
incorporate these devices into their products. In order to meet the rapid
delivery requirements of its customers, the Company maintains a significant
inventory of discrete components.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its majority-owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Concentration of Risk
A significant number of the products distributed by the Company are
manufactured in Taiwan, China, South Korea and the Philippines. The
purchase of goods manufactured in foreign countries is subject to a number
of risks, including economic disruptions, transportation delays and
interruptions, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, imposition of tariffs
and import and export controls and changes in governmental policies, any of
which could have a material adverse effect on the Company business and
results of operations.
The ability to remain competitive with respect to the pricing of imported
components could be adversely affected by increases in tariffs or duties,
changes in trade treaties, strikes in air or sea transportation, and
possible future United States legislation with respect to pricing and
import quotas on products from foreign countries. For example, it is
possible that political or economic developments in China, or with respect
to the United States relationship with China, could have an adverse effect
on the Company business. The Company ability to remain competitive
could also be affected by other government actions related to, among other
things, anti-dumping legislation and international currency fluctuations.
While the Company does not believe that any of these factors adversely
impact its business at present, there can be no assurance that these
factors will not materially adversely affect the Company in the future. Any
significant disruption in the delivery of merchandise from the Company
suppliers, substantially all of whom are foreign, could also have a
material adverse impact on the Company business and results of
operations. Management estimates that over 50% of the Company products
are produced in Asia.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Management of the
Company maintains a relatively low cash balance as cash is used to buy
inventory and to repay debt in order to reduce interest cost.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the merchandise. Reserves for sales
allowances and customer returns are established based upon historical
experience and management estimates as shipments are
26   made. Sales returns for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998
aggregated $631,000, $715,000 and $1,128,000, respectively.
Allowance for Sales Returns and Doubtful Accounts
The allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts was $120,000 at
December 31, 2000 and 1999.
Inventory
Inventory, consisting principally of products held for resale, is stated at
the lower of cost or market, using the first-in, first-out method. The
amount presented in the accompanying financial statements is net of
valuation allowances of $1,326,000 and $1,054,000 at December 31, 2000 and
1999, respectively. The Company uses a systematic methodology that includes
regular evaluations of inventory to identify obsolete, slow-moving and non-
saleable inventory
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed
principally using the accelerated and the straight-line methods using lives
from 5 to 7 years for furniture, machinery and equipment and 315 years for
building and building improvements.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of
Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of
assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying
amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the
assets exceed the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are
reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to
sell.
Stock Option Plan
On January 1, 1996, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
which permits entities to recognize as expense over the vesting period the
fair value of all stock-based awards on the date of grant. Alternatively,
SFAS No. 123 allows entities to continue to apply the provisions of APB
Opinion No. 25, under which, compensation expense would be recorded on the
date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock
exceeded the exercise price, and provides pro forma net income and pro
forma earnings per share disclosures for employee stock options as if the
fair-value-based method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied. The
Company has elected to continue to apply the provisions of APB Opinion No.
25 and provide the pro forma disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which such
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Financial Instruments
The estimated fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their
carrying value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. The
fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying value as the
interest rates are
27   comparable to rates currently offered to the Company for similar debt
instruments with similar maturities. All financial instruments are held for
purposes other than trading.
Net Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to
common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to
issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or
resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings
of the Company.
Foreign Currency Translation
The financial statements of the Company majority owned subsidiary in
Mexico and division in Taiwan, which were established in 1998 and 1997,
respectively, are translated into United States dollars. Balance sheet
accounts are translated at year-end or historical rates while income and
expenses are translated at weighted-average exchange rates for the year.
Translation gains or losses related to net assets are shown as a separate
component of shareholders' equity as comprehensive income. Gains and losses
resulting from realized foreign currency transactions transactions
denominated in a currency other than the entities' functional currency are
included in operations. Such transactional gains and losses are not
significant to the financial statements for 2000, 1999 and 1998.
Segment Reporting
The Company is centrally managed and operates in one business segment:
distribution of discrete semiconductors.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the 1999 and 1998 financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the 2000 financial statement presentation.
Use of Estimates
The Company management has made a number of estimates and assumptions
relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These estimates
have a significant impact on the Company valuation and reserve accounts
relating to the Company allowance for sales returns, doubtful accounts
and inventory reserves. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

deductible differences.
7 401k Profit Sharing Plan
In January 1995, the Company implemented a defined contribution profit
sharing plan pursuant to Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code the
Code covering all employees of the Company. Participants once eligible, as
defined by the plan, may contribute up to 15% of their compensation, but
not in excess of the maximum allowed under the Code. The plan provides for
a matching contribution at the discretion of the Company which vests
immediately, as defined by the plan. For the years ended December 31, 2000,
1999 and 1998 employer matching contributions aggregated approximately
$36,000, $24,000 and $32,000, respectively. The plan sold 39,929 shares of
the Company common stock on the open market for cash consideration of
approximately $117,000 during the year ended December 31, 2000. The plan
purchased 9,780 and 17,942 shares of the Company common stock on the open

8 Stock Options and Warrants
In March 1995, the Company established the 1995 Stock Incentive Plan the
Plan expiring in March, 2005. The Plan provides for the issuance of an
aggregate of 740,000 incentive stock options, nonstatutory options or stock
appreciation rights SAR to directors, officers and other employees of
the Company. Under the Plan, incentive stock options may be granted at
prices equal to at least the fair market value of the Company Class A
common stock at the date of grant. Nonstatutory options and stock
appreciation rights may be granted at prices equal to at least 85% and
100%, respectively, of the fair market value of the Company Class A
common stock at the date of grant. Outstanding options and rights vest
ratably over three years commencing one year from the date of grant and are
subject to termination provisions as defined in the Plan. The Plan also
provides for automatic grants of nonstatutory options to purchase 5,000
shares of Class A common stock to all members of the committee
administering the Plan, upon their initial election to such committee and
each year thereafter. The exercise price of these options will be equal to
the fair market value of the Company Class A common stock at the date of
grant.
In November 1996, the Company gave each employee who held options and SAR
issued during 1995 and 1996 with exercise prices of $525 and $7125 the
right to receive, in place of such options, an
31   amended option for half the shares covered by the original option but with
a reduced exercise price of $225 the market price on November 21, 1996.
In connection with the Company initial public offering, the Company
issued warrants exercisable over a period of four years commencing April
19, 1996 to purchase 220,000 shares of the Company Class A common stock
at a price of $630, which is 120% of the initial public offering price.
These warrants expired unexercised on April 19, 2000.
In April 1995, the Company granted 6,600 stock appreciation rights to
certain employees at an exercise price of $525. Compensation expense
related to these rights was $0 in 2000, 1999 and 1998.
The fair value of options, SAR and warrants used to compute pro forma net
earnings and earnings per share disclosures is the estimated present value
at grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
following weighted average assumptions used for 2000: dividend yield of 0   expected volatility of 70%; a risk free interest rate of approximately 5%
and an expected holding period of five years; assumptions for 1999:
dividend yield of 0%; expected volatility of 72%; a risk free interest rate
of approximately 7% and an expected holding period of five years;
assumptions for 1998 and 1997: dividend yield of 2%; expected volatility of
40%; a risk free interest rate of approximately 6% and an expected holding
period of five years. The incremental fair value of the modified options
substituted for options issued during 1995, used to compute pro forma net
earnings and earnings per share disclosures was determined using the Black-
Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions: dividend yield of 2%; expected volatility of 40%; a risk free
interest rate of approximately 6%; and an expected holding period of 35
years, adjusted to reflect the remaining period to maturity of the modified
options.
The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, but applies Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting
for its Plan SAR and warrants. If the Company had elected to recognize
compensation cost based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards
under the Plan SAR and warrants including the modified awards,
consistent with the method prescribed by SFAS No. 123, net earnings and
earnings per share would have been changed to the pro forma amounts
indicated below                          Year Ended December 31,
