38 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   The Board of Directors and Stockholders   Packeteer, Inc.   We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting appearing under Item9Ab, that
Packeteer, Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2006, because of the
effect of material weaknesses identified in managements
assessment, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. Management of Packeteer, Inc. is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of
control deficiencies, that results in a more than remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The
following material weaknesses have been identified and included
in managements assessment as of December31, 2006:
ithe Company did not maintain effective controls to
provide for the reconciliation of the income taxes payable
account to supporting detail and the review of the income taxes
payable account reconciliation by someone other than the
preparer; and iithe Company did not maintain effective
controls over the review of the rebate reserves as the review
was not appropriately designed, nor was the review conducted in
sufficient detail.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of Packeteer, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December31, 2006 and 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity
and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December31, 2006. The
aforementioned material weaknesses were considered in
determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied
in our audit of the 2006 consolidated financial statements, and
this report does not affect our report dated March15,
2007, which expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements.   
39 Table of Contents   In our opinion, managements assessment that Packeteer,
Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. Also, in our opinion, because of the effect of the
material weaknesses described above on the achievement of the
objectives of the control criteria, Packeteer, Inc. has not
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO.   /s/KPMG

40 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   The Board of Directors and Stockholders   Packeteer, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Packeteer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2006
and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity and comprehensive income and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2006. These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Packeteer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2006, in conformity
with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles.   As discussed in Note1 to the consolidated financial
statements, effective January1, 2006, Packeteer, Inc.
adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payment.
Also, as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements, Packeteer, Inc. changed its method of quantifying
financial statement errors in 2006.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of Packeteer, Inc.s internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report
dated March15, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of, and an adverse opinion on the
effective operation of, internal control over financial
reporting.   /s/KPMG

DESCRIPTION
OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES   DESCRIPTION
OF BUSINESS   Packeteer, Inc., along with its subsidiaries collectively
referred to herein as the Company,
Packeteer, we and us is a
provider of wide area network, or WAN, Application Delivery
systems designed to deliver a comprehensive set of visibility,
Quality of Service, or QoS, control, compression, application
acceleration and application service capabilities. Our product
family includes PacketShaper, iShared, SkyX and Mobiliti Client
products that can be deployed within large data centers, smaller
branch office sites and software clients on PCs for mobile and
Small Office/Home Office, or SOHO, users throughout a
distributed enterprise. We deliver superior application
performance and end user experience using an intelligent
overlay, which bridges applications and IP networks,
adapts to our customers existing infrastructure and
addresses the demands created by a changing application
environment in order to deliver high performance applications
across all WAN and Internet links. The Company was incorporated
on January25, 1996, and commenced principal operations in
1997, at which time the Company began selling its products and
related services. The Company currently markets and distributes
its products via a worldwide network of resellers, distributors
and systems integrators.   SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   BASIS
OF PREPARATION   The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.   USE OF
ESTIMATES   The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its
estimates, including those related to allowance for doubtful
accounts and sales returns, inventory valuation, rebate and
warranty reserves, valuation of long-lived assets, including
intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes and stock-based
compensation, among others. The Company bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.   REVENUE
RECOGNITION   Product revenues consist primarily of sales of the
Companys WAN Application Delivery systems, which include
hardware, as well as software licenses, to distributors and
resellers. Service revenues consist primarily of maintenance
revenue and, to a lesser extent, training revenue.   The Company applies the provisions of Statement of Position, or
SOP, 97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by
SOP98-9,
Modification of
SOP97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
Transactions, to all transactions involving the sale of
hardware and software products. Revenue is generally recognized
when all of the following criteria are met, as set forth in
paragraph8 of
SOP97-2   
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists   
delivery has occurred   
the fee is fixed or determinable,and   
collectibility is probable.   
46 Table of Contents   PACKETEER,
INC.
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Receipt of a customer purchase order is persuasive evidence of
an arrangement. Sales through the Companys distribution
channel are evidenced by an agreement governing the relationship
together with purchase orders on a
transaction-by-transaction
basis.   Delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common
carrier from Packeteer or its designated fulfillment house. For
certain destinations outside the Americas, delivery occurs when
product is delivered to the destination country. For maintenance
contracts, delivery is deemed to occur ratably over the contract
period.   Fees are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at the
inception of an arrangement and are negotiated at the outset of
an arrangement, generally based on specific products and
quantities to be delivered. In the event payment terms are
provided that differ significantly from the Companys
standard business practices, which are generally ninety days or
less, the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and
revenue is recognized as the fees become due and payable.   The Company assesses collectibility based on a number of
factors, including credit worthiness of the customer and past
transaction history of the customer.   Generally, product revenue is recognized upon delivery. However,
product revenue on sales to major new distributors are recorded
based on sell-through to the end user customers until such time
as the Company has established significant experience with the
distributors product exchange activity. Additionally, when
the Company introduces new product into its distribution channel
for which there is no historical customer demand or acceptance
history, revenue is recognized on the basis of sell-through to
end user customers until such time as demand or acceptance
history has been established.   The Company defers recognition of revenue on inventory in the
distribution channel in excess of a certain number of days. On
the same basis, the Company reduces the associated cost of
revenues, which is primarily related to materials, and includes
this amount in inventory. The Company recognizes these revenues
and associated cost of revenues when the inventory levels no
longer exceed expected supply. No amounts were deferred under
this policy at December31, 2006 or 2005.   The Company has analyzed all of the elements included in its
multiple element arrangements and has determined that it has
sufficient vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair
value to allocate revenue to the maintenance component of its
product and to training. VSOE is based upon separate sales of
maintenance renewals and training to customers. Accordingly,
assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met, revenue
from product sales is recognized upon delivery using the
residual method in accordance with
SOP98-9.
Revenue from maintenance is recognized ratably over the
maintenance term and revenue from training is recognized when
the training has taken place. To date, training revenues have
not been material.   SALES
RETURN RESERVES   Management makes estimates of potential future product returns
related to current period product revenue in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS 48,

OF REVENUES   Our cost of revenues consists of the cost of finished products
purchased from our contract manufacturers, overhead costs,
service support costs and amortization of purchased intangible
assets. The Company provides currently for the estimated costs
that may be incurred under product warranties when products are
shipped.   CASH
AND CASH EQUIVALENTS   The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase
to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist
primarily of cash on deposit with banks, money market
instruments and investments in commercial paper that are stated
at cost, which approximates fair market value.   INVESTMENTS   Management determines the appropriate classification of
investment securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates
such designation as of each balance sheet date. As of
December31, 2006 and 2005, all investment securities are
designated as
available-for-sale.
These
available-for-sale
securities are carried at fair value based on quoted market
prices, with the unrealized gains losses reported as a
separate component of stockholders equity. The Company
periodically reviews the realizable value of its investments in
marketable securities. When assessing marketable securities for
other-than temporary declines in value, we consider such factors
as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been
less than the cost basis, the market outlook in general and the
Companys intent and ability to hold the investment for a
period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery
in market value. If an other-than-temporary impairment of the
investments is deemed to exist, the carrying value of the
investment would be written down to its estimated fair value.   INVENTORIES   Inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are stated
at the lower of cost on a
first-in,
first-out basis or market. We record inventory write-downs for
excess and obsolete inventories based on historical usage and
forecasted demand. If future demand or market conditions are
less favorable than our projections, additional inventory
write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of
revenues in the period the revision is made. The Company
recorded write-downs of inventory of $568,000, $89,000 and
$86,000 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

663     11,045   Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on December1 in
a two-step process. First, the Company determines if the
carrying amount of its Reporting Unit exceeds the fair
value of the Reporting Unit, which would indicate that
goodwill may be impaired. If the Company determines that
goodwill may be impaired, the Company compares the implied
fair value of the goodwill, as defined by SFAS142,
to its carrying amount to determine if there is an impairment
loss. The Company does not have any goodwill that it considers
to be impaired.   In accordance with SFAS144, Accounting for
Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets, the Company
evaluates long-lived assets, including intangible assets other
than goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may
not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured
by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future
undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If
the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any
impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying
value and the fair value of the impaired asset.

For established programs, the Companys estimates for
rebates are based on historical usage rates. For new programs,
rebate reserves are calculated to cover the Companys
maximum exposure until such time as historical usage rates are
developed. When sufficient historical experience is established,
there may be a reversal of previously accrued rebates if actual
rebate claims are less than the maximum exposure. Additionally,
there may be a reversal of previously accrued rebate reserves if
rebates are not claimed before the expiration dates established
for each program.   WARRANTY
RESERVES   Upon shipment of products to its customers, the Company provides
for the estimated cost to repair or replace products that may be
returned under warranty. The Companys warranty period is
typically 12months from the date of shipment to the end
user customer. For existing products, the reserve is estimated
based on actual historical experience. For new products, the
required reserve is based on historical experience of similar
products until such time as sufficient historical data has been
collected on the new product and is included in other accrued
liabilities.

Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. To date, the Companys
software has been available for general release shortly after
the establishment of technological feasibility, which the
Company defines as a working prototype and, accordingly,
capitalizable costs have not been material.   STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION   The Company has adopted a stock incentive plan that provides for
the grant to eligible individuals of stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock purchase rights and
bonuses, restricted stock units, performance shares and
performance units. The Company also has an Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, or ESPP, which enables employees to purchase the
Companys common stock.   On January1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No123 revised 2004,
Share-Based Payment, SFAS123R
which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation
expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and
directors including employee stock options and employee stock
purchases related to the ESPP based on estimated fair values.
SFAS123R supersedes the Companys previous
accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB25. In March 2005, the
Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting
BulletinNo107 SAB107 relating
to SFAS123R. The Company has applied the provisions of
SAB107 in its adoption of SFAS123R. Using the
modified prospective transition method of adopting
SFAS123R, the Company began recognizing compensation
expense for stock-based awards granted or modified after
December31, 2005 and awards that were granted prior to the
adoption of SFAS123R but were still unvested at
December31, 2005. Under this method of implementation, no
restatement of prior periods has been made.   Stock-based compensation expense recognized under
SFAS123R in the consolidated statements of operations
for 2006 related to stock options and ESPP was
$121million and $12million, respectively. The
estimated fair value of the Companys stock-based awards,
less expected forfeitures, is amortized over the awards
vesting period using the graded vesting method. In addition, the
stock-based compensation expense for 2006 included $484,000
related to restricted stock issued in connection with the Mentat
acquisition that would have been included in the Companys
consolidated statements of operations under the provisions of
APB25. For 2005 and 2004, stock-based compensation expense
of $901,000 and $14,000, respectively, was related to the Mentat
acquisition. There was no stock-based compensation expense
related to stock options and ESPP recognized during 2005 and
2004. As a result of adopting SFAS123R, the
Companys income before provision benefit for income
taxes and net income for 2006 were reduced by $133million
and $92million, respectively. The implementation of
SFAS123R reduced basic and fully diluted earnings per
share by $026 for 2006. See Note7 for additional
information.   
52 Table of Contents   PACKETEER,
INC.
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   SFAS123R requires companies to estimate the fair value
of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an
option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that
is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the
requisite service periods in the Companys statements of
operations. Prior to January1, 2006, the Company measured
compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation
plans using the intrinsic value method under APB25 and
related interpretations. In accordance with APB25, no
stock-based compensation expense was recognized in the
Companys statements of operations for stock options
granted to employees and directors that had an exercise price
equal to the deemed fair value of the underlying common stock on
the date of grant.   Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the
Companys statements of operations in 2006 included
compensation expense for share-based payment awards granted
prior to, but not yet vested as of December31, 2005, based
on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
pro forma provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS123, as amended, and compensation
expense for the share-based payment awards granted subsequent to
December31, 2005 based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS123R.
As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the
consolidated statements of operations in 2006 is based on awards
ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated
forfeitures. SFAS123R requires forfeitures to be
estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in
subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
estimates. In the Companys pro forma information required
under SFAS123 for the periods prior to 2006, the Company
accounted for forfeitures as they occurred.   Prior to the adoption of SFAS123R, the Company presented
all tax benefits for deductions resulting from the exercise of
stock options and disqualifying dispositions as operating cash
flows on its consolidated statement of cash flows.
SFAS123R requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess
of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing
cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow. This
requirement reduced net operating cash flows and increased net
financing cash flows in 2006. Total cash flow remained unchanged
from what would have been reported under prior accounting rules.   On November10, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued FASB Staff Position
No.FAS123R-3 Transition Election Related to
Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards.
This FSP provides a practical transition election related to the
accounting for the tax effects of share-based payments awards to
employees, as an alternative to the transition guidance for the
additional paid-in capital pool, or APIC pool, in
paragraph81 of SFAS123R. The Company has elected
to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the FASB
Staff Position for calculating the tax effects of equity-based
compensation pursuant to SFAS123R.The alternative
transition method includes simplified methods to establish the
beginning balance of the APIC pool related to the tax effects of
employee stock-based compensation, and to determine the
subsequent impact on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statements

Stock Issued in Acquisition   In connection with the acquisition of Mentat, Inc., or Mentat,
in December 2004, the Company recorded deferred stock-based
compensation of approximately $16million associated with
the issuance of restricted shares. Beginning in 2006,
stock-based compensation expense related to purchase

over the remaining vesting periods. During 2006, the Company
recorded stock-based compensation expense of $484,000 related to
the acquisition and credited additional paid-in capital. Prior
to 2006, a portion of the purchase consideration for purchase
acquisitions was recorded as deferred stock-based compensation.

OF RISK   Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash, cash
equivalents, investments and accounts receivable. The
Companys cash, cash equivalents and investments are
maintained with highly accredited financial institutions and
investments are placed with high quality issuers. The Company
believes no significant concentration of credit risk exists with
respect to these financial instruments. Credit risk with respect
to trade receivables is limited as the Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers. Based on managements
evaluation of potential credit losses, the Company believes its
allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate.   A limited number of indirect channel partners have accounted for
a large part of our revenues to date and we expect that this
trend will continue. The following table provides details of

Technologies and Westcon accounted for 20% and 13% of gross
accounts receivable, respectively.   The Company principally relies on one, and to a lesser extent
three additional, contract manufacturers for all of its
manufacturing requirements. Any manufacturing disruption could
impair its ability to fulfill orders. The Companys
reliance on these third-party manufacturers for all its
manufacturing requirements could cause it to lose orders if
these third-party manufacturers fail to satisfy the
Companys cost, quality and delivery requirements.   INCOME
TAXES   The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting
for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are to
be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of
deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation
allowance for any tax benefits of which future realization is
uncertain.   FOREIGN
CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS   The Companys sales to international customers are
U.S.dollar-denominated. As a result, there are no foreign
currency gains or losses related to these transactions.   The functional currency for the Companys foreign
subsidiaries is the U.S.dollar. Accordingly, the entities
remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at period-end exchange
rates, while non-monetary items are remeasured at historical
rates. Income and expense accounts are remeasured at the average
rates in effect during the year.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Remeasurement adjustments are recognized in income as
transaction gains or losses in the year of occurrence. To date,
the effect of such amounts on net income has not been
significant.   OTHER
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS   The Company reports comprehensive income or loss in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income. SFAS130 establishes standards
for reporting comprehensive income and loss and its components
in financial statements. Other comprehensive income loss
consists entirely of unrealized gains losses on marketable
securities available for sale of $164,000, $25,000 and
$195,000 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Accordingly,
the accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of
December31, 2006 and 2005 related entirely to net
unrealized losses on marketable securities available for sale.
Tax effects of unrealized losses are not considered material for
any periods presented.   NET
INCOME PER SHARE   Basic net income per share has been computed using the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the
period, less the weighted-average number of common shares that
are subject to repurchase. Diluted net income per share has been
computed using the weighted average number of common and
potential common shares outstanding during the period, as
calculated using the treasury stock method.   For purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, weighted
average common share equivalents do not include stock options
with an exercise price that exceeded the average fair market
value of the Companys common stock for the period, as the
effect would be anti-dilutive. Additionally, all common share
equivalents are excluded from diluted earnings per share for
loss periods. Options to purchase shares of common stock that
were excluded from the computation were as follows in

OF ERRORS   In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting
BulletinNo108 SAB108, Considering the
Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, which
addresses how uncorrected errors in previous years should be
considered when quantifying errors in current-year financial
statements. SAB108 requires companies to consider both a
rollover method which focuses primarily on the
income statement impact of misstatements and the iron
curtain method which focuses primarily on the balance
sheet impact of misstatements when quantifying errors in
current-year financial statements and the related financial
statement disclosures. The transition provisions of SAB108
permit a company to adjust retained earnings accumulated
deficit for the cumulative effect of immaterial errors relating
to prior years. In the three months ended December31,
2006, we determined that errors had been made in our financial
statements related to the recording of rebate reserves,
resulting in an overstatement of rebate reserves of $500,000,
net of taxes of $150,000.   Historically, the Company has evaluated uncorrected differences
utilizing the rollover approach. The Company believes the impact
of these errors were immaterial to prior years under the
rollover method. However, under SAB108, which the Company
was required to adopt for the year ended December31, 2006,
the Company must assess materiality using both the rollover
method and the iron-curtain method. Under the iron-curtain
method, the cumulative impact of the errors related to the
rebate reserve are material to the Companys 2006 financial
statements and, therefore, the Company has recorded an
adjustment to its opening 2006 accumulated deficit balance in
the amount of $350,000 in accordance with the implementation
guidance in SAB108.

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An
Interpretation of FASB Statement No109,
FIN48. FIN48 clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises
financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement
No109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
FIN48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition
and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
in a tax return that results in a tax benefit. Additionally,
FIN48 provides guidance on de-recognition, statement of
operations classification of interest and penalties, accounting
in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. This
interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2006. The Company is evaluating the effect
that the adoption of FIN48 will have on its results of
operations and financial condition and is not yet in a position
to determine such effects.   In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No157, Fair Value
Measurement, FAS157. This Standard defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements. FAS157 is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
November15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal
years. The Company has not determined the effect that the
adoption of FAS157 will have on its consolidated results
of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

BUSINESS
COMBINATIONS   Acquisition
of Tacit Networks, Inc.   On May16, 2006, the Company completed its acquisition of
Tacit Networks, Inc., or Tacit, a privately held company
headquartered in South Plainfield, New Jersey. Tacit was a
developer of products that allow enterprises with multiple
locations to more efficiently store and transfer data between
remote sites and central data storage sites. The acquisition
expanded the Companys product offerings of branch office
infrastructure solutions that enable organizations pursuing
server, storage and resource consolidation to meet cost,
security and regulatory compliance objectives.   Tacit became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company in a
transaction accounted for using the purchase method. The Company
acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Tacit for an initial
purchase price of $680million in cash, including
acquisition costs of $17million. In addition, the Company
assumed all of the then outstanding options to purchase Tacit
common stock, and converted those into options to purchase
approximately 320,000shares of the Companys common
stock. In addition to the cash paid that is included in the
initial purchase price, the merger agreement required that
$785million of cash be placed in an escrow account to
secure Tacits obligations under certain representation and
warranty provisions. The escrow funds will be released fifteen
days following the later of 90days after completion of the
audit of the Companys 2006 financial statements or one
year from the closing date of the acquisition, at which time the
final purchase price will be adjusted.

compensation expense associated with the fair value of the

escrow funds are included in other non-current assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets and have not been

stockholders of Tacit, additional goodwill will be recorded. In
addition, adjustments may be made to the allocation of the

8,380   Goodwill   Approximately $491million of the initial purchase price
has been allocated to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess
of the purchase price over the fair value of the underlying net
tangible and intangible assets. The goodwill was attributed to
the premium paid to expand and quicken the combined
companys ability to serve the growing markets for Wide
Area File Services and branch office server solutions.
Management believes the acquisition positions the combined
company as a leading supplier of branch office server solutions
delivering network services, network data reductions and file
and bulk data caching. None of the goodwill recorded as part of
the Tacit acquisition will be deductible for United States
federal income tax purposes. Goodwill will be deductible for
state income tax purposes in those states in which the Company
elects to step up its basis in the acquired assets.   In accordance with SFASNo142, goodwill will not be
amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least
annually more frequently if certain indicators are present. In
the event that management determines that the value of goodwill
has become impaired, the Company would incur an accounting
charge for the amount of impairment during the period in which
the determination is made.   In-process
research and development   The Company estimates that $18million of the purchase
price represents in-process research and development,
IPRD, primarily related to projects associated with
Tacits iShared network wide area network, or WAN,
optimization technology including the hardware appliance and
the related software enhancements and upgrades that had not yet
reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future
use. The Companys methodology for allocating the purchase
price of acquisitions to IPRD was determined through
established valuation techniques in the high-technology
networking product industry. The fair value of the technology
under development, as well as the existing purchased technology,
was determined using the income approach, which estimates the
present value of future economic benefits such as cash earnings,
cost savings, tax deductions, and proceeds from disposition. The
present value calculations were developed by discounting
expected cash flows to the present value at a rate of return
that incorporates the risk-free rate for the use of funds, the
expected rate of inflation, and risks associated with the
particular investment. The discount rate of 19% selected was
generally based on rates of return available from alternative
investments of similar type and quality.   Net
deferred tax assets   Net deferred tax assets of $90million include tax effects
of fair value adjustments primarily related to intangible assets
and net operating loss tax carryforwards, net of a valuation
allowance of $17million, the benefit from which will be
allocated to goodwill when , and if, it is subsequently realized.

of Mentat   On December21, 2004, Packeteer acquired all of the
outstanding common stock of Mentat, a privately held company
located in Los Angeles, California. Mentat products are designed
to provide high performance networking solutions for satellite
and high-latency networks. The acquisition deepens and extends
Packeteers intellectual property and provides advanced
acceleration capabilities for new WAN performance solutions for
global customers.   The aggregate purchase price of Mentat was approximately
$191million, including acquisition costs. Of the
$191million, $173million was paid in cash upon
closing and the remaining $18million was paid to the
former shareholders of Mentat upon the collection of a non-trade
receivable. The non-trade receivable was collected in January
2005 and was immediately paid to the former shareholders of
Mentat per the terms of the purchase agreement. Our methodology
for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase
acquisitions is determined through established valuation
techniques in the high-technology networking industry. Goodwill
is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the
sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable
intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed. The

was assigned to developed technology, $19million to
customer contracts and relationships and $200,000 to trade name.
These intangible assets have useful lives ranging from one to
six years. Both the purchased intangible assets and the goodwill
are expected to be deductible for tax purposes.   In March 2005, an OEM customer of Mentat exercised its option to
buyout its license agreement. In accordance with the terms of
the license, for a total of $30million, the customer was
granted a perpetual, non-transferable and non-exclusive binary
and source code license to certain Mentat software plus support
and maintenance for a period of twelve months. The
$30million fee was initially recorded as deferred revenue
and revenue was recognized over the following twelve-month
period. In 2006 and 2005, Packeteer included $669,000 and
$23million, respectively, in revenues under this
arrangement, with no balance remaining in deferred revenue at
December31, 2006. A portion of the purchased intangible
asset Customer Contracts and Relationships was
related to this particular customer contract. The estimated
useful life on this portion of the intangible asset was reduced
from six years to one year and was fully amortized at
December31, 2006.   In addition, under the terms of the agreement, Packeteer was to
pay up to $37million in retention bonuses to former
Mentat employees including both cash and restricted stock to
incent Mentat employees to remain with Packeteer. The cash
bonuses, totaling approximately $20million were to be
paid to the Mentat employees in equal installments, one half one
year from the date of acquisition and the remainder on the two
year anniversary of the acquisition, so long as the employee
remains employed with Packeteer on each of the installment
dates. During 2006 and 2005, $690,000 and $870,000,
respectively, was paid to former Mentat employees under the cash
retention bonus plan. No amounts remain payable at
December31, 2006.   The restricted stock retention bonuses totaling approximately
114,000 restricted shares were valued at $17million;
however, approximately 4,000shares valued at $59,000 were
repurchased on the date of acquisition due to employee
terminations. Amortization of stock-based compensation expense
associated with these shares totaled $484,000, $901,000 and
$14,000 for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and

CONTINGENCIES   In November 2001, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York against the Company, certain officers and directors of
the Company, and the underwriters of the Companys initial
public offering. An amended complaint, captioned In re
Packeteer, Inc. Initial Public Offering Securities
Litigation, 01-CV-10185 SAS, was filed on April20,
2002.   The amended complaint alleges violations of the federal
securities laws on behalf of a purported class of those who
acquired the Companys common stock between the date of the
Companys initial public offering, or IPO, and
December6, 2000. The amended complaint alleges that the
description in the prospectus for the Companys IPO was
materially false and misleading in describing the compensation
to be earned by the underwriters of the Companys IPO, and
in not describing certain alleged arrangements among
underwriters and initial purchasers of the Companys common
stock. The amended complaint seeks damages and certification of
a plaintiff class consisting of all persons who acquired shares
of the Companys common stock between July27, 1999
and December6, 2000.   A special committee of the board of directors has authorized the
Company to negotiate a settlement of the pending claims
substantially consistent with a memorandum of understanding
negotiated among class plaintiffs, all issuer defendants and
their insurers. The parties have negotiated a settlement, which
is subject to approval by the Court. On February15, 2005,
the Court issued an Opinion and Order preliminarily approving
the settlement, provided that the defendants and plaintiffs
agree to a modification narrowing the scope of the bar order set
forth in the original settlement agreement. The parties agreed
to a modification narrowing the scope of the bar order, and on
August31, 2005, the Court issued an order preliminarily
approving the settlement. On December5, 2006, the United
States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned the
District Courts certification of the class of plaintiffs
who are pursuing the claims that would be settled in the
settlement against the underwriter defendants. Plaintiffs
informed the District Court that they intend to seek further
appellate review of this decision, and that they would like to
be heard by the District Court as to whether the settlement may
still be approved even if the the

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   decision of the Court of Appeals is not reversed. The District
Court indicated that it would defer consideration of final
approval of the settlement pending plaintiffs request for
further appellate review. We do not currently believe that the
outcome of this proceeding will have a material adverse impact
on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
No amount has been accrued as of December31, 2006, as we
believe a loss is neither probable nor estimable.   On June22, 2006, the Company filed a lawsuit in
SantaClara Superior Court against Valencia Systems, Inc.,
or Valencia, alleging Valencias breach of a Software
License and Development Agreement pursuant to which Valencia
provides certain software development and maintenance services
for the Company. This complaint followed an earlier arbitration
demand from Valencia pursuant to which Valencia claimed damages
of $3,000,000. The Company was granted injunctive relief in its
action prohibiting Valencia from disparagement or discontinuing
maintenance or support services. The court has ordered the
matter to arbitration and the parties have not yet formally
responded to the others allegations. Valencias
motion for a preliminary injunction was denied by the
arbitrator. The Company believes Valencias claims to be
without merit and intends to defend this matter vigorously.
However, this matter is in the early stages and the Company
cannot reasonably estimate an amount of potential loss, if any,
at this time. The results of litigation are inherently
uncertain, and there can be no assurance that the Company will
prevail. No amount has been accrued as of December31,
2006, as we believe a loss is neither probable nor estimable.   In addition, the Company is subject to examination of its income
tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other domestic
and foreign tax authorities, including a current examination by
the Internal Revenue Service for its 2003 and 2004 tax returns,
primarily related to its intercompany transfer pricing. The
Company regularly assesses the likelihood of outcomes resulting
from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its
provision for income taxes, and believe such estimates to be
reasonable.   The Company is routinely involved in legal and administrative
proceedings incidental to its normal business activities and
believes that these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

assets at December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net
long-term deferred tax assets of $192million and
$46million are included in other non-current assets at
December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A valuation
allowance has been provided to reduce the deferred tax asset to
an amount management believes is more likely than not to be
realized. Expected realization of deferred tax assets for which
a valuation allowance has not been recognized is based upon the
reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and taxable
income expected to be generated in the future. The net change in
the total valuation allowance in 2006 was an increase of
$16million, which is comprised of an increase in
valuation allowance of $17million for deferred tax assets
related to the acquisition of Tacit, offset by a
$01million release of valuation allowance for deferred
taxes attributable to employee stock deductions. The net change
in the total valuation allowance in 2005 was a decrease of
$25million, which is comprised of a release of valuation
allowance of $32million, partially offset by an increase
in valuation allowance for deferred tax assets attributable to
employee stock option deductions. The net change in the total
valuation allowance in 2004 was a decrease of $58million,
of which $24million related to release of valuation
allowance and $37million related to the utilization of
net operating loss carryforwards that previously had valuation
allowances established against them.   Approximately $163million of the valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets is attributable to employee stock option
deductions, the benefit from which will be allocated to
additional paid-in capital when, and if, it is subsequently
realized. Approximately $17million of the valuation
allowance is attributable to Tacit pre-acquisition net operating
losses and research credits, the benefit from which will be
allocated to goodwill when, and if, it is subsequently realized.   Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because it is
managements intention to indefinitely reinvest such
undistributed earnings outside the U.S.   At December31, 2006, the Company has net operating loss
carryforwards for federal, California and New Jersey income tax
purposes of approximately $585million, $100million
and $286million, respectively. If not utilized, the
federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in
2020, and the California net operating loss carryforwards will
begin to expire in 2012 and the New Jersey net operating loss
carryforwards will begin to expire in 2010. At December31,
2006, the Company had federal, California, New Jersey and
Canadian research credit carryforwards of approximately
$42million, $42million, $01million and
$08million, respectively. If not

to expire in 2011. The California research credit carryforwards
can be carried forward indefinitely. The New Jersey research
credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2020. The Canadian
research credits will begin to expire in 2015.   The Companys income taxes payable for federal, state and
foreign purposes have been reduced by the tax benefits from
employee stock options. The Company receives an income tax
benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market
value of the stock issued at the time of exercise and the option
price, tax effected. The net tax benefits from employee stock
option transactions were $28million in 2006, of which
$07million consisted of tax benefits from employee stock
option transactions related to fully vested options assumed in
the acquisition of Tacit and were reflected as a decrease to
goodwill and $21million were reflected as an increase to
addition paid-in capital in the Consolidated Statements of
Shareholders Equity. The net tax benefits from employee
stock option transactions were $12million in 2005, all of
which were reflected as an increase to additional paid-in
capital. No tax benefits from employee stock option transactions
were recorded in 2004.   The Company is undergoing an examination by the Internal Revenue
Service for its 2003 and 2004 tax returns, primarily related to
our intercompany transfer pricing. Management believes that
adequate amounts have been accrued for potential adjustments
resulting from the examination.

STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN   In May 1999, the Companys Board of Directors adopted and
its stockholders approved the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan 1999
Plan, which became effective on July27, 1999, and serves
as the successor program to its 1996 Equity Incentive Plan the
predecessor plan. All options outstanding under the Predecessor
Plan on the effective date were incorporated into the 1999 Plan
and were treated as outstanding options under the 1999 Plan. The
number of shares reserved under the 1999 Plan automatically
increases annually beginning on January1, 2000 by the
lesser of three million shares or 5% of the total number of
shares of common stock outstanding. Under the 1999 Plan, the
Company may grant incentive or nonstatutory stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock purchase rights and
bonuses, restricted stock units, performance shares and
performance units to eligible participants, including its
officers, other key employees, our non-employee directors and
certain consultants. The 1999 Plan is generally administered by
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which sets
the terms and conditions of the options and other awards.
Non-statutory stock options and incentive stock options are
exercisable at prices not less than 85% and 100%, respectively,
of the fair value on the date of grant. The options become 25%
vested one year after the date of grant with 1/48per month
vesting thereafter and expire at the end of 10years from
date of grant or sooner if terminated by the Board of Directors.
As of December31, 2006, an aggregate of approximately
147million shares have been reserved under the 1999 Plan,
of which approximately 32million were available for
future grant.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN   In May 1999, the Companys Board of Directors adopted the
1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP. The ESPP became
effective July27, 1999. The number of shares reserved
under the ESPP automatically increases annually beginning on
January1, 2000 by the lesser of one million shares or 2%
of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. The
ESPP permits participants to purchase common stock through
payroll deductions of up to 15% of an employees
compensation, including commissions, overtime, bonuses and other
incentive compensation. Purchases are limited to a maximum of
1,000shares for an individual employee for each purchase
period. The purchase price per share is equal to 85% of the fair
market value per share on the participants entry date into
the offering period or, if lower, 85% of the fair market value
per share on the semi-annual purchase date. As of
December31, 2006, approximately 48million shares
had been reserved under the plan and approximately
32million were available for future issuance. During
2006, 2005 and 2004, approximately 315,000, 299,000 and
297,000shares were issued under the ESPP during 2006.   RESTRICTED
STOCK ISSUED IN ACQUISITION   In connection with the acquisition of Mentat, the Company issued
approximately 114,000 restricted shares valued at
$17million, however, approximately 4,000shares
valued at $59,000 were repurchased on the date of acquisition
due to employee terminations. The value of the shares was
determined based on the fair value of the Companys stock
at the date of issuance. Under the terms of the related
shareholder agreements, the shares vest in equal installments,
one-third one year from the date of acquisition, one-third on
the second anniversary of the acquisition and one-third on the
third anniversary of the acquisition, so long as the employee is
still employed by Packeteer on the anniversary date. During
2005, approximately 10,000 of these restricted shares were
repurchased by the Company due to terminations, according to the
terms of the shareholder agreements. In 2006 and 2005,
approximately 48,000 and approximately 34,000shares
vested, respectively, including approximately 29,000shares
in 2006 that became immediately vested upon employee
terminations. At December31, 2006, there were
approximately 18,000 restricted shares outstanding.

SEGMENT
REPORTING   The Companys chief operating decision maker is considered

information presented on a consolidated basis substantially
similar to the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, the
Company has concluded that it operates in one segment and
accordingly has provided only the required enterprise-wide
disclosures.   The Company operates in the United States and internationally
and derives its revenue from the sale of products and software
licenses and maintenance contracts related to the Companys

CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES   
a
Conclusion
Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures   Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined
under
Rule13a-15e
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2006,
were ineffective to ensure that the information required to be
disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commissions rules and forms.   
b
Managements
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rules13a-15f
and
15d-15f
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control
over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   A material weakness within the meaning of PCAOB Auditing
Standard No2is a control deficiency, or
combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a
remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.   Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, and this
assessment identified material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting related to our
1accounting for income taxes and 2rebate
reserves. Specifically, iwe did not maintain effective
controls to provide for the reconciliation of the income taxes
payable account to supporting detail and the review of the
income taxes payable account reconciliation by someone other
than the preparer; and iiwe did not maintain effective
controls over the review of the rebate reserves as the review
was not appropriately designed, nor was the review conducted in
sufficient detail. These deficiencies resulted in a material
misstatement of our income taxes payable and the rebate
reserves, which were adjusted prior to the issuance of our 2006
consolidated financial statements.   In making its assessment of internal control over financial
reporting, management used the criteria issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO,
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Because of
the material weaknesses described above, managements
conclusion is that we did not maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006.   Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an
attestation report on managements assessment of our
internal control over financial reporting. That report is
included herein under Item8.   
c
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There has been no change in our internal control over financial
reporting during the three months ended December31, 2006
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. In order to remediate the material weaknesses
