INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT  The Board of Directors of Procom Technology, Inc.:  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Procom Technology, Inc. and subsidiaries as of July 31, 2001 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders equity and comprehensive loss and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended July 31, 2002. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement
schedule as of and for each of the years in the three-year period ended July 31, 2002. These consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Procom Technology, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of July 31, 2001 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended July 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

PROCOM TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1.Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies  Organization 
Procom Technology, Inc. the Company was incorporated in California in 1987. The Company develops, manufactures and markets network-attached storage NAS
appliances for computer networks and operating systems. The Company also sells disk storage upgrade systems, CD/DVD-Rom servers and arrays and tape backup products.  Basis of Presentation  The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Procom Technology, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The functional currencies of the European
subsidiaries are those of their respective countries. The Company incurred net foreign currency transaction losses of approximately $213,000 and $54,000 and a transaction gain of $85,000 for the years ended July31, 2000, 2001 and 2002,
respectively. The Company did not engage in hedging activities for any of these periods. The Company follows the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS 52 when translating assets and liabilities and results of
operations for each period presented.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  For statement of cash flow purposes, short term marketable securities with original maturities less than 90 days are considered cash
equivalents.  Financial Instruments  The Companys financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, income tax receivable and payable, trade accounts receivable and accounts payable, lines of
credit, flooring line obligation, and long term debt. The fair value of these instruments, excluding long term debt, approximates their financial statement carrying amounts due to their short maturities. The fair value of the long term debt
approximates its carrying value since the debt bears interest at a variable rate and changes in interest do not significantly impact the fair value of the debt.  Accounts Receivable  The allowance for doubtful accounts
represents managements estimate of the amount expected not to be collected on specific accounts and on other as yet unidentified accounts included in accounts receivable. The Company does not require collateral or other security for its sales
transactions. The allowance for sales returns represents managements estimates of anticipated sales returns relating to each reporting period.  Inventories  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis or market. Allowances for obsolete inventory are based on managements estimate of the amount considered obsolete based on specific reviews of inventory items. In estimating the allowance, management
relies on its knowledge of the industry including technological and design changes as well as its current inventory levels. The amounts the Company will ultimately realize could differ materially from amounts estimated by management. Inventory
includes product that is sent to potential customers on an evaluation basis. At July 31, 2002 and 2001, inventory related to evaluation units was $10 million and $12 million, net of valuation allowances, respectively. Revenue is not recorded for
evaluation systems until the customer has purchased these products. 
39 Table of Contents  PROCOM TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Income Taxes  The Company records income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date. Management evaluates the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based upon the amount of existing temporary differences, the period in which they are expected to be
recovered and expected levels of taxable income.  Long-Lived Assets  Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the respective estimated useful
lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the assets.  Expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized, while minor replacements, maintenance and repairs that do not extend the
assets lives are charged to operations as incurred. Upon sale or disposition, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the Companys accounts and any gain or loss is included in the statement of operations. Interest
of approximately $489,000, $142,000 and $0 has been capitalized during fiscal years 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively, and included in the cost of the Companys headquarters.  Long-lived assets, goodwill and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment in value based upon a comparison of undiscounted future operating cash flows to
the carrying value of the asset whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If this evaluation indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, the amount of the impairment is measured
as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. During fiscal 2002, the Company determined that the value of the goodwill, acquired workforce and developer relationships was impaired at its European
subsidiaries. The Company based the determination on the continued losses incurred at those subsidiaries, estimates of the future difficulties that a return to profitability would entail, and the resources that would be required to effect that
return to profitability. In addition, the Company determined that its strategy to improve and implement betterments in technologies acquired and had licensed would be changed to conserve existing cash resources. After making these determinations,
the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $24 million in fiscal year 2002.  Revenue
recognition and allowances  The Companys products include an operating system that is integral to the
overall product and its functionality. The Company recognizes revenue for NAS products in accordance with Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP 98-9, Software Revenue
Recognition with Respect to Certain Arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue for its NAS products when:  Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists.It is the Companys customary practice to have a purchase order prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement. 
40 Table of Contents  PROCOM TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Delivery Has Occurred.The
Companys product is physically delivered to its customers, generally with standard transfer terms of FOB shipping point. If undelivered products or services exist that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an
arrangement, delivery is not considered to have occurred. The core operating system software that the customer purchases is pre-installed and tested at the Companys facility prior to shipment and does not require significant production,
modification, or customization at the customers site; as such, the system is functional according to the Companys specifications at the time of shipment.  The Price Is Fixed or Determinable.Arrangements with extended payment terms are not considered to be fixed or determinable. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized
as the fees become due and payable.  Collection Is Probable.Probability of
collection is assessed on a customer-by-customer basis. Customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial position and ultimately their ability to pay. If it is determined from the outset of an
arrangement that collection is not probable based upon our review process, revenue is recognized when realized.  The Company recognizes revenue on multiple element arrangements using the residual method. Under the residual method, revenue is recognized when Company-specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered
elements in the arrangement, but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement. At the outset of the arrangement with the customer, the Company defers revenue for the fair value of the undelivered elements such as
consulting services and product support and upgrades and recognizes the revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements initially delivered when the basic criteria in SOP 97-2 have been met. Revenue from consulting
services is recognized as the related services are preformed. Revenue from support and upgrade contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the support period of one to three years.  Revenue from sales of the Companys non NAS products is recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements. The revenue recognition criteria of SAB 101 are consistent with the NAS policies described above.  The Companys product evaluation program enables the customer to receive appliances on a trial basis and return the appliances within a specified period, generally 30-60 days. The period may be extended if the customer needs
additional time to evaluate the product within the customers particular operating environment. Revenue is not recorded for evaluation systems until the customer has purchased these products.  Cost of Sales  The Companys cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of components produced by its suppliers, such as disk drives, cabinets, power supplies, controllers and CPUs, its direct and indirect labor expenses and related
overhead costs such as rent, utilities and manufacturing supplies and other expenses. In addition, cost of sales includes third party license fees, warranty expenses and allowances for excess and obsolete inventory.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling expenses include costs directly associated with the selling process such as salaries and commissions of sales personnel, marketing, direct and cooperative
advertising and travel expenses. General and administrative expenses include the Companys general corporate expenses, such as salaries and benefits, rent, utilities, bad debt expense, legal and other professional fees and expenses,
depreciation and amortization. Advertising expense was $14 million, $08 million and $03 million during the years ended July 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. 
41 Table of Contents  PROCOM TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Research and Development Expenses  Research and development expenses consist of the costs associated with software and hardware development. Specifically, these costs
include employee salaries and benefits, consulting fees for contract programmers, test supplies, employee training and other related expenses.  Software development costs are charged to research and development expense in the period the costs are incurred until technological feasibility is established. The Company has not capitalized any
software development costs as technological feasibility is generally not established until a working model is completed at which time substantially all development is complete. All other research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  Concentration of Credit Risk  Three customers accounted for approximately 54% and 34% of the Companys total net accounts receivable on July 31, 2001 and 2002, respectively. The loss of any one of
the Companys significant customers could have an adverse effect on the Companys business.  Net Loss
per Common Share  Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares that would
be outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and warrants is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury-stock method.  Due to the net losses in fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002, no effect is given to the potential common stock because the effect would be
antidilutive. Approximately 1,184,000, 922,000 and 381,000 shares would have been included in the computation of diluted earnings per share if a net loss had not been incurred in fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively.  Stock Based Compensation  The Company measures stock based compensation for option grants to employees and members of the board of directors using a method which assumes that options granted at market price at the date of grant
have no intrinsic value. Proforma net loss and net loss per share are presented in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements as if the fair value method had been applied.  Stock options issued to non-employees are recorded at the fair value of the stock options at the performance commitment date.

Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business
Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS No. 141, all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 must be accounted for using the purchase method. Under SFAS No142, which is
effective for fiscal year 2003, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. In fiscal 2002, the Company determined that
all of its existing goodwill and other intangible assets had been impaired, and the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $24 million. Accordingly, upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company will not have any net goodwill or other
intangible assets.  In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Assets to Be
Disposed Of. Adoption of SFAS No. 144 is required for our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2002. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting SFAS No. 144 on our financial position and results of operations and have not yet
determined the impact of adopting this statement.  In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 supersedes previous accounting guidance, principally Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring.  SFAS No. 146 requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be initially measured at fair value and recognized when the liability is incurred. In periods subsequent to initial measurement, changes
to the liability are measured using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate that was used in the initial measurement of the liability recorded. The cumulative effect of a change resulting from revisions to either the timing or the amount of estimated
cash flows is recognized as an adjustment to the liability in the period of the change and charged to the same line items in the statement of operations used when the related costs were initially recognized. Under EITF No. 94-3, a liability for an
exit cost was recognized at the date of the companys commitment to an exit plan.  The provisions of SFAS No.
146 are required to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. We believe SFAS No. 146 may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs, as well as the amounts recognized, depending on
the nature of the exit or disposal activity.

A valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset has been
provided as management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of the existing net deferred tax asset at July 31, 2002. The Company claimed no benefit in the current provision for some $11,302,000 in
operating losses at its foreign subsidiaries. If those subsidiaries generate taxable income in future periods, the Company may realize a tax benefit for these operating losses.  At July 31, 2002, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $7,135,000 and $23,262,000, respectively,
which are available to offset future taxable income, if any, through 2022 and 2015, respectively, subject to an annual statutory limitation.  At July 31, 2002, the Company had tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purpose of approximately $2,017,000 and $973,000, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards are
available to offset future tax liability, if any, through 2022. Utilization of the carryforwards may be limited under Internal Revenue Code Section 382.  The Job Creation and Workers Assistance Act of 2002, signed by the President in February 2002, permits the Company to carry back certain of its net deferred operating losses for 5 years instead
of only 2 years. The Company previously had not believed it would be able to recover a tax benefit related to its prior year losses. As a result of the legislation, in April 2002, the Company filed amended tax returns for prior year losses, and in
June 2002, the Company received a tax refund of $29 million. In addition, in August 2002, the Company received approximately $21 million in additional tax refunds when the Company filed its fiscal 2002 tax return, and carried fiscal 2002 operating
losses back to previous periods. The Company anticipates that it will receive an additional refund of approximately $02 million. The Company has recorded in the current year a tax benefit of $52 million.

Goodwill and other intangibles relate to two acquisitions completed
by the Company in fiscal 1998, two acquisitions completed in fiscal 1999 and one acquisition completed in fiscal 2001. Goodwill and other intangibles had been amortized on a straight line basis over four to seven years. In fiscal 2000, 2001 and
2002, amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was $167,000, $340,000 and $480,000, respectively. At July 31, 2002, the remaining value of goodwill was determined to be impaired, and as a result, was written off.  6.Lines of Credit, Long-Term Debt and Convertible Debenture  On July 31, 2000, the Company had established a revolving line of credit with Finova Capital Corporation. The line had been based on a percentage of the Companys
eligible accounts receivable and inventory, up to a maximum of $10,000,000. In early October 2000, the Company paid off all amounts outstanding under the Finova line of credit and replaced it with the line of credit with CIT Business Credit.
On October 10, 2000, the Company entered into a three-year working capital line of credit with The CIT
Group/Business Credit CIT. The working capital line of credit allows for the Company to borrow, on a revolving basis, for a period of three years, a specified percentage of its eligible accounts receivable approximately $18 million
at July 31, 2002, up to a limit of $50 million or the line will be terminated. Amounts outstanding under the working capital line bear interest at the lenders prime rate plus 25%. At July 31, 2002, no amounts were outstanding under the
working capital line of credit. The line of credit accrues various monthly maintenance, minimum usage and early termination fees. The line of credit is collateralized by certain assets of the Company. The line of credit requires certain financial
and other covenants, including the maintenance of a minimum EBITDA requirement for rolling 12-month periods ending on each fiscal quarter. For the twelve month period ended on July 31, 2002, the Company was not in compliance with the minimum EBITDA
requirement. The lender has not waived the Companys non-compliance with this covenant for this period and the Company cannot borrow under the line.  On October 31, 2000, the Company issued a $150 million convertible unsecured debenture to a private investor. The debenture carried interest at 60% per annum, and was repayable in full on October 31,
2003, unless otherwise converted into the common stock of the Company. In connection with the issuance of the debenture, the Company issued to the investor a 5-year warrant to purchase up to 32,916 shares of its common stock at an initial exercise
price of $3255 per share, with the number of shares for which the warrant is exercisable and the exercise price subject to antidilution adjustments. The value of the warrant of $562,000 was computed using the Black-Scholes model, with the following
assumptions: Expected life5 years, Risk free interest rate6%, and Volatility120. In the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company paid the investor the remaining principal amount of the debentures and expensed the remaining
unamortized debt issuance and warrant costs of $274,000 to interest expense. 
47 Table of Contents  PROCOM TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
In November 2001, the Company borrowed $875 million under a financing arrangement secured by the
Companys corporate headquarters. The principal amount outstanding bears interest at prime plus 10% per annum, but not less than 70% per annum. Under certain conditions, the Company has the right to request that portions of the principal
amount outstanding under the note shall bear interest at a LIBOR based rate, but not less than 70%. As of July 31, 2002, the interest rate on the loan was 70%. Principal payments of $14,400 plus accrued interest are due monthly with the remaining
principal balance and unpaid interest due at the maturity date of January 1, 2007. Up to an additional $10 million may be borrowed under this financing arrangement to cover leasing costs and tenant improvements on the vacant, unimproved space
within the corporate headquarters upon finding a qualified tenant. At July 31, 2002, the outstanding principal balance of the loan totaled $86 million. Under the terms of the loan agreement, the lender may immediately accelerate all amounts
disbursed under the loan agreement and terminate any further obligation of the lender to disburse additional amounts under the financing arrangement if there exists any event or condition that the lender in good faith believes impairs or is
substantially likely to impair the prospect of payment or performance by the Company of its obligations under the applicable loan documents.  The Company has a flooring line with IBM Credit, which at July 31, 2002 had committed to make $20 million in flooring inventory commitments available to the Company. In September 2002, IBM Credit
notified the Company that the credit line was being reduced to $05 million, effective immediately. In addition, prior to November 18, 2002, the Company is required to provide IBM Credit with an irrevocable letter of credit totaling $05 million. As
of July 31, 2001 and July 31, 2002, the Company owed $531,000 and $251,000, respectively, under the flooring line. The flooring line is collateralized by the specific inventory purchased using the flooring line. CIT and IBM Credit have entered into
an intercreditor agreement which determines the level of priority of either lenders security interest. The flooring line requires the maintenance by the Company of a minimum net worth of $160 million. The Company was in compliance with the
net worth covenant of the flooring line at July 31, 2002. The flooring line also requires the Company not to be in default of any covenants in the CIT agreement. IBM Credit has waived noncompliance with that covenant at July 31, 2002, but IBM Credit
has notified the Company of the changes to IBMs relationship with the Company, as discussed above.  The
Companys foreign subsidiaries in Germany, Italy and Switzerland have lines of credit with banks in their respective countries that are utilized primarily for overdraft and short-term cash needs. At July 31, 2002, the amount outstanding under
these lines was $46,000.  In October 2000, the Company repaid an 18-month loan payable to an investment bank of
$1075 million. The loan, which originally matured in September 2000 but was subsequently renewed for an additional 6-month period, carried rates ranging from 6125% to 74%.  7.Commitments and Contingencies  Lease Commitments  At July 31, 2001, the Company leases facilities under non-cancelable
operating leases in Germany, Italy, Canada, France and China. In addition, the Company has various operating leases for certain office equipment and vehicles.

third parties intellectual property rights. The Company was notified in fiscal 2001 that its products may infringe some of the intellectual property rights of Intel. Intel has offered the Company a non-exclusive license for patents in the
Intel portfolio. The Company has investigated the Intel claims, and has had negotiations with Intel. While the outcome of claim resolution or litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that none of the pending claims or
litigation will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations.  Employment Agreements  In May 2002, the employment of three executives of the Company was
terminated. Pursuant to agreements executed between the Company and the executives, one of the executives will receive monthly payments of $18,750 for 36 months following termination, one will receive monthly payments of $18,750 for 30 months
following termination, and the third will receive monthly payments of $18,750 for 30 months following termination and monthly payments of $37,500 for six months after the last such $18,750 monthly payment. Each former executive will be entitled to
participate in the Companys employee benefit, health and other insurance plans for the 36 months following their termination. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $19 million for the present
value of the remaining unpaid severance and employee benefits which is included in payable to related parties.  8.Retirement Plan  The Company has a defined contribution plan
covering substantially all full-time employees with more than one year of service. Each participant can elect to contribute up to 15% of his or her annual compensation. While employer contributions to the plan are discretionary, during fiscal 2000,
2001 and 2002 the Company elected to make matching contributions equivalent to between 38% and 50% of the first 4% of each eligible employees contribution. Total expense for fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002 was $86,000, $82,000 and $66,000,
respectively.  9.Related Party Transactions  In fiscal 2001 and 2002, the Company utilized the services of Advanced Construction Solutions, Inc. ACS, an Orange County based real estate developer and general
contractor to a locate a suitable facility for the Company to utilize as its corporate headquarters for approximately 18 months, b act as a general contractor to complete a build-out of necessary tenant improvements for the temporary facility,
and c locate, and then
49 Table of Contents  PROCOM TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
negotiate the purchase of, and commence development of, a parcel of land in Irvine, California for the Companys long-term corporate headquarters. ACS is owned 50% by a brother of Frank
Alaghband, a Director of the Company. The Company also agreed to utilize ACS in the construction of the Irvine facility. The Company has expended approximately $77 million for construction costs through July 31, 2002. A majority of the construction
costs were paid to ACS.  10.Stock Option Plan and Employee Stock Purchase Plan  During fiscal 1996, the Company instituted the 1995 Stock Option Plan the 1995 Plan for its key employees. Pursuant to the
terms of the 1995 Plan, options to purchase the Companys common stock may be granted with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. Options expire ten years from the date of the grant and generally vest
over a period of four years.  The following table is a summary of stock option activity for the three years ended

Pro forma information regarding net loss and net loss per share is
required by SFAS 123 as if the Company had accounted for its stock options under the fair value method of SFAS 123. The fair value of the Companys stock options was estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The fair value of
the Companys stock options granted to employees was $928, $584 and $024 in fiscal 2000, fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002, respectively, and was estimated assuming no expected dividends and the following weighted average assumptions:

In fiscal 1999, the Company adopted an employee stock purchase plan
ESPP that operates in accordance with Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code whereby eligible employees may, subject to certain limitations, authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of their salary to purchase shares of the
Companys common stock at 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the first or last date of semiannual purchase periods, whichever is less. The Company has reserved 250,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Approximately

12.Acquisitions  On
December 28, 2000, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Scofima Software S.r.l., a company organized under the laws of Italy Scofima, in exchange for 480,000 shares of the Companys common stock.
Pursuant to its agreement with the former shareholders of Scofima, the Company registered for resale by those shareholders the shares issued to them in the acquisition. Scofima had an option to acquire a software system designed as a caching and
content distribution solution. Immediately prior to the Companys acquisition of Scofima, Scofima exercised its option, and acquired the software system. The purpose of the software is to provide functionalities that are necessary for the
content delivery market of the internet. The software had been in development for approximately 2-3 years, involving 5 programmers and system developers. The software was not complete at the date of acquisition, and was not yet determined to be
technologically feasible. The Company issued 480,000 shares valued at $12 per share and incurred approximately $250,000 in acquisition costs in exchange for the outstanding shares of Scofima. Scofima had net assets of approximately $500,000 at the
date of acquisition. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase of assets. The Company employed an appraiser to identify the values of the assets acquired, including, among other assets, certain in-process research and development costs. The
amount of purchase price allocated to in-process research and development was determined by estimating the stage of development of the software, estimating future cash flows from projected revenues, and discounting those cash flows to present value.
The discount rate applied was 25%. The incremental product sales resulting from the products incorporating the software were estimated to be $44 million over the initial four years of sales with sales growing from approximately $15 million in the
initial year to $134 million in the fourth year. The appraiser concluded, and the Company has determined that approximately $43 million of the purchase price was related to the Companys research and development efforts
52 Table of Contents  PROCOM TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
that had not attained technological feasibility and for which no future alternative use was expected. The Company has expensed the value of the research and development as of the date of the
acquisition of Scofima and capitalized the fair value of the other assets acquired as determined and allocated by the Company, with assistance from the appraiser, including the value of the assembled workforce of approximately $02 million and
developer relationships valued at $01 million, which are being amortized over 4 years, with the remainder of $14 million assigned to goodwill, which is being amortized over 4 years. The following is a summary of the net fair value of the assets
acquired, the liabilities assumed, and the total consideration paid for Scofima:   Net fair value of assets acquired

Proforma financial information has not been provided due to the
limited operations of Scofima. Revenue and net income were approximately $3,000 and $100, respectively, for the ten months ended October 31, 2000 and were approximately $6,000 and $800, respectively for the year ended December 31, 1999. Total assets
were approximately $120,000 at both October 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999.  13.Impairment Losses
At July 31, 2002, as a result of the Companys change in business strategy, the Company decided to
restructure the operating activities of its subsidiaries in Switzerland, Germany and Italy. The shift in business strategy consists of selling products primarily through value added resellers VARs instead of a direct sales force or reliance on the
Companys historical distributors. In addition, the Company no longer emphasizes sales of non-NAS products throughout Germany and Switzerland.  In fiscal 1999, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Procom Technology, AG Switzerland, a relatively small Swiss distributor of computer storage peripherals, in exchange for 28,500
shares of stock and $22,000 in cash. The goodwill associated with the purchase totaled approximately $168,000, which was being amortized over seven years, with approximately $80,000 in unamortized goodwill at July 31, 2002, prior to any adjustment.
In addition, in fiscal 1998, the Company acquired all the outstanding shares of Megabyte Computerhandels AG Germany, a German distributor of high-end networking solutions, in exchange for 104,144 shares of stock valued at approximately $900,000.
The goodwill associated with the purchase totaled approximately $713,000, which was being amortized over seven years, with approximately $240,000 in unamortized goodwill at July 31, 2002, prior to any adjustment. The restructuring of both
subsidiaries consisted of significantly reducing the direct sales force. As a result of the restructuring, the Company reviewed the long-lived assets purchased in both acquisitions. After comparing the carrying value of the assets to the estimated
future undiscounted cash flows from the assets, the Company determined that the value of the goodwill and certain fixed assets were impaired. As a result, the Company wrote off the remaining goodwill and certain fixed assets of approximately
$470,000.  In fiscal 1999, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Procom Technology, SPA Italy, a
relatively small Italian distributor of higher-end computer storage peripherals. The goodwill associated with the purchase totaled approximately $286,000, which was being amortized over seven years, with approximately $190,000 in unamortized
goodwill at July 31, 2002, prior to any adjustment. The restructuring consisted of significantly reducing the direct sales force. As a result of the restructuring, the Company reviewed the long- lived assets purchased in the acquisition. After
comparing the carrying value of the assets to the estimated future
53 Table of Contents  PROCOM TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
undiscounted cash flows from the assets, the Company determined that the value of the goodwill may be impaired. As a result, the Company wrote off the remaining goodwill of approximately
$190,000.  In December, 2000, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Scofima Software S.r.l., in
exchange for 480,000 shares of the Companys common stock. As a result of the acquisition, the Company acquired a software system designed as a caching and content distribution solution. At the acquisition date, the software had been in
development for approximately 2-3 years, involving 5 programmers and system developers, but had not yet determined to be technologically feasible. Approximately $1,741,000 was allocated at the time of acquisition to goodwill, assembled workforce,
developer relationships and software licenses. Currently, the Company does not anticipate allocating the resources required to complete the software and incorporate it into future products. Accordingly, the carrying values of the Scofima assets
exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. As a result, the Company wrote off the associated remaining goodwill and intangibles assembled workforce, developer relationships and software licenses totaling approximately $1,257,000.
In fiscal 2000, the Company entered into a licensing agreement with an independent software development company,
acquiring source code for a file system which totaled $500,000. Although the Company had allocated software programmers to further develop the existing code, and prepare it for release with the Companys products, the Company does not currently
intend to continue to allocate the required resources to this product. As a result, the Company wrote off prepaid license fees of $500,000.  14.Quarterly Statements of Operations Unaudited

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the Companys operating results included an increase in inventory reserves of $17 million, an increase in accounts
receivable reserves of $22 million, a severance accrual of $19 million, $10 million charge relating to the settlement agreement with the former shareholders of Scofima Software and impairment losses of $24 million. 
15.NASDAQ Delisting Notice  In July 2002, the Company received a notice from NASDAQ stating that the Company did not, for a period of 30 consecutive days, meet the $1 minimum bid price per share
requirement for continued listing on the
54 Table of Contents  PROCOM TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
NASDAQ National Market. The Notice further stated that the Company had until October 21, 2002 to comply with the minimum bid price per share requirement for continued listing. On October 18,
2002, the Company applied to transfer the listing of the Companys stock to the NASDAQ Small Cap Market. If this transfer is approved, the Company would be eligible for an additional 90 days, or until January 18, 2003, to demonstrate compliance
with the $1 minimum bid price for a period of 10 consecutive trading days. The Company expects to retain the trading symbol PRCM on the Small Cap Market. However, there can be no assurance that NASDAQ will grant the Companys
request to transfer the listing of the Companys stock to the Small Cap Market.  16.Subsequent Events
In December 2000, the Company acquired Scofima Software, S.r.l., an Italian company. One of the former
shareholders of Scofima Software became the Managing Director of European Sales for the Company. The consideration issued in the transaction was 480,000 shares of the Companys Common Stock and the Company agreed, as part of the acquisition, to
register the shares for resale under the Securities Act of 1933. The shares of Common Stock issued in the transaction were registered for resale but the former Scofima Software shareholders alleged, among other things, that delays in the
registration of the shares caused them to incur substantial losses. On October 4, 2002, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the former Scofima Software shareholders under which these individuals released any and all claims against
the Company arising from the transaction in return for a payment of $970,000, of which $560,000 was paid upon execution of the agreement and the remaining balance to be paid through February 2003. The settlement was charged to expense and included
in payable to related parties on the balance sheet at July 31, 2002.  On September 20, 2002, a putative class
action complaint styled Albert Ree v. Alex Aydin, Alex Razmjoo, and Procom Technology, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Case No. 02 CV 7613. Two weeks later, on October 4, 2002, a
putative class action complaint styled Gary Squires v Alex Aydin, Alex Razmjoo, and Procom Technology, Inc. was also filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Case No. 02 CV 7952. The allegations of the
two complaints are identical. Both actions are purportedly brought on behalf of all investors who purchased the Companys common stock from December 9, 1999 to September 20, 2000. Although both complaints have been filed with the District
Court, neither has been served.  The complaints allege violations of Section 10b and 20a and Rule 10b-5 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that the Company violated federal securities laws by: 1 failing to fully and timely disclose purported problems with the Companys alliance with Hewlett-Packard
along with the effect of such problems on the Companys business prospects, and 2 overstating the Companys receivables during the class period. For relief, plaintiffs seek compensatory damages and/or rescission from the Company as well
as an award of the costs and disbursements of the suit. The Company believes that it has substantial and meritorious defenses to each of the claims and intends to vigorously defend the actions. However, there can be no assurance that the Company
will prevail in defending these actions. The Companys defense of these actions may result in the diversion of managements time and attention and cause the Company to incur potentially significant legal expenses. If the Company is
unsuccessful in defending these actions, the Company may be required to pay damages in an amount that would have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial condition.  17.Liquidity and Capital Resources  For the year ended July 31, 2002, the Company incurred a net loss of $244 million and used cash in operating activities of $133 million. At July 31, 2002, the Company has working capital of $166
million and cash and cash equivalents of approximately $108 million. The Company believes it has sufficient resources to
55 Table of Contents  PROCOM TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
continue as a going concern through at least July 31, 2003. To reduce its cash used in operations, the Company put in place various cost containment initiatives, both domestically and
internationally, during fiscal 2002, including an additional reduction in headcount of 37 employees in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.  The Companys plan to address its liquidity issues is to generate cash flow from operations by increasing sales and cutting costs. It is reasonably possible in the near-term that the Company will be unable to generate
cash flows from operations, increase its sales or further reduce costs sufficiently to provide positive cash flows from operations. If the Company is not able to generate positive cash flows from operations, the Company will need to consider
alternative financing sources including the sale or refinancing of the Companys headquarters.  Under the
terms of the Companys long-term debt, the lender may immediately accelerate all amounts disbursed and terminate any further obligation of the lender to disburse additional amounts under the financing arrangement if there exists any event or
condition that the lender in good faith believes impairs or is substantially likely to impair the Companys ability to repay the obligations under the financing arrangement. There can be no assurance that the lender will not accelerate the
payment of all amounts disbursed under the arrangement. In this event, it is reasonably possible in the near-term, that the Company would be able to sell or refinance the building, if necessary, or otherwise obtain any additional financing, on
favorable or any terms.
