REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Innovasive Devices, Inc.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Innovasive Devices, Inc. and its subsidiary at December 31, 1997 and 1996, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. PRICE WATERHOUSE LLP

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In thousands, except share data 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company is engaged in the research, development, manufacture and
distribution of medical devices focused on less invasive, arthroscopic
surgical repair, and restoration of traumatized or diseased tissue. The
Company products are sold to customers in the healthcare industry primarily
in the U.S.  REVENUE RECOGNITION, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Revenue is recognized upon shipment of product. Ongoing credit evaluations
of customers' financial condition are performed and collateral is not
required. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable
is limited due to the number of customers comprising the Company customer
base. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses and such
losses, in the aggregate, have not exceeded management expectations.  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.  CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity
of three months or less to be cash equivalents and those with maturities
greater than three months are considered to be marketable securities.
Marketable securities are stated at amortized cost plus accrued interest,
which approximates fair value. Cash equivalents and marketable securities
consist primarily of corporate debt securities, U.S. government agency
obligations and money market instruments.  The Company accounts for its investments in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Under the provision of SFAS No.
115, the Company has classified its investments as available-for-sale and
any associated unrealized gains or losses, if material, are recorded as a
separate component of equity until realized. At December 31, 1997 and 1996,
any unrealized gains or losses were immaterial.  INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being
determined using the first-in, first-out method.  FIXED ASSETS
Fixed assets are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line
method over their estimated useful lives. Repair and maintenance costs are
expensed as incurred.
26
INNOVASIVE DEVICES, INC.          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued
In thousands, except share data  GOODWILL
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets
acquired, and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful life of ten years.  Accumulated amortization at December 31, 1997
totaled $77.  BASIC AND DILUTED NET LOSS PER SHARE
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
128, Earnings per Share, which supersedes Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 15 and specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure
requirements of earning per share. SFAS No. 128 requires the presentation of
basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is
computed by dividing the income available to common stockholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. For
purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, the denominator includes
both the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potential
dilutive common shares outstanding for the period. The Company adopted SFAS
No. 128 in the fourth quarter of 1997. All prior periods earnings per share
amounts have been restated to comply with SFAS No. 128.
For each of the years presented, basic and diluted earnings per share are
the same due to the antidilutive effect of potential common shares
outstanding. Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from the 1997,
1996 and 1995 computation include 1,505,608, 732,536 and 478,878 common
shares, respectively, issuable upon the exercise of stock options.
Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from the 1995 computation also
includes 3,374,274 common shares issuable upon the conversion of redeemable
convertible preferred stock.
In February 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 98, which supersedes SAB No. 83 and includes
new guidance with respect to the calculation of earnings per share in an
initial public offering IPO and reporting of historical earnings per
share. SAB No. 98 now requires the reporting of historical earnings per
share for all periods prior to an IPO, even in situations where the entities
capital structure was not indicative of the ongoing entity. The Company had
previously reported earnings per share for periods through June 1996 the
closing of the Company IPO on a pro forma basis. The Company adopted SAB
No. 98 in February 1998, accordingly, pro forma earnings per share previously
reported for 1996 and 1995 have been eliminated and replaced with historical
earnings per share.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Stock-based compensation awards to employees under the Company stock plans
are accounted for using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
and related interpretations. The Company has adopted the disclosure
requirements of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.

In thousands, except share data  USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingencies at December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the three years in the period ended December 31,
1997. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
2. ACQUISITION
On June 27, 1997, the Company, through a newly formed subsidiary, acquired
substantially all of the operating assets of MedicineLodge, Inc. MLI, in
exchange for 1,885,000 shares of the Company common stock valued at $14,326
and the assumption of certain liabilities. MLI designs, develops,
manufactures and is in the early stages of marketing proprietary surgical
implants which facilitate the repair of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament ACL
of the knee. The acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method
and, accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated based on the
estimated fair value of assets purchased and liabilities assumed upon
acquisition. A portion of the purchase price relating to research projects
which had not yet reached technological feasability and had no alternative
future use, was allocated to in-process research and development, resulting
in a charge to the Company operations of $13,370. The excess of cost over
the fair value of net assets acquired goodwill of $1,403 is being amortized
over 10 years on a straight-line basis. The operating results of MLI are
included in the Company results from the date of acquisition.
The following unaudited pro forma summary combines the results of operations
of the Company and MLI as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of
1997 and 1996, after giving effect to certain adjustments, including the
write-off of purchased in-process research and development and amortization
of goodwill. The unaudited pro forma summary does not necessarily reflect the
results of operations as they would have been if the Company and MLI had
constituted a single entity during such periods.                             YEAR ENDED

Deferred income taxes reflect the tax impact of temporary differences between
the amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations. Under SFAS No. 109, the
benefit associated with future deductible temporary differences is recognized
if it is more likely than not that a benefit will be realized. Based on
historical evidence of net losses, the Company has recorded a valuation
allowance that offsets all net deferred tax assets. Principal components of
the deferred tax assets and liabilities included on the balance sheet at
December 31, 1997 and 1996 were as follows                                DECEMBER 31,

In thousands, except share data   The Company has U.S. Federal net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $151 million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately
$282. The operating loss and tax credit carryforwards expire in the years
2009 through 2012.
An ownership change, as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code,
resulting from the Company initial public offering in June 1996, will
limit the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards
generated prior to June 1996 to approximately $39 million per year.
Subsequent significant ownership changes could, however, further limit the
utilization of these carryforwards in future years. 9. MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK
In February and March 1994, the Company issued 4,260,337 shares of Series A
mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock Series A Preferred

interest of $107.
In October 1995, the Company issued 3,271,000 shares of Series B mandatorily
redeemable convertible preferred stock Series B Preferred Stock. Upon
issuance, the Company received net proceeds of $6 million and converted
notes payable in the amount of $1 million which was issued in August 1995 in
the form of a bridge loan.
In January 1996, the Company issued an additional 442,235 shares of Series B
Preferred Stock, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $927.   All shares of Series A and Series B Preferred Stock converted into 3,543,819
shares of common stock at the conversion ratio of 225 shares of Preferred
Stock for each share of common stock upon the closing of the Company
initial public offering in June 1996. 10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY   REVERSE COMMON STOCK SPLIT
A 1-for-225 reverse stock split of the Company common stock became
effective on May 7,1996. All shares of common stock, options and per share

In thousands, except share data  An aggregate of 50,000 shares of common stock is reserved for issuance
pursuant to the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Stock Purchase
Plan. Employees whose customary employment is in excess of 20 hours per
week and five months per year and who own less than 5% of stock in the
Company are eligible to participate in the plan. Employees participating in
the plan will have the opportunity to purchase common stock at a price equal
to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value on the date the right was
granted or 85% of the fair market value on the date the right was exercised.
The Company issued 9,500 shares to employees participating in the plan in
1997.  Compensation cost based upon the fair value approach as prescribed under SFAS
No. 123 has not been recognized for the stock options granted to employees as
the Company adopted the disclosure-only provision of SFAS No. 123. Had
compensation for the Company stock plans been determined based on the fair
value at the grant date for awards in 1997, 1996 and 1995 consistent with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company net loss and net loss per share
would have been as follows 
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
1997    1996    1995
Net Loss:
As reported                   $19,154  $4,062  $ 3,734

Pro forma                      239   085   206
The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the grant date using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions for 1997, 1996 and 1995: expected option term of five years;
dividend yield of 0%; risk free interest rate of 57 %, 62 % and 56% in
1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively; and expected volatility of 0% for options
granted prior to the initial filing of the Company registration statement
in April 1996, 55% for options granted from April 1996 to December 1996 and
44%-55% for options granted from January 1997 through December 1997. The
weighted average fair value per option for options granted in 1997, 1996 and
1995 was $1035, $246 and $044, respectively.
Because options vest over several years and additional option grants are
expected to be made in subsequent years, the pro forma impact on 1997, 1996
and 1995 is not representative of the pro forma effects of reported net
income loss and net income loss per share for future years.
During 1997, the Company granted options in the amount of 154,000 shares to
nonemployees under the Omnibus Plan. The estimated fair value of these
options totaled $470, was recorded as deferred compensation and is being
amortized over the vesting period of the options. In November 1997, the
Emerging Issues Task Force of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
finalized Issue No. 96-18 Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued
to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods
or Services EITF 96-18. Under EITF 96-18, the compensation expense that
will ultimately be recognized for certain of the options issued to
nonemployees in 1997 will be measured at the vesting date of the underlying
options.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued
In thousands, except share data   The Company has recorded deferred compensation at a preliminary value of
$341 for 131,500 of these options which have not vested as of December
31, 1997. As these options vest over periods of one to four years, the
Company will be required to remeasure the fair value of these options at
each reporting period prior to vesting and then finally at the vesting date
of the options. Changes in the estimated fair value of these options will be
recognized as compensation expense in the period of the change. 12. RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN
The Company provides an employee retirement savings plan under Section
401k of the Internal Revenue Code the Plan which covers substantially
all employees. Under the terms of the Plan, employees may contribute a
percentage of their salary, up to a maximum of 15%, which is then invested
in one or more of several mutual funds selected by the employee. The Company
may make contributions to the Plan at its discretion; no contributions have
been made since inception of the Plan. 13. SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
For 1996 and 1995, sales approximating 13% of total sales for both years
were attributable to one customer. No customer accounted for greater than
10% of net sales for 1997.
