a In 1997, PPL Electric Utilities arranged for the issuance of a total of
$250 million of company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities of subsidiary trusts holding solely company debentures by PP
Capital Trust and PP Capital Trust II, two Delaware statutory business
trusts. These preferred securities are supported by a corresponding amount
of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued by PPL
Electric Utilities to the trusts. PPL Electric Utilities owns all of the
common securities, representing the remaining undivided beneficial
ownership interest in the assets of the trusts. The proceeds derived from
the issuance of the preferred securities and the common securities were
used by PP Capital Trust and PP Capital Trust II to acquire $103
million and $155 million principal amount of Junior Subordinated Deferrable
Interest Debentures, Subordinated Debentures respectively. PPL Electric
Utilities has guaranteed all of the trusts' obligations under the preferred
securities. The proceeds of the sale of these preferred securities were
loaned by PPL Electric Utilities to PPL for the tender offer for PPL
Electric Utilities preferred stock.
b The preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or
in part, upon the repayment of the Subordinated Debentures at maturity or
their earlier redemption. At the option of PPL Electric Utilities, the
Subordinated Debentures are redeemable on and after April 1, 2002 for the
820% securities and July 1, 2002 for the 810% securities in whole at
any time or in part from time to time. The amount of preferred securities
subject to such mandatory redemption will be equal to the amount of related
Subordinated Debentures maturing or being redeemed. The redemption price is
$25 per security plus an amount equal to accumulated and unpaid
distributions to the date of redemption.

May 1, 2006, but will be required to be surrendered by the existing holders
on May 1, 2001 either through the exercise of the call option by the
callholder or, if such option is not exercised, through the automatic
exercise of a mandatory put by the trustee on behalf of the bondholders.
e In August 1999 PP Transition Bond Company issued $242 billion of
transition bonds to securitize a portion of PPL Electric Utilities'
stranded costs. The bonds were issued in eight different classes, with
expected average lives of 1 to 87 years. On December 27, 1999, a $297
million bond principal payment was made on Class A-1 bonds.
The accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part
of the financial statements. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Terms and abbreviations appearing in Notes to Financial Statements are
explained in the glossary.
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Business and Consolidation
At December 31, 1999, PPL was the parent holding company of PPL Electric
Utilities, PPL Global, PPL Montana, PPL Gas Utilities, PPL Capital Funding, PPL
Spectrum, H.T. Lyons, McClure, McCarl and Western Mass. Holdings.
The financial condition and results of operations of PPL Electric Utilities
including its subsidiary PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Global are currently the
principal factors affecting PPL financial condition and results of operations.
PPL Electric Utilities generates electricity, provides electricity delivery
service in eastern and central Pennsylvania, sells retail electricity throughout
Pennsylvania and deregulated markets, and trades or markets wholesale energy in
the United States and Canada. PPL Global develops electricity generation and
delivery projects worldwide.
PPL consolidates the financial statements of its affiliates when it has
majority ownership and control. All significant intercompany transactions have
been eliminated. Minority interests in operating results and equity ownership
are reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of all
controlled affiliates on a current basis, with the exception of PPL Global
investments in Emel and EC, which are included on a one-month lag. PPL Global
investment in WPD formerly SWEB is accounted for using the equity method and
reported on a one-month lag. PPL Global has a 51% equity ownership interest in
WPD but lacks voting control. See Note 3. Less than 50% owned affiliates are
accounted for using the equity method, reported on a one-quarter lag. These
reporting lags are required because financial statements from these investments
are not timely for PPL Global to apply the equity method currently.
When ownership interest in an affiliate increases through a series of
acquisitions and subsequently results in control, as was the case for PPL
Global investments in Emel and EC, the equity method of accounting ceases to
apply. In accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin 51, Consolidated
Financial Statements, the affiliate results are included in the consolidated
financial statements as though it were acquired at the beginning of the year.
The portion of the affiliate earnings owned by outside shareowners prior to
PPL achieving control is included in Minority Interest on the Consolidated
Statement of Income.
Reclassification
Certain amounts in the 1998 and 1997 financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the current presentation. The Consolidated Balance
Sheet has been reclassified, with components presented in order of liquidity. This change recognizes the increasing
significance of PPL unregulated activities. The Consolidated Statement of
Shareowner Common Equity has also been reclassified in connection with SFAS
130, Reporting Comprehensive Income.
Earnings Per Share
SFAS 128, Earnings Per Share, requires the disclosure of basic and
diluted EPS. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing earnings available to common
shareowners Net Income on the PPL Consolidated Statement of Income by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. In the
calculation of diluted EPS, weighted average shares outstanding are increased
for additional shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive
securities were converted to common stock. In April 1999, PPL made its initial
award of stock options under its Incentive Compensation Plan. See Note 13 to
Financial Statements. Stock options are the only potentially dilutive
securities outstanding, but had no impact on 1999 EPS. For the twelve months
ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, the weighted average shares outstanding in
thousands were 152,287 and 164,651, respectively.
Management Estimates
These financial statements were prepared using management best estimates
of existing conditions. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Accounting Records
The accounting records for PPL Electric Utilities and PPL Gas Utilities are
maintained in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by the
FERC and adopted by the PUC.
Regulation
Historically, PPL Electric Utilities accounted for its operations in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 71, which requires rate-regulated
entities to reflect the effects of regulatory decisions in their financial
statements. PPL Electric Utilities discontinued application of SFAS 71 for the
generation portion of its business, effective June 30, 1998. PPL Gas Utilities
continues to be subject to SFAS 71. Electric Utility Plant in Service
Following are the classes of PPL Electric Utility Plant in Service with
associated accumulated depreciation reserves, at December 31, 1999 and 1998
millions of dollars               Transmission
and
Distribution  Generation   General    Total
December 31, 1999:
Basis             $ 3,836    $ 6,837    $  415    $11,088
Accumulated Depreciation    1,374    4,485     156    6,015
$2,462    $ 2,352    $  259    $ 5,073
December 31, 1998:

Accumulated Depreciation    1,216    4,750     160    6,126
$2,179    $ 1,601    $  223    $ 4,003
Electric Utility Plant in Service is recorded at original cost, unless
impaired, in which case the plant basis is reduced to its estimated fair
value. Property, plant and equipment acquired is recorded at the fair market
value at acquisition date. Generation plant is reflected at the lower of cost or
market value, as these assets are no longer subject to the provisions of SFAS
71. The other classes of Electric Utility Plant in Service, as well as items
capitalized subsequent to an acquisition, are recorded at historical cost.
AFUDC is capitalized as part of the construction costs for regulated
projects. Capitalized interest is recorded for generation-related projects.
The cost of repairs and replacements are charged to expense as incurred for
non-regulated projects. When regulated property, plant and equipment is
retired, the original cost plus the cost of retirement, less salvage, is charged
to accumulated depreciation. When entire regulated operating units are sold or
non-regulated plant is retired or sold, the costs of such assets and the related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and the gain or
loss, if any, is included in income, unless otherwise required by the FERC.
Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of property using
various methods including the straight-line, composite, and group methods. PPL
Electric Utilities' provisions for depreciation, as a percent of average gross
depreciable property, approximated 21% in 1999, 37% in 1998 and 38% in 1997.
Amortization of Goodwill
Goodwill, which is included in Regulatory Assets and Other Non-Current
Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, is amortized on a straight-line basis
over a 40-year period. Goodwill capitalized as part of PPL Global investments
in unconsolidated affiliates is also being amortized over a 40-year period. Nuclear Decommissioning and Fuel Disposal
An annual provision for PPL Electric Utilities' share of the future cost to
decommission the Susquehanna station, equal to the amount allowed for ratemaking
purposes, is charged to depreciation expense. Such amounts are invested in
external trust funds which can be used only for future decommissioning costs.
See Note 9.
Recoverable Transition Costs
Based on the PUC Final Order, PPL Electric Utilities was amortizing its
competitive transition or stranded costs over an eleven-year transition period
beginning January 1, 1999 and ending December 31, 2009. In August 1999,
competitive transition costs of $2402 billion were converted to intangible
transition costs when securitized by the issuance of transition bonds. The
intangible transition costs are being amortized over the life of the transition
bonds - August 1999 through December 2008, in accordance with an amortization
schedule filed with the PUC. The remaining competitive transition costs are
also being amortized based on an amortization schedule previously filed with the
PUC, adjusted for those competitive transition costs that were converted to
intangible transition costs. As a result of the conversion of a significant
portion of the competitive transition costs into intangible transition costs,
amortization of substantially all of the remaining competitive transition costs
will occur in 2009.
Liability for Above Market NUG Contracts
At June 30, 1998, PPL Electric Utilities recorded an estimated liability
for above market contracts with NUGS. Effective January 1999, PPL Electric
Utilities began reducing this liability as an offset to Energy Purchases on
the Consolidated Statement of Income. This reduction is based on the estimated
timing of the purchases from the NUGs and projected market prices for this
generation. This accounting will continue through 2014, when the last of the
existing NUG contracts expires.
Accounting for Price Risk Management
PPL engages in price risk management activities for both energy trading and
non-trading activities as defined by EITF 98-10, Accounting for Contracts
Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities. In 1999, PPL
entered into commodity forward and financial contracts for the physical purchase
and sale of energy as well as energy contracts that can be settled financially.
In 1998, these instruments were reflected in the financial statements using the
accrual method of accounting. As of January 1, 1999, PPL adopted mark-to-market
accounting for energy trading contracts, in accordance with EITF 98-10, and
gains and losses from changes in market prices are reflected in Energy
Purchases on the Consolidated Statement of Income.
PPL will continue to use EITF 98-10 to account for its commodity forward
and financial contracts until it adopts SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities effective on January 1, 2001. At that time,
PPL will change the accounting for any of its outstanding contracts that qualify as derivatives under SFAS 133.
PPL and PPL Electric Utilities entered into forward starting swaps and
treasury locks to hedge the interest rate risk associated with debt issuances.
The gains or losses on these swaps have been deferred and are being recognized
over the life of the debt, in accordance with SFAS 80, Accounting for Futures
Contracts.
PPL or its subsidiaries also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts
to hedge future cash flows for firm transactions and commitments and to hedge
economic exposures such as anticipated dividends and projected asset sales or
acquisitions when there is a high degree of certainty that the exposure will be
realized. Until PPL adopts SFAS 133, market gains and losses are recognized in
accordance with SFAS 52, Foreign Currency Translation, and are included in
accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Leases
Leased property of PPL Electric Utilities capitalized on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet consists solely of nuclear fuel. Future lease payments for
nuclear fuel are based on the quantity of electricity produced at the
Susquehanna station. These payments are expected to approximate $50 to $59
million per year through 2004. The maximum amount of nuclear fuel available for
lease under current arrangements is $200 million. Payments on other leased
property, which are classified as operating leases, are projected at $28 million
per year through 2004. These leases included vehicles, personal computers and
other equipment.
Revenue Recognition
Electric, Natural Gas and Propane, and Wholesale Energy Marketing and
Trading revenues are recorded based on deliveries through the end of the
calendar month.
Energy-Related Businesses revenue includes PPL Global, PPL Spectrum, and
the mechanical contracting and engineering subsidiaries. PPL Global revenue
reflects its proportionate share of affiliate earnings under the equity method
of accounting, as described in the Business and Consolidation section of this
Note 1. PPL Spectrum and the mechanical contracting and engineering
subsidiaries record profits from construction contracts on the percentage-of-
completion method of accounting. Under the percentage-of-completion method, the
relationship of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs of the contracts
is applied to total income to be derived from the contracts. Income from time
and material contracts is recognized currently as the work is performed. Costs
include all direct material and labor costs and job-related overhead.
Provisions for estimated loss on uncompleted contacts, if any, are made in the
period in which such losses are determined. Income Taxes
The provision for PPL Electric Utilities' deferred income taxes for
regulated assets is based upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates
established by the PUC and FERC. The difference in the provision for deferred
income taxes for regulated assets and the amount that otherwise would be
recorded under generally accepted accounting principles is deferred and included
in taxes recoverable through future rates on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
See Note 8.
PPL Electric Utilities deferred the investment tax credits when utilized,
and is amortizing the deferrals over the average lives of the related assets.
PPL and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return.
Pensions and Other Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits
The subsidiaries of PPL have noncontributory pension plans covering
substantially all employees. Funding is based on actuarially determined
computations that consider the amount deductible for income tax purposes and the
minimum contribution required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974.
The company also provides for certain health care and life insurance
benefits for retired employees and inactive employees covered by disability
plans. See Note 14 for details presented in conformity with SFAS 132
Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits.
Cash Equivalents
All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of
three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income,
defined as changes in common equity from transactions not related to
shareowners. For PPL Electric Utilities, other comprehensive income consists of
unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities and the excess of
additional pension liability over unamortized prior service costs. The other
comprehensive income of PPL consists of the foregoing as well as foreign
currency translation adjustments recorded by PPL Global. In accordance with
SFAS 130, comprehensive income is reflected on the Consolidated Statement of
Shareowners' Common Equity, and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income is
presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The accumulated other comprehensive income of PPL at December 31, 1999
consists of in millions: foreign currency translation adjustments, $50;
unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities, $1; and adjustments to
minimum pension liability, $6. Accumulated other comprehensive income was not
significant at December 31, 1998. Treasury Stock
Treasury shares are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as an
offset to common equity under the cost method of accounting. Management has no
definitive plans for the future use of these shares. Treasury shares are not
considered outstanding in calculating earnings per share.
Foreign Currency Translation
All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at
period-end exchange rates. Income and expense items are translated at average
exchange rates prevailing during the relevant periods. The resulting translation
adjustments are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income. Gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized
in income currently.
2. Segment and Related Information
PPL principal business segment is PPL Electric Utilities, which in
conjunction with PPL EnergyPlus provides electricity delivery service in

million at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The most significant
investment was PPL Global investment in WPD, which was $303 million at
December 31, 1999 and $373 million at December 31, 1998. At December 31, 1999
PPL Global had a 51% equity ownership interest in WPD but lacked voting
control. Accordingly, PPL Global accounts for its investment in WPD and other
investments where it has majority ownership but lacks voting control, under the
equity method of accounting. The December 31, 1998 balance included PPL Global
$243 million investment in Emel and EC. In 1999 PPL Global acquired a
controlling interest in these affiliates, and consolidated their financial results. See Note 1 for additional information regarding
consolidation.
Investments in unconsolidated affiliates at December 31, 1999, and the
effective equity ownership percentages, are as follows   Bolivian Generating Group, LLC - 293%

PPL Electric Utilities' restructuring proceeding under Pennsylvania Customer
Choice Act. Among other things, that Order.  permitted PPL Electric Utilities to recover $297 billion on a net
present value basis in stranded costs over 11 years - i.e., from
January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2009. PPL Electric Utilities'
stranded costs are those which would have been recoverable under
traditional rate regulation, but may not be recoverable in the
competitive marketplace. PPL Electric Utilities was permitted a return
of 1086% on the unamortized balance of these stranded costs.  authorized PPL Electric Utilities to issue transition bonds to
securitize up to $285 billion of its stranded costs. In      August 1999, PP Transition Bond Company issued $242 billion of
transition bonds.  required PPL Electric Utilities to reduce rates to all retail
customers by four percent effective January 1, 1999 through December
31, 1999.  required PPL Electric Utilities to unbundle its retail electric rates
beginning on January 1, 1999, to reflect separate prices for the
transmission and distribution charges, the CTC, the ITC, and the
generation charge. The CTC is a charge paid by all customers who
receive delivery service from PPL Electric Utilities, to recover PPL
Electric Utilities' stranded costs. The ITC, which offsets the CTC on
customer bills, is a charge paid by delivery customers to reflect the
securitization of stranded costs.  required PPL Electric Utilities to transfer its retail marketing
function to a new subsidiary, PPL EnergyPlus. PPL EnergyPlus has a PUC
license to act as a Pennsylvania EGS. This license permits PPL
EnergyPlus to offer retail electric supply to participating customers
in PPL Electric Utilities' service territory and in the service
territories of other Pennsylvania utilities. In 1999, PPL EnergyPlus
offered energy to industrial and commercial customers in Pennsylvania
and in other states that have opened their markets to competitive
suppliers.  permitted, but did not require, PPL Electric Utilities to transfer
ownership and operation of its generating facilities to a separate
corporate entity at book value.
5. Securitization
In August 1999, PP Transition Bond Company issued $242 billion of
transition bonds to securitize a portion of PPL Electric Utilities' stranded
costs. The bonds were issued in eight different classes, with expected average
lives of 1 to 87 years. PP Transition Bond Company, a special purpose
Delaware limited liability company, was formed for the purpose of purchasing and
owning ITP, and pledging its interest in ITP to a trustee to collateralize
transition bonds. The assets of PP Transition Bond Company, including the
ITP, are not available to creditors of PPL or PPL Electric Utilities. The
transition bonds are obligations of PP Transition Bond Company and are non-
recourse to PPL and PPL Electric Utilities.
PPL Electric Utilities used a portion of the securitization proceeds to
acquire equity held by PPL, including $380 million of preferred stock and $481
million of common stock. In addition, PPL Electric Utilities used a portion of
the proceeds to repurchase $1467 billion of its first mortgage bonds through
tender offers and open market purchases. In August 1999, PPL Electric Utilities
recorded an extraordinary charge of $59 million for the premiums and related
expenses to extinguish this first mortgage debt. See Note 6 for additional
information.
PPL used $417 million of the proceeds it received from PPL Electric
Utilities to purchase 14 million shares of its common stock.   PPL Electric Utilities' customers will benefit from securitization through
an expected average rate reduction of approximately one percent for the period
the transition bonds are outstanding. With securitization, a substantial portion
of the CTC has been replaced with an ITC, which passes 75% of the net financing
savings back to customers. The actual reduction will vary by year, by customer
class and by level of use.
In December 1999, the PUC approved PPL Electric Utilities' calculation of
ITC under-recoveries for the period from August through November 1999. PPL
Electric Utilities calculated ITC under-recoveries of $145 million for this
period. The PUC accepted rates proposed by PPL Electric Utilities to implement
new ITC rates to collect these under-recoveries in 2000.
6. Extraordinary Items
PUC Restructuring and FERC Settlement
Historically, PPL Electric Utilities prepared its financial statements for
its regulated operations in accordance with SFAS 71, which requires rate-
regulated companies to reflect the effects of regulatory decisions in their
financial statements. PPL Electric Utilities deferred certain costs pursuant to
rate actions of the PUC and the FERC and recovered, or expected to recover, such
costs in electric rates charged to customers.
The EITF addressed the appropriateness of the continued application of SFAS
71 by entities in states that have enacted restructuring legislation similar to
Pennsylvania Customer Choice Act. The EITF came to a consensus on Issue No.
97-4, Deregulation of the Pricing of Electricity - Issues Related to the
Application of FASB Statements 71 and 101, which concluded that an entity
should cease to apply SFAS 71 when a deregulation plan is in place and its terms
are known. For PPL Electric Utilities, with respect to the generation portion
of its business, this occurred effective June 30, 1998 based upon the outcome of
the PUC restructuring proceeding. PPL Electric Utilities adopted SFAS 101 for
the generation side of its business. SFAS 101 required a determination of
impairment of plant assets performed in accordance with SFAS 121, and the
elimination of all effects of rate regulation that were recognized as assets and
liabilities under SFAS 71.
PPL Electric Utilities performed impairment tests of its electric
generation assets on a plant specific basis and determined that $2388 billion
of its generation plant was impaired at June 30, 1998. Impaired plant was the
excess of the net plant investment at June 30, 1998 over the present value of
the net cash flows during the remaining lives of the plants. Annual net cash
flows were determined by comparing estimated generation sustenance costs to
estimated regulated revenues for the remainder of 1998, market revenues for 1999
and beyond, and revenues from bulk power contracts. The net cash flows were
then discounted to present value.
In addition to the impaired generation plant, PPL Electric Utilities
estimated that there were other stranded costs totaling 1989 billion at June 30, 1998. This primarily included generation-related
regulatory assets and liabilities and an estimated liability for above-market
purchases under NUG contracts. The total estimated impairment described above
was $4377 billion. The PUC Final Order in the restructuring proceeding,
entered on August 27, 1998, permitted the recovery of $2819 billion through the
CTC on a present value basis, excluding amounts for nuclear decommissioning and
consumer education, resulting in a net under-recovery of $1558 billion. PPL
Electric Utilities recorded an extraordinary charge for this under-recovery in
June 1998.
Under FERC Order 888, 16 small utilities which had power supply agreements
with PPL Electric Utilities signed before July 11, 1994, requested and were
provided with PPL Electric Utilities' current estimate of its stranded costs
applicable to these customers if they were to terminate their agreements in
1999. Subject to certain conditions, FERC-approved settlement agreements
executed with 15 of these customers provide for continued power supply by PPL
Electric Utilities through January 2004. As a result of these settlements, PPL
Electric Utilities, in the second quarter of 1998, recorded an extraordinary
charge in the amount of $56 million.
The extraordinary items related to the PUC restructuring proceeding and the
FERC settlement are reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income, net of
income taxes.
Details of amounts written-off in June 1998 were as follows millions of
dollars                                  
Impaired generation-related assets                 $ 2,388

PPL Electric Utilities believes that the electric transmission and
distribution operations continue to meet the requirements of SFAS 71 and that
regulatory assets associated with these operations will continue to be recovered
through rates from customers. At December 31, 1999, $309 million of net
regulatory assets, other than the recoverable transition costs, remain on PPL
Electric Utilities' books. These regulatory assets will continue to be
recovered through regulated transmission and distribution rates over periods
ranging from one to 30 years.
Extinguishment of Debt
SFAS 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt, requires
that a material aggregate gain or loss from the extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary item, net of the
related income tax effect.
As explained in Note 5, PPL Electric Utilities repurchased $1467 billion
of first mortgage bonds in August 1999, using the proceeds from the issuance of
transition bonds. PPL Electric Utilities recorded an extraordinary charge of $59
million for the premiums and related expenses to reacquire these first mortgage
bonds. Details of this extraordinary charge were as follows millions of
dollars

The extraordinary charge related to extinguishment of debt was partially
offset in December 1999 with a credit relating to wholesale power activity.
7. Sales to Other Electric Utilities
PPL Electric Utilities provided JCP with 189,000 kilowatts of capacity
and related energy from all of its generating units during 1999. This agreement
terminated on December 31, 1999. PPL Electric Utilities is reselling the
returning capacity and energy through its Energy Marketing Center. Under a
separate agreement, PPL Electric Utilities is providing additional capacity and
energy to JCP This capacity and energy sale increased from 200,000 kilowatts
to 300,000 kilowatts in June 1999 and continues at this level through May 2004.
Prices for this capacity and energy are market-based.
In August 1999, the FERC approved new interconnection and power supply
agreements between PPL Electric Utilities and UGI. Under the new power supply
agreement, effective August 1999, UGI purchases capacity from PPL Electric
Utilities equal to UGI PJM capacity obligation less the capacity reserve value
of UGI owned generation and an existing power purchase agreement. In 2000,
UGI will purchase a firm block of energy in addition to the capacity. The
agreement terminates in February 2001.
PPL Electric Utilities provides BG with 129,000 kilowatts, or 66%, of
its share of capacity and related energy from the Susquehanna station. Sales to
BG will continue through May 2001.
8. Income and Other Taxes
For 1999, 1998 and 1997 the corporate federal income tax rate was 35%, and
the PA corporate net income tax rate was 999%.   The tax effects of significant temporary differences comprising PPL net

9.  Nuclear Decommissioning Costs
PPL Electric Utilities' most recent estimate of the cost to decommission
the Susquehanna station was completed in 1993 and was a site-specific study,
based on immediate dismantlement and decommissioning of each unit following
final shutdown. The study indicated that PPL Electric Utilities' 90% share of
the total estimated cost of decommissioning the Susquehanna station is
approximately $724 million in 1993 dollars. The estimated cost includes
decommissioning the radiological portions of the station and the cost of removal
of nonradiological structures and materials. The operating licenses for Units 1
and 2 expire in 2022 and 2024, respectively.
Decommissioning costs have been historically charged to operating expense
and have been based upon amounts included in customer rates. Beginning in 1998,
decommissioning costs have been reclassified as a component of depreciation
expense. Beginning in January 1999, in accordance with the PUC Final Order, decommissioning costs will be recovered
from customers through the CTC over the 11 year life of the CTC rather than the
remaining life of Susquehanna. The recovery will include a return on unamortized
decommissioning costs. Decommissioning charges were $27 million in 1999 and $12
million in 1998 and 1997.
Amounts collected from customers for decommissioning, less applicable
taxes, are deposited in external trust funds for investment and can be used only
for future decommissioning costs. The market value of securities held and
accrued income in the trust funds at December 31, 1999 and 1998 were
approximately $255 million and $206 million, respectively. The trust funds
experienced, on a fair market value basis, a $26 million net gain in 1999, which
included net unrealized appreciation of $21 million, and a net gain in 1998 of
$31 million, which included net unrealized appreciation of $26 million. The
trust fund activity is reflected in the nuclear plant decommissioning trust fund
and in other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Accrued
nuclear decommissioning costs were $260 million and $209 million at December 31,
1999 and 1998, respectively.
In February 2000, the FASB issued another exposure draft on the accounting
for liabilities related to closure and removal of long-lived assets, including
decommissioning of nuclear power plants. As a result, current industry
accounting practices for decommissioning may change, including the possibility
that the estimated cost for decommissioning could be recorded as a liability at
the present value of the estimated future cash outflows that will be required to
satisfy those obligations.
10. Financial Instruments
During 1999, PPL and PPL Electric Utilities entered into forward starting
interest rate swaps and treasury locks with various counterparties to hedge the
interest rate risk associated with anticipated debt issuances, including the
issuance of transition bonds in August 1999. All financial instruments
associated with hedging the interest rate risk of the transition bonds were
settled at the end of July. Proceeds of $248 million were received and deferred
on the balance sheet in August, and will subsequently be amortized over the life
of the transition bonds using the effective interest rate method. Seventy-five
percent of these savings are being passed back to customers. On the same day
that PPL Electric Utilities priced its transition bonds, it entered into short-
dated treasury lock transactions with a notional amount of $107 billion to lock
in the treasury rate related to its offer to purchase any or all of $166
billion of selected series of its first mortgage bonds. These contracts were
settled one week later for an amount that was not significant. See Note 5 for
additional information about transition bonds.
In October 1999, PPL settled $170 million of notional amount of swaps in
connection with the issuance of medium-term notes as described in Note 11. PPL
received net proceeds from these settlements of about $9 million. This amount
has been deferred on the balance sheet and will subsequently be amortized over the life of the medium-
term notes using the effective interest rate method.
At December 31, 1999, PPL had also entered into forward-starting interest
rate swap agreements with various counterparties to hedge the interest rate risk
associated with debt issuances expected in the first quarter of 2000. These
interest rate swap agreements involve the future exchange of floating rate
interest payments for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the
agreements. PPL agreed to pay fixed rates between 588% - 706% on notional
amounts of $105 billion, with maturity dates between February 15, 2005 and
March 31, 2030. PPL will receive a variable rate interest payment based on
either a 3-month or 6-month LIBOR rate through the maturity dates of these
agreements. The estimated fair value of the forward interest rate swaps, which
represents the estimated amount PPL would receive if it had terminated these
agreements at December 31, 1999, was $325 million. In the fourth quarter, PPL
Electric Utilities also entered into $171 million notional amount of interest
rate swaps whereby the company agreed to pay a floating interest rate and
receive a fixed interest rate payment. These swaps were executed with the intent
of adjusting the amount of floating-rate debt carried in its liability
portfolio. At December 31, 1999 the estimated fair value of these contracts,
representing the amount PPL Electric Utilities would pay if it terminated these
agreements at December 31, 1999 was $49 million.
During the fourth quarter of 1999, PPL also executed forward currency
agreements with various counterparties to hedge a portion of its currency risk
associated with its net investment in a foreign subsidiary. These agreements
were settled in December 1999 with a realized gain of $19 million. This gain
was recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. At December 31, 1999 there were no forward currency agreements
outstanding.
The carrying amount on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the estimated
fair value of PPL financial instruments are as follows millions of dollars                     December 31, 1999 December 31, 1998

11. Credit Arrangements & Financing Activities
PPL Electric Utilities issues commercial paper and, from time to time,
borrows from banks to provide short-term funds for general corporate purposes.
Bank borrowings generally bear interest at rates negotiated at the time of the
borrowing. At December 31, 1999, PPL Electric Utilities had $183 million of
commercial paper outstanding.
PPL Capital Funding, whose purpose is to provide debt funding for PPL and
its subsidiaries other than PPL Electric Utilities, also issues commercial
paper. As with all PPL Capital Funding debt, this commercial paper is guaranteed
by PPL. At December 31, 1999, PPL Capital Funding had $298 million of commercial
paper outstanding.
In July 1999, PPL Electric Utilities, PPL Capital Funding and PPL as
guarantor for PPL Capital Funding entered into a new 364-day $750 million
credit facility with a group of banks. This facility replaced a $350 million
364-day revolving credit facility shared by PPL Electric Utilities and PPL
Capital Funding and five separate $80 million 364-day credit facilities
maintained by PPL Capital Funding. No borrowings are outstanding under this new
facility.
In June 1999, PPL Electric Utilities instituted a short-term bond program
in order to meet short-term working capital requirements and to increase
financing flexibility. Under this program, a total of $600 million of short-term
bonds were issued, with no more than $200 million of such bonds outstanding at
any one time. This program was completed in August 1999, and no such bonds were
outstanding at December 31, 1999.
In August 1999, PPL purchased 14 million shares of common stock for $417
million, under forward purchase agreements with third parties. Also in August
1999, PPL Electric Utilities repurchased and subsequently retired $1467 billion
of first mortgage bonds through tender offers and open market purchases. See
Note 5 for additional information on the issuance of $242 billion of transition
bonds to securitize stranded costs, some of the proceeds of which were used to
fund this purchase of common stock and tendered debt.   In January 1999, PPL and PPL Capital Funding filed a $400 million shelf
registration with the SEC for the registration of debt securities. In October
1999, PPL Capital Funding used this shelf registration to issue $200 million of
medium-term notes in the form of 770% Reset Put Securities Series due 2007. In
connection with this issuance, PPL Capital Funding assigned to a third party the
option to call the notes from the holders on November 15, 2002. These notes will
mature on November 15, 2007, but will be required to be surrendered by the
existing holders on November 15, 2002 either through the exercise of the call
option or, if such option is not exercised, through the automatic exercise of a
mandatory put. If the call option is exercised, the notes will be remarketed and
the interest rate will be reset for the remainder of their term to the maturity
date. If the call option is not exercised, the mandatory put will be exercised
and PPL Capital Funding will be required to repurchase the notes at 100% of
their principal amount on November 15, 2002.
PPL, PPL Capital Funding and PP Capital Funding Trust I filed a $12
billion shelf registration with the SEC in September 1999 for the registration
of debt and equity securities. It is expected that such securities will be
issued from time to time to provide funding for general corporate purposes,
including making loans to the unregulated subsidiaries of PPL and reducing
commercial paper balances.
In November 1999, PPL Montana entered into $950 million of credit
facilities, non-recourse to PPL, with a group of banks, including a $675 million
364-day facility and two revolving credit facilities totaling $275 million which
mature in 2002. The purpose of these facilities is to provide bridge loan
financing for the acquisition of the Montana assets and to fund PPL Montana
working capital needs. At December 31, 1999, $370 million of borrowings were
outstanding under these facilities.
In December 1999, Emel repaid $145 million of outstanding bank loans with
proceeds from a borrowing from CEP Reserves, Inc., a PPL Electric Utilities
indirect subsidiary. A $145 million demand note was established for the
repayment of funds from Emel to CEP Reserves. Emel will pay a market-based rate
of interest on the outstanding loan.
12. Acquisitions and Divestitures
In August 1998 PPL acquired PPL Gas Utilities. The transaction was treated
as a purchase for accounting and financial reporting purposes. PPL issued
approximately 56 million shares of common stock with a value of approximately
$135 million, to acquire all PPL Gas Utilities' common and preferred stock.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, shareowners of PPL Gas Utilities
received 6968 common shares of PPL for each common share of PPL Gas Utilities
that they owned and 0682 common shares of PPL for each preferred share of PPL
Gas Utilities that they owned.
In February 1999, PPL acquired McCarl; in April 1999, PPL Spectrum
acquired Burns Mechanical; and in September 1999, PPL acquired Western Mass.
Holdings. In October 1999, Burns Mechanical merged with DVY. The purchase prices
for these mechanical contractor and engineering firms were not individually significant. In 1998 PPL had
acquired H.T. Lyons and McClure.
In May 1999, PPL Global acquired most of Bangor Hydro generating assets
and certain transmission rights, as well as its interest in an oil-fired
generation facility, for $79 million. In August 1999, PPL Global purchased
Bangor Hydro 50% interest in the 20-megawatt West Enfield hydroelectric
station for $10 million.
In July 1999, PPL Global acquired an additional 294% interest in Emel for
$95 million, resulting in majority ownership and control of the company. In
August 1999, PPL Global acquired an additional 185% interest in Emel for $44
million. During October and November 1999, PPL Global acquired another 10%
interest in Emel for $23 million and acquired interests in four of Emel
subsidiaries at a cost of $48 million. As a result of these acquisitions, PPL
Global ownership of Emel increased to 954%. Acquisition of the controlling
interest in Emel in July 1999 also gave PPL Global a majority interest in EC, a
holding company jointly owned by PPL Global and Emel. As a result, PPL Global
consolidated the financial statements of Emel and EC effective January 1, 1999.
In July 1999, PPL Global reached an agreement with Duke Energy North
America to jointly complete the Griffith Energy Project, a gas-fired, combined-
cycle power plant near Kingman, Arizona. As part of the agreement, PPL Global
transferred a 50% interest in the project to Duke. PPL Global will fund 50% of
the capital cost of the project. The facility, expected to be in service in
2001, will have a nominal base-load capacity of 500 megawatts and a peak
capacity of 600 megawatts. The project cost is anticipated to be about $300
million.
In September 1999, PPL Global U.K. subsidiary, SWEB, sold its electricity
supply business to London Electricity for about $264 million. PPL Global
recorded an after tax gain from the sale of $64 million. The supply business
provided about 15% of SWEB annual earnings. PPL Global and Southern Energy
will continue joint ownership of the electric delivery business, which has been
renamed Western Power Distribution WPD. WPD will continue to own and operate
an extensive power network in southwest Britain, transporting and delivering
electricity to 14 million customers.
In November 1999, PPL Electric Utilities sold its Sunbury plant and the
principal assets of its wholly-owned coal processing subsidiary, Lady Jane
Collieries, to Sunbury Holdings, LLC. PPL Electric Utilities received cash
proceeds of $107 million for these assets, which resulted in an after tax gain
of about $42 million.
In 1998, PPL Global signed definitive agreements with the Montana Power
Company Montana Power, Portland General Electric Company Portland and
Puget Sound Energy, Inc. Puget to acquire interests in 13 Montana power
plants, with 2,372 gross megawatts of generating capacity, for a purchase price
of $1546 billion. The acquisition involves the Colstrip and Corette coal-fired
plants, 11 hydroelectric facilities and a storage reservoir. The Puget and
Portland agreements also provide for the acquisition of related transmission
assets for an additional $126 million, subject to certain conditions.
In December 1999, PPL Global completed the purchase of about 1,315 gross
megawatts of generating assets from Montana Power for $757 million. PPL Montana
used $365 million of credit facilities, and PPL contributed approximately $392
million of project equity funds, through the issuance of PPL Capital Funding
commercial paper and the redemption of investments, to acquire these assets.
PPL Montana applied purchase accounting to record the transaction, and the
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair
value. The excess of the purchase price over the recorded assets and
liabilities was about $71 million at December 31, 1999, and was allocated as
goodwill. This acquisition transferred to PPL Montana the 11 hydroelectric
facilities, the storage reservoir, the Corette plant and Montana Power
ownership interest in three of the four units of the Colstrip plant, along with
other generation-related assets. PPL Montana is now operating these facilities.
PPL Montana also acquired the energy marketing and trading operation of Montana
Power for an amount that was not significant. The Montana marketing and trading
operation, which is now part of PPL EnergyPlus, is selling electricity in
wholesale and retail markets in Montana and the Northwest.
PPL Global acquisition of the Colstrip interests of Portland and Puget,
totaling 1,057 additional megawatts, is subject to several conditions, primarily
the receipt of satisfactory regulatory approvals from the state utility
commissions in Oregon and Washington. The Washington Utilities and
Transportation Commission issued a decision in September 1999 with respect to
Puget 735-megawatt interest in Colstrip, which Puget is disputing in the state
appellate court. On February 29, 2000, the Oregon Public Utility Commission
denied Portland application to sell its 322-megawatt interest in Colstrip, but
stated that it would be willing to reconsider the decision if Portland could
demonstrate sufficient additional benefits to Oregon ratepayers as a result of
the sale. The interested parties are reviewing the regulatory decisions and
evaluating possible actions to address the decisions. The acquisition agreements
permit each party to terminate the respective agreements if closing does not
occur by April 30, 2000. PPL cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings,
whether the outcome will be satisfactory to the parties, or the effect of these
proceedings on the timing or the ability to complete these acquisitions.   In December 1999, the U.K. Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, the
regulatory authority for electricity and natural gas distribution, announced the
final price review for the electric distribution companies, including WPD. In
this final price review, WPD was given a one-time rate cut of 19%, the lowest
rate among distribution companies in the U.K. The price cut will be effective
for five years starting in April 2000. As a result of this action, PPL Global
evaluated the carrying value of its investment in WPD and the investment was
written down by $36 million. In unrelated transactions, PPL Global wrote down
the carrying value of two other international investments by a total of $16
million.
13. Stock-Based Compensation
Under the PPL Incentive Compensation Plan ICP and the Incentive
Compensation Plan for Key Employees ICPKE together, the Plans,
restricted shares of common stock as well as stock options may be granted to
officers and other key employees of PPL, PPL Electric Utilities and other
affiliated companies. Awards under the Plans are made in the common stock of
PPL by the Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of
Directors in the case of the ICP, and by the PPL Corporate Leadership Council in
the case of the ICPKE. Each Plan limits the number of shares available for
awards to two percent of the outstanding common stock of PPL on the first day of
each calendar year. The maximum number of options which can be awarded under
each Plan to any single eligible employee in any calendar year is 15 million
shares. Any portion of these shares that has not been granted may be carried
over and used in any subsequent year. If any award lapses or is forfeited or the
rights to the participant terminate, any shares of common stock are again
available for grant. Shares delivered under the Plans may be in the form of
authorized and unissued common stock, common stock held in treasury by PPL or
common stock purchased on the open market including private purchases in
accordance with applicable securities laws.
Restricted Stock
-    Restricted shares of common stock are outstanding shares with full voting
and dividend rights. However, the shares are subject to forfeiture or
accelerated payout under Plan provisions for termination, retirement, disability and death. Restricted shares vest fully if
control of PPL changes, as defined by the Plans.
Restricted stock awards of 108,890, 107,198 and 39,011 shares, with per
share weighted-average fair values of $2674, $2274, and $2339, were granted
in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Compensation expense for these three years
was less than $2 million annually. At December 31, 1999, there were 224,903
restricted shares outstanding. These awards currently vest three years from the
date of grant.
Stock Options
-    Under the Plans, stock options may also be granted with an option exercise
price per share not less than the fair market value of PPL common stock on the
date of grant. The options are exercisable beginning one year after the date of
grant, assuming the individual is still employed by PPL or a subsidiary, in
installments as determined by the Compensation and Corporate Governance
Committee of the Board of Directors in the case of the ICP, and the Corporate
Leadership Council in the case of the ICPKE. The Committee or the Corporate
Leadership Council, in the case of the ICPKE has discretion to accelerate the
exercisability of the options. All options expire ten years from the grant date.
The options become exercisable if control of PPL changes, as defined by the
Plans.
At December 31, 1999, there were 626,020 stock options outstanding, with a
fair value of $237 per option. Fair value was determined using a modified
Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions: Risk-free interest rate -
561%; Expected stock volatility - 1619%; Expected dividend yield rate - 660 and Expected Option life years - 10.
PPL applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25 Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees and related interpretations in accounting for stock
options. Since stock options are granted at market price, no compensation cost
has been recognized. Compensation calculated in accordance with the disclosure
requirements of FASB 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, was not
significant and had no impact on earnings per share. See Note 1.
In April 1999, PPL made its initial award of stock options under the Plan.
A summary of the stock option activity for 1999 follows                  Shares  Weighted Average Price

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
PPL and its subsidiaries sponsor various pension and other postretirement
and postemployment benefit plans.
PPL Electric Utilities, PPL Montana, Penobscot Hydro, and PPL Gas Utilities
have funded, noncontributory defined benefit plans covering substantially all
employees. PPL and its subsidiaries also provide supplemental retirement
benefits to directors, executives, and other key management employees through
nonqualified retirement plans.
Substantially all employees of PPL subsidiaries will become eligible for
certain health care and life insurance benefits upon retirement through
contributory plans. The employees of North Penn Gas, a subsidiary of PPL Gas
Utilities, are eligible for certain health care and life insurance benefits upon
retirement through a noncontributory plan. Benefits for the PPL Electric
Utilities and North Penn Gas postretirement benefits are paid from funded VEBA
trusts sponsored by each company. PPL Electric Utilities and North Penn Gas made
contributions to the VEBA trusts of $29 million and $1 million, respectively,
during 1999. At December 31, 1999, PPL Electric Utilities had a regulatory asset
of $7 million relating to postretirement benefits that is being amortized and
recovered in rates with a remaining life of 13 years.

The net periodic pension cost charged to operating expenses was $9 million
in 1999, $2 million in 1998 and $5 million in 1997. Retiree health and benefits
costs charged to operating expenses were approximately $20 million in 1999, $19
million in 1998 and $23 million in 1997. Costs in excess of the amounts charged
to expense were charged to construction and other accounts.   Postretirement medical costs at December 31, 1999 were based on the
assumption that costs would increase 75% in 1999, then the rate of increase
would decline gradually to 6% in 2006 and thereafter. A one-percentage point

value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in
excess of plan assets were in millions $41, $34 and $6 respectively, as of
December 31, 1999, and $40, $34 and $6 respectively, as of December 31, 1998.
PPL Electric Utilities and its subsidiaries formerly engaged in coal mining
accrued an additional liability for the cost of health care of their retired
miners. At December 31, 1999, the liability was $19 million. The liability is
net of $50 million of estimated future benefit payments offset by $31 million of
available assets in PPL Electric Utilities funded VEBA trusts.
Savings Plans
Substantially all employees of PPL subsidiaries are eligible to
participate in deferred savings plans 401k. Company contributions to the
plans approximated $6 million in 1999, $4 million in 1998, and $2 million in
1997. Increasing contributions were the result of company acquisitions and a
1999 enhanced matching formula for the PPL Electric Utilities plans.
Postemployment Benefits
PPL Electric Utilities provides health and life insurance benefits to
disabled employees and income benefits to eligible spouses of deceased
employees. Postemployment benefits charged to operating expenses were not
significant in 1999, 1998 or 1997. 15. Jointly Owned Facilities

operating costs associated with the stations is reflected on the Consolidated
Statement of Income.
16. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
Construction Expenditures
PPL Electric Utilities' construction expenditures for the period 2000-2004
are estimated to aggregate $17 billion, including AFUDC and capitalized
interest. For discussion pertaining to construction expenditures, see Review of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption Financial
Condition - Capital Expenditure Requirements.
Nuclear Insurance
PPL Electric Utilities is a member of certain insurance programs which
provide coverage for property damage to members' nuclear generating stations.
Facilities at the Susquehanna station are insured against property damage losses
up to $275 billion under these programs. PPL Electric Utilities is also a
member of an insurance program which provides insurance coverage for the cost of
replacement power during prolonged outages of nuclear units caused by certain
specified conditions. Under the property and replacement power insurance
programs, PPL Electric Utilities could be assessed retroactive premiums in the
event of the insurers' adverse loss experience. At December 31, 1999, the
maximum amount PPL Electric Utilities could be assessed under these programs was about $24 million.
PPL Electric Utilities' public liability for claims resulting from a
nuclear incident at the Susquehanna station is limited to about $97 billion
under provisions of The Price Anderson Amendments Act of 1988. PPL Electric
Utilities is protected against this liability by a combination of commercial
insurance and an industry assessment program. In the event of a nuclear incident
at any of the reactors covered by The Price Anderson Amendments Act of 1988, PPL
Electric Utilities could be assessed up to $168 million per incident, payable at
a rate of $20 million per year, plus an additional 5% surcharge, if applicable.
Environmental Matters
Air
The Clean Air Act deals, in part, with acid rain, attainment of federal
ambient ozone standards and toxic air emissions. PPL subsidiaries are in
compliance with the 1995 Phase I acid rain provisions and have taken steps to
comply with the year 2000 Phase II acid rain provisions.
PPL Electric Utilities has met the 1995 ambient ozone requirements of the
Clean Air Act by reducing its rate of NOx emissions by nearly 50% through the
use of low NOx burners. During 1999, further seasonal May-June NOx reductions
to 55% from 1990 levels were achieved in response to PA DEP rule implementing
the Northeast Ozone Transport Region Memorandum of Understanding OTR MOU.
These reductions were achieved with operational initiatives that rely, to a
large extent, on the low NOx burners.
The PA DEP has proposed further seasonal May-June NOx reductions to 80%
from 1990 levels starting in 2003. These further reductions are based on the
requirements of the OTR MOU and two EPA ambient ozone initiatives: the
September, 1998, EPA SIP-call issued under Section 110 of the Clean Air Act,
requiring reductions from 22 eastern states, including Pennsylvania; and the
Northeastern states, requiring reductions from sources in 12 northeastern states
and D.C., including PPL Electric Utilities' sources. Despite various court
challenges to the EPA initiatives, the PA DEP is expected to move forward with
the 2003 NOx reductions based on the OTR MOU. PPL Electric Utilities estimates
that the 2003 NOx reductions will be achieved with the installation of SCR
selective catalytic reduction technology on PPL Electric Utilities' three
largest units.
EPA has also developed new standards for ambient levels of fine
particulates. These standards were challenged and remanded to EPA by the D.C.
Circuit Court in 1999. The new particulates standard, if finalized, may require
further reductions in SO2 for certain PPL subsidiaries and may expand the
planned seasonal NOx reductions at PPL Electric Utilities to year-round
commencing in 2010-2012.
Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA has been studying the health effects of
hazardous air emissions from power plants and other sources, in order to
determine what should be regulated. The EPA has concluded that mercury is the power plant air toxin of greatest concern, but
that more evaluation is needed before it can determine whether it must be
regulated. The EPA is now seeking mercury and chlorine sampling and other data
from electric generating units, including those operated by PPL Electric
Utilities and PPL Montana.
The EPA recently initiated enforcement actions against eight utilities,
asserting that older, coal-fired power plants operated by those utilities have,
over the years, been modified in ways that subject them to more stringent New
Source requirements under the Clean Air Act. The EPA also has threatened
similar enforcement action with respect to plants operated by other, unnamed
utilities, as well as facilities in other industries. PPL and PPL Electric
Utilities at this time are unable to predict whether such EPA enforcement
actions will be brought with respect to any PPL Electric Utilities or PPL
Montana plants and the scope, outcome or ultimate financial impact of any
potential EPA actions. Compliance with any such EPA enforcement actions could
result in additional capital and operating expenses in amounts which are not now
determinable but which could be significant.
The EPA is also proposing to revise its regulations in a way that will
require power plants to meet new source performance standards and/or undergo new
source review for many maintenance and repair activities that are currently
exempted as routine.
Expenditures to meet the 2000 acid rain and 2003 NOx reduction requirements
are included in the table of projected construction expenditures in the section
entitled Financial Condition - Capital Expenditure Requirements in the Review
of the Financial Condition and Results of Operations. PPL currently estimates
that additional capital expenditures and operating costs for environmental
compliance under the Clean Air Act will be incurred beyond 2002 in amounts which
are not now determinable, but which could be significant.
Water and Residual Waste
The final NPDES permit for PPL Electric Utilities' Montour plant contains
stringent limits for iron and chlorine discharges. Depending on the results of a
toxic reduction study, additional water treatment facilities or operational
changes may be needed at this plant.
Capital expenditures through the year 2003 to correct groundwater
degradation at fossil-fueled generating stations, and to address waste water
control at PPL Electric Utilities' facilities are included in the table of
construction expenditures in the section entitled Financial Condition - Capital
Expenditure Requirements in the Review of the Financial Condition and Results
of Operations. In this regard, PPL Electric Utilities currently estimates that
about $6 million of additional capital expenditures may be required in the next
four years to close some of the ash basins and address other ash basin issues at
various generating plants. Additional capital expenditures could be required
beyond the year 2003 in amounts which are not now determinable but which could
be material. Actions taken to correct groundwater degradation, to comply with the DEP regulations and to address
waste water control, are also expected to result in increased operating costs in
amounts which are not now determinable but which could be material.
Superfund and Other Remediation
In 1995, PPL Electric Utilities entered into a consent order with the DEP
to address a number of sites where PPL Electric Utilities may be liable for
remediation or contamination. This may include potential PCB contamination at
certain PPL Electric Utilities substations and pole sites; potential
contamination at a number of coal gas manufacturing facilities formerly owned
and operated by PPL Electric Utilities; and oil or other contamination which may
exist at some of PPL Electric Utilities' former generating facilities. As of
December 31, 1999, PPL Electric Utilities has completed work on approximately
two-thirds of the sites included in the consent order.
In 1996, PPL Gas Utilities entered into a similar consent order with the
DEP to address a number of its sites where PPL Gas Utilities may be liable for
remediation of contamination. The sites primarily include former coal gas
manufacturing facilities. Prior to PPL acquiring PPL Gas Utilities in August of
1998 PPL Gas Utilities had obtained a no further action determination from the
DEP for two of the 20 sites covered by the order.
At December 31, 1999, PPL Electric Utilities and PPL Gas Utilities had
accrued approximately $6 million and $16 million, respectively, representing the
amounts they can reasonably estimate they will have to spend for site
remediation, including those sites covered by each company consent orders
mentioned above.
In October 1999, the Montana Supreme Court held in favor of several
citizens' groups that the right to a clean and healthful environment is a
fundamental right guaranteed by the Montana Constitution. The Court ruling
could result in significantly more stringent environmental laws and regulations
as well as an increase in citizens' suits under Montana environmental laws.
The effect on PPL Montana of any such changes in laws or regulations or any such
increase in citizen suits is not currently determinable but could be
significant.
Future cleanup or remediation work at sites currently under review, or at
sites not currently identified, may result in material additional operating
costs for PPL subsidiaries that cannot be estimated at this time. PPL Montana
has been indemnified by the Montana Power Company for any preacquisition
environmental liability. However, this indemnification is conditioned on certain
circumstances that can result in PPL Montana and the Montana Power Company
sharing in certain costs within limits set forth in the Asset Purchase
Agreement.
General
Due to the environmental issues discussed above or other environmental
matters, PPL Electric Utilities may be required to modify, replace or cease
operating certain facilities to comply with statutes, regulations and actions by regulatory bodies or courts. In this
regard, PPL Electric Utilities also may incur capital expenditures, operating
expenses and other costs in amounts which are not now determinable but which
could be material.
Loan Guarantees of Affiliated Companies
PPL provides certain guarantees for its subsidiaries. Specifically, PPL
guarantees all of the debt of PPL Capital Funding. As of December 31, 1999, PPL
guaranteed $597 million of medium-term notes and $298 million of commercial
paper issued by PPL Capital Funding. At December 31, 1998 PPL had guaranteed
$397 million of PPL Capital Funding medium-term notes, and $552 million of its
commercial paper. PPL also provided loan guarantees to PPL Global subsidiaries,
totaling $118 million in 1999 and $13 million in 1998. Also, PPL guaranteed
notes of a subsidiary of PPL Gas Utilities, amounting to $18 million and $19
million at the end of 1999 and 1998, respectively. Additionally, PPL has
guaranteed certain obligations of PPL EnergyPlus for up to $271 million under
power purchase and sales agreements. These guarantees amounted to $31 million in
1998.
At December 31, 1999 and 1998, PPL Electric Utilities provided a guarantee
in the amount of $12 million in support of one of its subsidiaries.
Source of Labor Supply
As of December 31, 1999, PPL and its subsidiaries had 9,166 employees,
including 6,314 full-time PPL Electric Utilities employees and 470 full-time PPL
Montana employees. Approximately 62 percent of PPL Electric Utilities' full-time
employees are represented by the IBEW. Approximately 68 percent of PPL Montana
employees are represented by the IBEW. PPL Electric Utilities reached a new
labor agreement with the IBEW in 1998. This agreement expires in May 2002. PPL
Montana contract with the IBEW expires in 2001.
17. New Accounting Standards
In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS 137 which defers the effective date of
SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. PPL and PPL Electric Utilities
intend to adopt SFAS 133 as of January 1, 2001. The impact of adopting this
statement on the net income and financial position of PPL and PPL Electric
Utilities is not expected to be material.
18. Subsequent Events
In February 2000, PPL Capital Funding issued $500 million of medium-term
notes in the form of 775% series due 2005. This issuance used $500 million of
the $12 billion SEC shelf registration filed in September 1999. At the time of
issuance, PPL also settled a number of forward-starting swaps that had been
entered into in a lower interest rate environment as a means to lock-in interest
rates and limit exposure to increasing interest rates, all pursuant to PPL
Interest Rate Risk Management Program. The Company received net proceeds of
$158 million from the settlement of these contracts, which will be deferred on the balance sheet and subsequently amortized over the life of the
