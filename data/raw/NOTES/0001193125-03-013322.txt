23  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS  The Board of Directors and Shareholders Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 28, 2003 and March 29,
2002, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 28, 2003. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at
d. These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc. at March 28, 2003 and March 29, 2002 and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 28, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects the information set forth therein.  As discussed in Note 1, Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc. changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other
intangible assets effective March 31, 2001.  /S/ERNST YOUNG LLP  Los Angeles, California June 4, 2003

28  KEYSTONE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  March 28, 2003  1.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Principles of Consolidation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc. Keystone and its wholly
owned subsidiaries. Significant subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements include Keystone Automotive Industries MN, Inc. formerly North Star Plating Co., Keystone Automotive Industries FL, Inc. formerly Inteuro Parts
Distributors, Inc. and Keystone Automotive Industries Resources, Inc. formerly Republic Automotive Parts, Inc. collectively with Keystone, the Company. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Business Information  The Company operates in one business segment. The principal business of the
Company is the distribution of collision replacement parts for automobiles and light trucks to collision repair shops through a network of distribution centers located within the United States, one in Mexico, and one in Canada.  The Companys product offerings, comprised of more than 19,000 stock
keeping units, may be divided into four primary categories: i the Companys core business continues to be automotive body parts which consist primarily of fenders, hoods, headlight and taillight assemblies, radiators, condensers and grilles,
ii the Company distributes new and remanufactured plastic bumper covers and steel bumpers manufactured by multiple domestic and foreign manufacturers, iii the Company distributes paint and other materials used in repairing a damaged vehicle
primarily to repair shops and iv the Company distributes wheels and related products.  Fiscal Year  The
Company uses a 52/53 week fiscal year. The Companys fiscal year ends on the last Friday of March. The fiscal years ended March 28, 2003, March 29, 2002 and March 30, 2001 each included 52 weeks, respectively.  Accounting Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  Concentrations of Risk  Accounts receivable subject the Company to a potential concentration of credit risk. Substantially all of the Companys customers are in the auto
body repair business, none representing more than 1% of sales. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral. Receivables are generally due within 30 days.
Credit losses have consistently been within managements expectations.  During 2003 and 2002, the Company imported 20% and 18% of its products from the Far East, respectively. 
29  KEYSTONE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Fair Values of Financial Instruments  Fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
payable, credit facility and other short-term obligations approximate cost due to the short period of time to maturity.  Cash Equivalents  The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash
equivalents are held by major financial institutions.  Inventories  The Companys inventories
consist primarily of automotive aftermarket collision replacement parts, paint and related items. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market.  Long-Lived Assets  The Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The estimated future cash flows are based upon, among other things,
assumptions about expected future operating performance, and may differ from actual cash flows. Long-lived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of
the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets, the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the
period in which the determination is made. The Company has determined that no impairment of long-lived assets exists as of December 31, 2002.  During fiscal 2001, the Company recognized approximately $71 million of nonrecurring expenses. These expenses were primarily the result of a write-down
of certain computer related expenses $47 million and the Companys investment in an Internet business-to-business service provider $10 million and the recording of a reserve for idle leased facilities relating to the closing or
consolidation of three locations $15 million. In addition, the Company recorded a reserve of $150,000 relating to the estimated environmental clean-up costs in connection with the closing of a plating facility in fiscal 2001.  Depreciation and Amortization  The Company uses the straight-line method for calculating depreciation and
amortization of property, plant, and equipment over the following estimated useful lives:  Buildings
20 years
Machinery and equipment
512 years
Furniture and fixtures
57 years
Auto and truck
35 years
Leasehold improvements
Term of lease or life of the asset, whichever is shorter
Goodwill and Other
Intangibles  In July 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141 supersedes Accounting Principle Board Opinion APB No. 16 Business Combinations and SFAS No. 38 Accounting for Preacquisition
Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises. 
30  KEYSTONE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
SFAS No. 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method. The Company implemented SFAS No.
141 on March 31, 2001. This statement did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.  The Company elected to early adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which supersedes AFB No. 17. SFAS No.
142 applies to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001, as well as goodwill and intangible assets previously acquired. Under this statement, goodwill as well as certain other intangible assets, determined to have an infinite
life, will no longer be amortized. These assets will be reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis. The Company early adopted SFAS No. 142 effective March 31, 2001. Consequently, all goodwill on the Companys balance sheet from that date
forward will no longer be subject to amortization. Other intangibles, consisting of covenants not to compete with finite lives, will continue to be amortized over the term of the respective covenant. Pursuant to SFAS No. 142, the Company performed a
transitional assessment of impairment of goodwill and other intangibles by applying a fair-value-based test and determined that the Companys goodwill was impaired.  Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, goodwill, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of
the net assets of acquired entities, is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment review as provided in SFAS No. 142. Other intangibles are comprised of covenants not to compete. Covenants not to compete are amortized using the
straight-line method over the terms of the agreements, generally 35 years.  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue upon concluding that all of the fundamental criteria for product revenue recognition have been met. Such criteria are usually met at the time title passes to the customer, typically at the time of delivery or
shipment. The costs related to shipping and handling fees are included in selling and distribution expenses. The Company provides its customers the right to return products that are damaged or defective. The effect of these programs is estimated and
current period sales and costs of sales are reduced accordingly.  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company elected
to continue to account for stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value-based method of accounting prescribed by APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. Under the provisions of APB
No. 25, compensation expense is measured at the grant date for the difference between the fair value of the stock and the exercise price. The Company has not granted stock options at less than the fair value of the stock at the date of grant.
New Accounting Standards  In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement
133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under
SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The Company does not expect
the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on its operating results or financial position.  In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which addresses issues regarding
the recognition, measurement and reporting of costs associated 
31  KEYSTONE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
with exit and disposal activities, including restructuring activities. This statement requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities be
recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The implementation of this Standard did not have a material effect on the Company.  In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types
of guarantees. For certain guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior
to January 1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements. The Company does not believe that the adoption of this Interpretation will have a material impact on its consolidated financial
position or statement of operations.  In January 2003, FASB
issued Interpretation No. 46 FIN 46, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. Under FIN 46, which requires the Company to consolidate variable interest entities for which it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and disclose
information about variable interest entities in which it has a significant variable interest. FIN 46 became effective immediately for variable interest entities formed after January 31, 2003 and will become effective in the third quarter of 2003 for
any variable interest entities formed prior to February 1, 2003. The Company does not believe that this Interpretation will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  2.ACQUISITIONS  During fiscal 2003, the Company acquired certain assets of the following
businesses: Perfect Cooling Industries, Inc., a distributor of aftermarket radiators and condensers with operations in Carson, California, Chicago, Illinois, Norcross, Georgia and Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania in April 2002; Arizona Plating, a
bumper recycling facility in Phoenix, Arizona in April 2002; and Advance Plating, a distributor of aftermarket collision replacement parts in Republic, Missouri in January 2003. The Company acquired these three companies for approximately $67
million in cash, net of cash received. All of these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired entities have been recorded at their estimated fair value at the
dates of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired was approximately $09 million and has been recorded as goodwill. The consolidated financial statements include the results of operations for
each business for all periods subsequent to the applicable purchase date. The results for fiscal 2003 and 2002, assuming that these acquisitions had been made at the beginning of fiscal 2002, would not have been materially different from the results
presented.  During fiscal 2002, the Company acquired certain
assets of the following businesses: After Crash, Inc., a distributor of aftermarket collision replacement parts in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in July 2001; I.W.C. International, Inc., a distributor of aftermarket wheel covers and center caps for
automobiles and light trucks, with operations in Tampa, Florida, Hanover, Massachusetts, Haltom City, Texas, Hayward, California and Quincy, Illinois in January 2002; and Indiana Distributors incorporated, a distributor of aftermarket collision
replacement parts in Elkhart, Indiana in January 2002. In addition, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of P-G Products, Inc., a distributor of aftermarket collision replacement parts in Cincinnati, Ohio in January 2002. The
Company acquired these four companies for approximately $68 million cash, net of cash received. All of these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired
entities have been recorded at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired was approximately 
32  KEYSTONE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
$18 million and has been recorded as goodwill. The consolidated financial statements include the results of operations for each business for all periods
subsequent to the applicable purchase date. The results for fiscal 2002 and 2001, assuming that these acquisitions had been made at the beginning of fiscal 2001, would not be materially different from the results presented.  3.GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES  Amortization expense for other intangibles for the years ended March 28,
2003, March 29, 2002 and March30, 2001 was $483,000, $484,000 and $496,000.  The carrying amount of goodwill as of March 28, 2003 and March 29, 2002, was $30 million and $18million, respectively. Amortization expense for goodwill amounted to $18 million for the year ended
March30, 2001.  The pro forma effect on fiscal 2001
earnings of excluding goodwill amortization expense, net of tax, is as follows in thousands, except per share amounts:  March30,2001 Reported net loss 477 Add back goodwill amortization, net of tax 884 Pro forma net income 407 Basic and diluted loss earnings per share Reported net loss earnings per share 03 Add back goodwill amortization 06 Pro forma earnings per share, basic and diluted 03  4.FINANCING
ARRANGEMENTS  The Company maintains a revolving line of
credit with a commercial lender that provides a $35,000,000 secured credit facility and the balance is due on June 1, 2005. Initial advances under the revolving line of credit are made with interest at the lenders prime rate 425% at March
28, 2003. The Company has converted a portion of the advances to LIBOR plus 100% 23% at March 28, 2003. At March 28, 2003, $166 million was outstanding under the line of credit. In December 2002, the Company caused the commercial lender to
issue a letter of credit in the amount of $20 million to secure certain obligations to its primary insurer, which reduces the amount available under the credit facility. The availability under the line of credit at March 28, 2003 was $164 million.
The loan agreement is subject to certain restrictive covenants and requires that the Company maintain certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of March 28, 2003.  5.SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY  The Company maintains a stock repurchase plan as authorized by the Board of
Directors, which at March28, 2003, authorized the purchase of up to $41 million of its common stock at such times and at such prices as the President and Chief Financial Officer deemed appropriate. Repurchased shares were redeemed and treated
as authorized but unissued shares. Since the inception of the plan, the Company has repurchased approximately 35 million shares for approximately $458 million, an average of $1301 per share. During the year ended March 30, 2001, the Company had
repurchased approximately 533,000 shares of its common stock at an average cost of $607 per share. No shares were repurchased during fiscal 2003 or fiscal 2002. 
33  KEYSTONE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
In February 2000, the Company issued 100,000 warrants to purchase the Companys stock at an
exercise price of $650 to a vendor. The warrants are exercisable starting in February 2001 through 2005, or through the date of dissolution of the agreement. Using the intrinsic value method, the Company recorded the warrants in equity at $236,000
and amortized the expense over the period services were received from the vendor. The warrants were fully amortized in fiscal 2002.  The Company may pay dividends at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company has never paid dividends.  6.EARNINGS PER SHARE  The Company calculates basic and diluted earnings per share as required by
SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants and convertible securities. Diluted earnings per share is calculated including the dilutive effects of warrants, options, and
convertible securities, if any. The income from continuing operations is used as the numerator to determine whether potential common shares are dilutive or antidilutive. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings
per share:  Year ended March28,2003

with an exercise price greater than the average market price of common stock were outstanding at March 30, 2001. These warrants, along with the employees stock options, were excluded from the fiscal 2001 computation of diluted earnings per share
because their effect would be antidilutive.  7.RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  The Company has entered into various property lease agreements with related parties, including certain of the Companys directors and officers and agreements with a corporation which is owned by a family member of a Company officer and
director. The leases contain terms up to 10 years. The Company believes that the terms and conditions of such leases with affiliated parties are no less favorable than could have been obtained from unaffiliated parties in arms length
transactions at the time such leases were entered into. Rent expense for related 
34  KEYSTONE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
party lease agreements, included in the total rent expense, amounted to $956,000, $956,000 and $918,000 for the fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001
respectively, exclusive of the Companys obligation for property taxes and insurance.  8.SALES BY PRODUCT  Fiscal Year Ended March28,2003

income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The provision for income taxes reflects the taxes to be paid for the
period and the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and liabilities.

BENEFIT PLANS  In March 1979, the Company adopted a
defined benefit pension plan the Plan to provide pension benefits to all non-union employees. Plan benefits are based on an employees years of service and the compensation during the five years of employment which would yield the highest
average compensation. Effective in April 1997, the Company suspended the accrual of future benefits.  In June 1998, the Company acquired Republic, including its pension. Republics defined benefit plan covers substantially all employees. Benefits
under this plan generally are based upon the employees years of service and compensation preceding retirement. The Companys general funding policy is to contribute amounts deductible for federal income taxes. Effective June 30, 1999, the
accrual of future benefits under the Republic defined benefit plan was suspended. The defined benefit plans of the Company and Republic were merged on December 31, 1999.

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, at
March 28, 2003 the Company recorded a minimum pension liability representing the excess of the accumulated benefit obligation over the fair value of the plan assets. The balance of the liability of $1,969,000 was reported in accumulated
comprehensive income loss, net of applicable deferred income taxes of $766,000.  In determining the actuarial present value of projected benefit obligations at March 28, 2003 and March 29, 2002, a discount rate of 600% and 675%, respectively, was used. There are no future compensation increases
due to the suspension of benefit accruals. The expected long-term annual rate of return on assets was 8% for the year ended March 28, 2003 and March 29, 2002. 
The Company maintains a 401k plan, as amended, that covers substantially all of its employees. Employees who have completed more than one year of
service are eligible and may contribute from 1% to 15% of their base pay. The Company matches 50% of the first 6% of employee contributions. Employee contributions vest immediately, while employer contributions vest based on years of service.
Employer contributions to the plan were $1,374,000, $1,265,000 and $1,318,000 as of March 28, 2003, March 29, 2002 and March 30, 2001, respectively.  11.STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS  In 1996, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a Stock Incentive Plan the 1996 Plan.

The Company adopted
SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure, which amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, SFAS No. 148 which provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary
change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirement of SFAS No. 123 to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial
statements of the effects of stock-based compensation. If the Company had elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of the options granted at the grant rate as prescribed by SFAS No. 148, net income loss and earnings loss
per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts shown below:  March28,2003 March 29,2002 March30,2001 In thousands, except per shareamounts Pro forma Net income lossas reported 14,747 22,033 477 Less: Fair value stock-based compensation 780 687 1,233 Net income losspro forma 13,967 22,720 1,710 Net income loss per shareas reported Basic 101 152 003 Diluted 99 148 003 Net income loss per sharepro forma Basic 95 157 12 Diluted 93 153 12

13.NON-RECURRING EXPENSES  In fiscal 2002, the enterprise software provider informed the Company that
it was ceasing all development for the software package licensed by the Company. As a result, the Company determined that it could not proceed with the Company-wide installation and booked a pre-tax charge of $68 million to write-off the previously
capitalized software development costs. With this charge, the Company has written-off its investment in this software package.  During fiscal 2001, the Company recognized approximately $71 million of nonrecurring expenses, these expenses were primarily the result of a write-down
of certain computer related expenses of approximately $4,663,000 and the Companys investment in an Internet business-to-business service provider, accounted for, using the cost method of accounting, of approximately $981,000, and approximately
$1,460,000 of expenses relating to the closing or consolidation of various locations.
