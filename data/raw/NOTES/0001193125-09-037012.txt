ITEM8. FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA  COMPANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The financial statements and related information contained in this Annual Report have been prepared by and are the responsibility of our management.
Our financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and reflect judgments and estimates as to the expected effects of transactions and events currently being
reported. Our management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the financial statements and other financial information included in this Annual Report. To meet this responsibility, we maintain a system of internal control over
financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly executed and recorded. The system includes policies and procedures, internal audits and our officers reviews.  Our Audit Committee of our Board of Directors is composed solely of directors who are
independent under applicable SEC and New York Stock Exchange rules. Our Audit Committee meets periodically and, when appropriate, separately with representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm, our officers and the internal
auditors to monitor the activities of each.  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, was appointed by our Audit Committee to audit our financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting and their report follows. Our stockholders ratified the appointment of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP at the 2008 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting for the Company. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment,
including testing, using the criteria in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys system of internal control over financial reporting is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Based on its assessment, management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on
criteria in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, issued by the COSO. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included below.  /s/ William H. Swanson s/ David C. Wajsgras

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Raytheon Company:
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders equity, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Raytheon Company and its subsidiaries at December31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.  As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, in
2008, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for, and discloses, the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. Also as discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2008, the Company changed the manner in which
it accounts for obligations associated with certain life insurance agreements. As discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2007, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for, and discloses, uncertain tax
positions. As discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2006, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for, and discloses, pensions and other post-employment benefits.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts February25, 2009

66 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Consolidation and ClassificationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Raytheon Company and all wholly-owned and majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All intercompany
transactions have been eliminated. For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year. In addition, certain prior year
amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. As used in these notes, the terms we, us, our, Raytheon and the Company mean Raytheon Company and its
subsidiaries, unless the context indicates another meaning.  Use of
EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that
affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual
results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements.  Revenue RecognitionWe account for our contracts associated with the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex aerospace or electronic
equipment and related services, or those otherwise within the scope of Chapter 11 of Accounting Research Bulletin No43, Government Contracts ARB No43 or Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and
Certain Production-Type Contracts SOP 81-1, such as certain cost-plus service contracts, using the percentage-of-completion accounting method. Under this method, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the
long-term contract. We combine closely related contracts when all the applicable criteria under SOP 81-1 are met. Similarly, we may segment a project, which may consist of a single contract or a group of contracts, with varying rates of
profitability, only if all the applicable criteria under SOP 81-1 are met.  We
generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for all of our long-term contracts unless we believe another method more clearly measures progress towards completion of the contract. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of
progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred-to-date to the total estimated costs at completion of the contract. Revenues, including estimated earned fees or profits, are recorded as costs are incurred. Incentive and
award fees are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer, achievement of certain program milestones or achievement of certain cost targets. Incentive and award fees are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer or upon
achievement of certain program milestones or cost targets. Incentive and award fees, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating profit rates. Estimates of award fees are based on actual awards and anticipated
performance which may include the performance of subcontractor or partners depending upon the individual contract requirements. Incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are generally not
recognized until the event occurs. Such incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Our claims on contracts are recorded only if it is probable the claim will result in
additional contract revenue and the amounts can be reliably estimated.  Changes
in estimates of contract sales, costs of sales and profits are recognized using a cumulative catch-up, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods. A significant change in one or more of
these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in
the period the loss is determined.  To a much lesser extent, we enter into
contracts that are not associated with the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex aerospace or electronic equipment and related services, or not otherwise within the scope of ARB No43 or SOP 81-1. We account for those
contracts in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No104, Revenue Recognition, or other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature. 
67 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
Revenue under such contracts is generally recognized upon delivery or as the service is performed. Revenue on contracts to sell software is recognized in
accordance with the requirements of Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. Revenue from non-software license fees is recognized over the expected life of the continued involvement with the customer. Royalty revenue is recognized
when earned. Revenue generated from fixed price service contracts not associated with the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex aerospace or electronic equipment is recognized as services are rendered once persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists, our price is fixed or determinable, and we have determined collectability is reasonably assured.  We apply the separation guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables for contracts with multiple deliverables. Revenue
arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables should be divided into more than one unit of accounting. For contracts with more than one unit of accounting, we recognize revenue for each deliverable based on
the revenue recognition policies discussed above.  Research and Development
ExpensesExpenditures for Company-sponsored research and development projects and bid and proposal costs are expensed as incurred. Customer-sponsored research and development projects performed under contracts are accounted for as contract
costs as the work is performed. Bid and proposal costs were between 40% and 50% of total Research and development expenses in 2008, 2007 and 2006.  Federal, Foreign and State Income TaxesThe Company and our domestic subsidiaries provide for federal income taxes on pretax accounting income at rates in
effect under existing tax law. Foreign subsidiaries record provisions for income taxes at applicable foreign tax rates in a similar manner. The payments made for state income taxes are included in Administrative and selling expenses as these costs
can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. Government in the period in which the tax is payable. Accordingly, the state income tax provision benefit is allocated to contracts in future periods as discussed
below in Deferred Contract Costs.  Other Income and ExpenseOther
income and expense consists primarily of gains and losses from our investments held in rabbi trusts used to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans, gains and losses on the early repurchase of long-term debt and certain
financing fees.  Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash
equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase.  Allowance for Doubtful AccountsWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of accounts receivable that will not be
collected. The allowance is based upon an assessment of customer credit-worthiness, historical payment experience, the age of outstanding receivables and collateral to the extent applicable.  Activity related to the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:  In millions Balance at December31, 2005 19 Provisions Utilizations 1 Balance at December31, 2006 18 Provisions Utilizations 10 Balance at December31, 2007 8 Provisions 2 Utilizations 2 Balance at December31, 2008 8
68 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
Contracts in ProcessContracts in process are stated at cost plus estimated profit, but not in excess of
estimated realizable value.  Deferred Contract CostsCertain costs
incurred in the performance of our U.S. Government contracts are required to be recorded under GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs are deferred and primarily include a portion of our environmental expenses, asset retirement
obligations, certain restructuring costs, deferred state income tax, workers compensation and other accruals. At December31, 2008 and December31, 2007, the net deferred contract costs were approximately $70 million and $80 million,
respectively. These costs are allocated to contracts when they are paid or otherwise agreed. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs. This assessment requires us to make assumptions about the extent of cost recovery under our
contracts and the amount of future contract activity. If the level of backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected.  Pension and other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to our contracts as allowed
costs based upon the U.S. Government cost accounting standards CAS. The CAS requirements for pension and other postretirement benefit costs differ from the financial accounting standards FAS requirements under U.S. GAAP. Given the inherent
difficulty in matching individual expense and income items between the CAS and FAS requirements to determine specific recoverability, we have not estimated the incremental FAS expense to be recoverable under our expected future contract activity,
and therefore have not deferred any FAS expense for pension and other postretirement benefit plans in 2006-2008. This resulted in $123 million, $259 million and $362 million of incremental expense reflected in our results of operations for 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively, for the difference between CAS and FAS requirements for our pension plans in those years.  InventoriesInventories are stated at cost first-in, first-out or average cost, but not in excess of realizable value. A write down for excess or inactive
inventory is recorded based upon an analysis that considers current inventory levels, historical usage patterns, future sales expectations and salvage value.  Inventories consisted of the following at December31:  In millions
2008
2007
Materials and purchased parts 56 63
Work in process 224 276
Finished goods 45 47
Total 325 386
We capitalize costs incurred in
advance of contract award or funding in inventory if we determine the contract award or funding is probable. These precontract costs exclude any start-up costs. We included capitalized precontract and other deferred costs of $85 million and $95
million in Inventories as work in process at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  Property, Plant and Equipment, NetProperty, plant and equipment, net are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major improvements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance, repairs and
minor improvements are expensed. Gains and losses resulting from the sale of plant and equipment at the government and defense businesses are included in overhead and reflected in the pricing of products and services to the U.S. Government. For all
other sales or asset retirements, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income.  Provisions for depreciation are generally computed using a combination of accelerated and straight-line methods. Depreciation provisions are
based on estimated useful lives as follows:  Years
Machinery and equipment
3-10
Equipment leased to others
5-10
Buildings
20-45
69 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the remaining life of the lease or the estimated useful life
of the improvement.  Impairment of Goodwill and Long-lived
AssetsWe comply with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS No142, which requires that we evaluate our goodwill for impairment at least annually
or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of that goodwill may not be recoverable. We perform our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter utilizing a two-step methodology that requires us to first identify potential
goodwill impairment and then measure the amount of the related goodwill impairment loss, if any. We have identified our operating segments as reporting units under the impairment test assessment criteria outlined in SFAS No142. In performing
our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 2007, we did not identify any goodwill impairment associated with our continuing operations.  In accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, we determine whether long-lived assets are to be held for use or
held for disposal. Upon indication of possible impairment, we evaluate the recoverability of held for use long-lived assets by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows. When an
evaluation indicates that the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset, the asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value. In order for long-lived assets to be considered held for disposal, we must
have committed to a plan to dispose of the assets. Once deemed held for disposal, the assets are stated at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value.  Computer SoftwareInternal use computer software, which consists primarily of an integrated financial package, is stated at cost less accumulated amortization
and is amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life, generally 10 years.  Advance Payments and Billings in Excess of Costs IncurredWe receive advances, performance-based payments and progress payments from customers that may exceed costs incurred on certain contracts. We
classify Advance payments and billings in excess of costs incurred, other than those reflected as a reduction of Contracts in process, as current liabilities. 
Product WarrantyWe provide for product warranties in conjunction with certain product sales where revenue is recognized upon delivery.  Activity related to warranty accruals was as follows:  In millions Balance at December31, 2005 31 Provisions for warranties in 2006 17 Warranty services provided in 2006 12 Balance at December31, 2006 36 Provisions for warranties in 2007 20 Warranty services provided in 2007 9 Balance at December31, 2007 47 Provisions for warranties in 2008 5 Warranty services provided in 2008 13 Balance at December31, 2008 39
We account for costs incurred under
warranty provisions performed under long-term contracts as contract costs using the cost-to-cost measure of progress and exclude these costs from the table above, as the estimation of these costs is an integral part of the pricing determination of
these long-term contracts.

Comprehensive IncomeComprehensive income and its components are presented in the consolidated statements
of stockholders equity.  Accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted
of the following at December31:  In millions
2008 2007 Unfunded projected benefit obligation 5,123 2,097 Foreign exchange translation 42 118 Cash flow hedges 19 21 Unrealized gains on interest-only strips 3 3 Interest rate lock 1 1 Total 5,182 1,956
The unfunded projected benefit
obligation is shown net of tax benefits of $2,759 million and $1,129 million at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The cash flow hedges are shown net of tax benefits of $10 million and net of tax liabilities of $11 million at
December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The unrealized gains on interest-only strips are shown net of tax liabilities of $2 million at December31, 2008 and 2007. The interest rate lock is shown net of tax benefits of $1 million at
December31, 2008 and 2007.  Translation of Foreign
CurrenciesAssets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at current exchange rates and the effects of these translation adjustments are reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss income in
Stockholders equity. Deferred taxes are not recognized for translation-related temporary differences of foreign subsidiaries as their undistributed earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Income and expenses in foreign
currencies are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses in 2008, 2007 and 2006 were not material.  Pension CostsWe have pension plans covering the majority of employees, including certain employees in foreign countries. We
must calculate our pension costs under both U.S. Government CAS and FAS requirements under U.S. GAAP. CAS prescribes the allocation to and recovery of pension costs on U.S. Government contracts through the pricing of products and services and the
methodology to determine such costs. SFAS No87, Employers Accounting for Pensions SFAS No87, the applicable standard under FAS, outlines the methodology used to determine pension expense or income for financial reporting
purposes. Annual charges to income are made for the cost of the plans, including current service costs, interest on projected benefit obligations and net amortization and deferrals, increased or reduced by the return on assets. The CAS requirements
for pension costs and its calculation methodology differ from the FAS requirements and calculation methodology. As a result, while both CAS and FAS use long-term assumptions in their calculation methodologies, each method results in different
calculated amounts of determined pension cost. In addition, the cash funding requirements for our pension plans are determined under the Employee Retirement Security Act ERISA.  We record CAS expense in the results of our business segments. Due to the differences between FAS and CAS amounts, we also present the
difference between FAS and CAS expense, referred to as our FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment, as a separate line item in our business segment results. This effectively increases or decreases the amount of pension expense in our results of operations so
such amount is equal to the FAS expense amount under SFAS No87.  For
purposes of determining SFAS No87 pension expense, investment gains and losses are spread over 3 years to develop a market-related value of the assets. 
We adopted SFAS No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB Statements No87, 88, 106 and 132R SFAS No158 as of December31, 2006. SFAS No158 requires us to recognize the funded status of a postretirement benefit plan defined benefit pension and other benefits as
an asset or liability on our consolidated balance sheet. Funded status represents the 
71 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
difference between the projected benefit obligation of the plan and the market value of the plans assets.
Previously unrecognized deferred amounts such as demographic or asset gains or losses and the impact of historical plan changes are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss income. Changes in these amounts in future years are adjusted as
they occur through Accumulated other comprehensive loss income. These amounts will be amortized and included in future pension expense over the average employee service period.  The adoption of SFAS No158 resulted in a $19 billion increase, from $23 billion to $42 billion, in Accrued retiree benefits and
other long-term liabilities and a corresponding $13 billion increase, net of taxes, in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in Stockholders equity. In addition, the intangible asset of $128 million previously established under SFAS
No87 was eliminated. In accordance with SFAS No158, prior periods have not been restated.  Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the currency exchange rate risk associated with forecasted foreign currency purchases and sales under our
customer contracts. We enter into pay-variable, receive-fixed interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our fixed-rate financing obligations.  We recognize all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet. We
designate foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies, and interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of our fixed-rate financing obligations. We classify the cash flows
from these instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  For foreign currency forward contracts designated and qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting, the effective portion of the gain or loss
on the derivative is reported as a component of Other comprehensive loss, net of tax, and recognized in earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged revenue or cost of sales transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on
derivatives not designated for hedge accounting, or representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings currently.  We account for our interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of a portion of our fixed-rate
financing obligations, and accordingly record gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these swaps in Interest expense, along with the offsetting gains and losses on the fair value adjustment of the hedged portion of our fixed rate
financing obligations. We also record in Interest expense the net amount paid or received under the swap for the period and the amortization of gain or loss from the early termination of interest rate swaps.  Employee Stock PlansStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date
based on the calculated fair value of the award. The expense is recognized over the employees requisite service period, generally the vesting period of the award. The expense is amortized over the service period using the graded vesting method
for our restricted stock and restricted stock units and the straight line amortization method for our Long Term Performance Plan LTPP. The related gross excess tax benefit received upon exercise of stock options or vesting of a stock-based award,
if any, is reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing activity rather than an operating activity.  Risks and UncertaintiesWe provide a wide range of technologically advanced products, services and solutions for principally governmental customers in the
U.S. and abroad, and are subject to certain business risks specific to that industry. Sales to the government may be affected by changes in procurement policies, budget considerations, changing concepts of national defense, political developments
abroad and other factors.  Note 2: Accounting Standards In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No133 SFAS
No161. SFAS No161 requires enhanced disclosures regarding an entitys derivative and hedging activities. These enhanced disclosures include information regarding how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; how derivative
instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 
72 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and its related interpretations; and how derivative instruments and related
hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS No161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November15, 2008. The adoption
of SFAS No161 will not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141R, Business Combinations SFAS No141R. SFAS No141R expands the definition of a business and establishes the use of the acquisition method for
business combinations. This method requires all assets and liabilities, including goodwill, of an acquired business to be measured at fair value on the acquisition date. Among other things, the standard requires entities to expense most transaction
and restructuring costs; establishes fair value measurement for contingent consideration in earnings; and requires capitalization of in-process research and development. The standard also modifies the recording and presentation of deferred taxes.
SFAS No141R will be applied prospectively to business combinations with acquisition dates on or after January1, 2009. Our adoption of SFAS No141R is not expected to materially impact our consolidated financial position,
results of operations or liquidity when it becomes effective. Subsequent to our adoption of SFAS No141R, the resolution of existing balances related to uncertain tax positions from prior acquisitions that differ from previously recorded
amounts will be adjusted through earnings.  In December 2007, the FASB issued
SFAS No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No51, Consolidated Financial Statements SFAS No160. SFAS No160 changes the accounting and reporting
for minority interests by recharacterizing them as noncontrolling interests and classifying them as a component of Stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheet. Our consolidated statements of operations will include: net income from
Raytheon and the minority stockholders share of earnings and a new category called net earnings attributable to Raytheon, which is similar to our current presentation of Net income. SFAS No160 will also expand disclosures to clearly
distinguish between our interests and the interests of noncontrolling owners. Our primary noncontrolling interest relates to Thales-Raytheon Systems Co. LLC TRS LLC, which we control and consolidate. Both TRS LLC and Thales-Raytheon Systems
Co. Ltd. TRS, an equity method investment which has the principal economic interest in TRS LLC, are components in computing the operating results of our Network Centric Systems segment. Upon adoption of SFAS No160, we will present the
noncontrolling interest in TRS LLC and the related equity method investment in TRS net of any obligations or interests to Raytheon. This will effectively reduce the minority interest in TRS LLC and the balance of our equity investment in TRS. The
effect of this as of December31, 2008 and December31, 2007 will be to reduce the balance of the equity investment in TRS by $162 million and $133 million, respectively, with a corresponding decrease in the reported noncontrolling
interest. SFAS No160 is effective beginning January1, 2009 and will be applied prospectively, except for presentation and disclosure requirements, which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. SFAS No160 does
not impact the calculation of Net income or Earnings per share attributable to Raytheon shareholders.  Other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after December31, 2008, are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  Note 3: Acquisitions In 2008, we paid $52 million in cash to acquire Telemus Solutions, Inc. and SI Government Solutions at Intelligence Information Systems IIS. We recorded $39 million of goodwill and $9 million in intangible assets in
connection with these acquisitions.  In 2007, we paid $211 million in cash to
acquire Oakley Networks, Inc. at IIS and the robotics technologies and capabilities of Sarcos at Integrated Defense Systems IDS. We recorded $38 million in intangible assets, primarily related to completed technology and customer relationships
with a weighted-average life of 6 years and $165 million of goodwill in connection with these acquisitions.  In 2006, we paid $87 million in cash to acquire Virtual Technology Corporation and Houston Associates, Inc. at Network Centric Systems NCS. We recorded $18 million in intangible assets and $60 million in goodwill in
connection with these acquisitions. 
73 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
Pro forma financial information has not been provided for these acquisitions as they are not material either
individually or in the aggregate.  We funded each of the above acquisitions
using cash on hand. The operating results of these businesses have been included with our consolidated results as of the respective closing dates of the acquisitions. The purchase price of these businesses has been allocated to the estimated fair
value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. We completed these acquisitions to enhance our technology portfolio. Tax deductible goodwill related to these acquisitions totaled $72
million.  Note 4: Discontinued Operations Operating loss income from discontinued operations, net of tax, consisted of the following results from Raytheon Aircraft, Flight Options, and Other Discontinued
Operations, composed of Raytheon Engineers Constructors and Aircraft Integration Systems:  Pretax After-tax In millions

In 2007, we sold our Raytheon Aircraft
Company Raytheon Aircraft and Flight Options LLC Flight Options businesses. As a result, we present Raytheon Aircraft, Flight Options and our other previously disposed businesses Other Discontinued Operations as discontinued operations for all
periods. All residual activity relating to our disposed businesses appears in discontinued operations. We sold Raytheon Aircraft for $3,318 million in gross proceeds, $3,117 million, net. We recorded a gain on sale of $986 million, net of $612
million of federal, foreign and state taxes. We sold Flight Options and recorded a loss on sale of $73 million pretax, $44 million after-tax. In connection with the sale of Flight Options we recorded a note receivable for $9 million, which was
subsequently collected in 2008.  In 2007, we sought and received a number of
initial bids to purchase Flight Options. These initial bids were below our previous estimates of Flight Options fair value, which was based upon its projected discounted cash flows. As a result of receiving these external indications of market
value and other conditions and events that occurred during the year, we recorded an impairment charge of $84 million pretax, $69 million after-tax in 2007, which included all of Flight Options remaining goodwill and a portion of its other
intangible assets. In 2006, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $55 million pretax, $48 million after-tax, related to Flight Options.  We retained certain assets and liabilities of these disposed businesses. At December31, 2008 and December31, 2007, we had $71 million and $61 million,
respectively, in non-current assets primarily related to our subordinated retained interest in general aviation finance receivables previously sold by Raytheon Aircraft. At December31, 2008 and December31, 2007, we had $77 million and
$88 million, respectively, primarily in current liabilities related to certain environmental and product liabilities, aircraft lease obligations, non-income tax obligations, and various contract obligations. We also have certain income tax
obligations relating to these disposed businesses, which we include in our income tax disclosures. The Internal Revenue Service recently concluded a federal excise tax audit and assessed us additional excise tax related to the treatment of certain
Flight Options customer fees and charges, which we have appealed. We continue to believe that an unfavorable outcome is not probable and expect that any potential liability will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results
of operations or liquidity. We also retained certain U.K. pension assets and obligations for a limited number of U.K. pension plan participants as part of the Raytheon Aircraft sale, which we include in our pension disclosures. 
74 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
No interest expense was allocated to discontinued operations for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and
2006 since there was no debt specifically attributable to discontinued operations or required to be repaid with proceeds from the sales.  The income loss from discontinued operations related to Raytheon Aircraft and Flight Options was as follows:  Raytheon Aircraft

The U.S. Government has title to the
assets related to unbilled amounts on contracts that provide for progress payments. Unbilled amounts are recorded under the percentage of completion method and are recoverable from the customer upon shipment of the product, presentation of billings
or completion of the contract. Included in unbilled at December31, 2008 was $226 million which is expected to be collected outside of one year. 
75 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
Billed and unbilled contracts in process include retentions arising from contractual provisions. At December31,
2008, retentions were $69 million and are anticipated to be collected as follows: $53 million in 2009 and the balance thereafter.  Note 6: Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Property, plant and equipment, net

Long-term receivables included
commuter aircraft receivables related to our residual commuter aircraft portfolio in which the underlying aircraft serve as collateral of $58 million and $123 million at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We maintain reserves for
estimated uncollectible aircraft-related long-term receivables. The balance of these reserves was $1 million and $2 million at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The reserves for estimated uncollectible aircraft-related long-term
receivables represent our current estimate of future losses.  We accrue
interest, generally at rates between 55% and 80%, on aircraft-related long-term receivables in accordance with the terms of the underlying notes. When an aircraft-related long-term receivable is over 90 days past due, we generally stop accruing
interest. At December31, 2008 and 2007, there were no aircraft-related long-term receivables on which we were not accruing interest.  In 2006, we sold $64 million of general aviation finance receivables without any continuing involvement. In 2006, we also sold an undivided interest of general aviation
finance receivables, while retaining a subordinated interest in and servicing rights to the receivables. We received proceeds of $67 million and recognized a gain of $1 million. We irrevocably, and without recourse, transferred the receivables to
the qualifying special purpose entity QSPE, formed in 2003, which in turn, issued beneficial interests in these receivables to a commercial paper conduit. The transaction involves a third party guarantee of the conduit investment. The assets of
the QSPE are not available to pay the claims of the Company or any other entity. We retained a subordinated interest in the receivables sold of approximately 3%. The conduit obtained the funds to purchase the interest in the receivables, other than
the retained interest, by selling commercial paper to third-party investors. We retained responsibility for the collection and administration of receivables. We continue to service the sold receivables and charge the third party conduit a monthly
servicing fee at market rates. 
76 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
We accounted for the sale under SFAS No140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishment of Liabilities. The gain was determined at the date of transfer based upon the relative fair value of the assets sold and the interests retained. We estimated the fair value at the date of transfer and at December31, 2008 and
2007 based on the present value of future expected cash flows using certain key assumptions, including collection period and a discount rate of 73%, 44% and 70%, respectively. At December31, 2008, a 10% and 20% adverse change in the
collection period and discount rate would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.  At December31, 2008 and 2007, the outstanding balance of securitized accounts receivable held by the third party conduit totaled $99 million and $135 million,
respectively, of which our subordinated retained interest was $66 million and $63 million, respectively, and the fair value of the servicing liability was less than $1 million at both December31, 2008 and 2007. The underlying aircraft serve as
collateral for these accounts receivable.  Computer software amortization
expense was $79 million, $75 million and $70 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and is expected to approximate $75 million for each of the next five years. Accumulated amortization of computer software was $496 million and $422 million at
December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  Other intangible assets subject
to amortization, which are included in other noncurrent assets, net in the table above, consisted primarily of drawings and intellectual property totaling $71 million, net of $59 million of accumulated amortization, at December31, 2008 and $78
million, net of $49 million of accumulated amortization, at December31, 2007. Amortization expense for these intangible assets was $19 million, $9 million and $7 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and is expected to approximate $20
million for each of the next five years.  Investments, which are included in

In general, we record our share of the
income or loss in our equity method investments as a component of Cost of sales.  In addition, we have entered into certain joint ventures formed specifically to facilitate a teaming arrangement between two contractors for the benefit of the customer, generally the U.S. Government, whereby we receive a subcontract from
the joint venture in the joint ventures capacity as prime contractor. Accordingly, we record the work we perform for the joint venture as an operating activity.  In 2001, we formed a joint venture, TRS, which we account for using the equity method. TRS is a system of systems integrator and provides
fully customized solutions through the integration of command and control centers, radars and communication networks. TRS has two major operating subsidiaries, one of which, TRS LLC, we control and consolidate, and the other one, Thales-Raytheon
Systems Company S.A.S. TRS SAS, which we account for using the equity method through our investment in TRS. The minority interest on TRS LLC is reflected as a component of Cost of sales. Amounts included in Cost of sales were $48 million, $53
million and $46 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Of the $227 million investment in TRS, $164 million represents undistributed earnings at December31, 2008.  TRS LLC formed a joint venture with TRS SAS called Air Command Systems International ACSI, for which TRS LLC performs work. As of
December31, 2008, TRS LLC had $53 million of receivables due from ACSI. 
77 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
Note 8: Financial Instruments We record foreign exchange forward contracts entered into as cash flow hedges at their fair value. Unrealized gains of $81 million were included in non-current assets and unrealized losses of $107 million were included in current
liabilities. For foreign currency forward contracts designated and qualified for hedge accounting, the offset was included in Other comprehensive loss, net of tax, of which approximately $19 million of net unrealized losses are expected to be
reclassified to earnings over the next twelve months as the underlying transactions mature. Gains and losses resulting from these cash flow hedges offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying assets or liabilities being hedged. The
maturity dates of the forward exchange contracts outstanding at December31, 2008 extend through 2020. Certain immaterial contracts were not designated as effective hedges and therefore were included in Cost of sales. The amount charged to
expense related to these contracts was approximately $1 million in 2008 and less than $1 million in 2007 and 2006.  We enter into interest rate swaps, as described in Note 10: Notes Payable and Long-term Debt. These interest rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges. There was no
hedge ineffectiveness in 2008, 2007 and 2006.  Major currencies and the

Buy amounts represent the
U.S.Dollar equivalent of commitments to purchase foreign currencies and sell amounts represent the U.S.Dollar equivalent of commitments to sell foreign currencies. Foreign exchange contracts that do not involve U.S. Dollars have been
converted to U.S. Dollars for disclosure purposes.  Foreign currency forward
contracts, used to fix the dollar value of specific commitments and payments to international vendors and the value of foreign currency denominated receipts, have maturities at various dates through 2020 as follows: $867 million in 2009, $227
million in 2010, $99 million in 2011, $60 million in 2012 and $108 million thereafter.  Our interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts contain off-set, or netting provisions, to mitigate credit risk in the event of counterparty default, including payment default and cross default. At December31, 2008,
these netting provisions effectively reduced our net exposure to approximately $50 million for our interest rate swap agreements and $20 million for our foreign exchange contracts. Our net exposure is spread across several counterparties and no
individual counterparty represented more than 20% of the net exposure. Subsequent to December31, 2008, our interest rate swap agreements were unwound.  Note 9: Fair Value Measurement The estimated fair value of certain financial
instruments, including cash, cash equivalents and short-term debt approximates the carrying value due to their short maturities and varying interest rates. The estimated fair value of notes receivable approximates the carrying value based
principally on the underlying interest rates and terms, maturities, collateral and credit status of the receivables. The estimated fair value of Long-term debt of approximately $25 billion at December31, 2008 and $24 billion at
December31, 2007 was based on quoted market prices.  In 2008, we adopted
SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS No157, for our financial assets and liabilities. Our adoption of SFAS No157 did not impact our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. In accordance with FASB Staff
Position No. FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No157 FSP FAS 157-2, we elected to defer until 
78 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
January1, 2009 the adoption of SFAS No157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities not recognized or disclosed at fair value in
the financial statements on a recurring basis. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No157 for those assets and liabilities within the scope of FSP FAS 157-2 to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or
liquidity. We did not have any nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities that would be recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis as of December31, 2008.  SFAS No157 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS
No157 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
measurement date. SFAS No157 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required by SFAS No157, as well
as the assets and liabilities that we value using those levels of inputs.  Level1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Our Level 1 assets are investments in marketable securities held in Rabbi Trusts that we use to pay benefits under certain
of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Our Level 1 liabilities include our obligations to pay certain non-qualified deferred compensation plan benefits. Under these non-qualified deferred compensation plans, participants designate
investment options primarily mutual funds to serve as the basis for measurement of the notional value of their accounts. We also include foreign exchange forward contracts that we trade in an active exchange market in our Level 1 assets and
liabilities. Level2 Observable inputs, other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or we
corroborate by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities. Our Level 2 assets are interest rate swaps whose fair value we determine using a pricing model predicated upon observable market
inputs. Level3 Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Our Level 3 asset relates to our subordinated retained
interest in general aviation finance receivables Subordinated Retained Interest that we sold in previous years. We estimated the fair value for this asset based on the present value of the future expected cash flows using certain unobservable
inputs, including the collection periods for the underlying receivables and a credit adjusted rate of 44% at December 31, 2008 and 70% at December 31, 2007. These unobservable inputs reflect our suppositions about the assumptions market
participants would use in pricing this asset.
The following table sets forth the
financial assets and liabilities as of December31, 2008 that we measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy. As required by SFAS No157, we classify assets and liabilities measured at fair value
in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement.  In millions

in order to effectively hedge interest rate risk. The $575 million notional value of the interest rate swaps that remained outstanding at December31, 2008 effectively converted $250 million of the 485% Notes due 2011 and $325 million of the
5375% Notes due 2013 to variable-rate debt based on six-month LIBOR.  The

We have a $22 billion bank revolving credit facility under which we can draw on lines of credit, issue letters of
credit and backstop commercial paper. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 40 basis points based on Raytheons credit rating at December31, 2008. The credit facility is comprised of commitments from
approximately thirty separate highly rated lenders, each committing no more than 10% of the entire facility. The credit facility matures in March 2010 and we intend to renew prior to maturity. The terms of the renewed facility, including the amount
of the facility, maturity, pricing and covenants, will depend on market conditions at the time of renewal. As of December31, 2008 and December31, 2007, there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. However, we had
approximately $40 million and $60 million of outstanding letters of credit at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which effectively reduced our borrowing capacity under the credit facility by that same amount at each of the respective
dates.  Under our credit facility, we must comply with certain covenants,
including a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no more than 50% and a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense, for any period of four consecutive
fiscal quarters, of no less than 30 to 10. We were in compliance with the covenants during 2008 and 2007.  Certain of our foreign subsidiaries maintain revolving bank lines of credit to provide them with a limited amount of short-term liquidity. In 2005, Raytheon United Kingdom Limited, a U.K. subsidiary, entered into a
three year, $150 million committed multicurrency revolving credit facility that expired on December15, 2008 and was not renewed. There were no borrowings under the facility at December31, 2007. In addition, other uncommitted bank lines
totaled approximately $10 million at December31, 2008 and $15 million at December31, 2007. There were no amounts outstanding under these lines of credit at December31, 2008 and 2007. Compensating balance arrangements are not
material.  Total cash paid for interest on notes payable and long-term debt was
$142 million, $232 million and $273 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  Equity Security UnitsIn 2001, we issued 17,250,000, 825%, $50 par value equity security units. Each equity security unit consisted of a contract to purchase shares of our common stock on May15, 2004 and a mandatorily
redeemable equity security with a stated liquidation amount of $50 due on May15, 2006. The mandatorily redeemable equity security represented preferred stock of RC Trust I RCTI, a subsidiary of the Company that initially issued this
preferred stock to the Company in exchange for a subordinated note. The subordinated notes had the same terms as the mandatorily redeemable equity security and represented an undivided interest in the assets of RCTI whose assets consisted solely of
subordinated notes issued by the Company.  In 2004, in accordance with the
terms of the equity security units, we issued 270million shares of common stock and received proceeds of $863 million. In 2004, subordinated notes with a par value of $481 million were repurchased at a loss of $32 million pretax, which was
included in Other expense income, net. In 2006, $408 million of subordinated notes payable matured, which consisted of a payment of $382 million and a reduction in our investment in RCTI of $26 million. The contract required a quarterly
distribution, which was recorded as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital, of 125%per year of the stated amount of $50 per purchase contract. The subordinated notes paid a quarterly distribution, which was included in interest expense, of
70%per year.

Note 11: Commitments and Contingencies At December31, 2008, we had commitments under long-term leases requiring annual rentals on a net lease basis as follows:  In millions 2009 273

Rent expense in 2008, 2007 and 2006
was $285 million, $276 million and $264 million, respectively. In the normal course of business, we lease equipment, office buildings and other facilities under leases that include standard escalation clauses for adjusting rent payments to reflect
changes in price indices, as well as renewal options.  At December31,
2008, we had commitments under agreements to outsource a significant portion of our information technology function requiring minimum annual payments as follows:  In millions 2009 74

Thereafter  We expect to enter into a new
agreement to replace one of our existing information technology outsourcing agreements when it expires in 2009, which represents a substantial portion of the 2009 payment above. Terms for a new arrangement are currently being evaluated and are not
included in the table above.  Insurance is purchased from third parties to
cover aggregate liability exposure up to $15 billion. The aircraft product liability reserve, which was not part of our sale of Raytheon Aircraft, was $8 million and $16 million at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Prior to the sale of
Raytheon Aircraft, we self-insured for losses and expenses for aircraft product liability up to a maximum of $10 million per occurrence and $50 million annually, and insurance was purchased from third parties to cover excess aggregate liability
exposure from $50 million to $125 billion as well as the excess liability over $10 million per occurrence.  We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to remediation of various environmental sites. Our estimate of total environmental remediation costs is $157 million at December31, 2008.
Discounted at a weighted-average risk-free rate of 57%, we estimate the liability to be $105 million before U.S. Government recovery and had this amount accrued at December31, 2008. A portion of these costs are eligible for future recovery
through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government. We consider such recovery probable based on government contracting regulations and our long history of receiving reimbursement for such costs. Accordingly, we recorded $69
million in Contracts in process through December31, 2008 for the estimated future recovery of these costs from the U.S. Government. We also lease certain government-owned properties and are generally not liable for environmental remediation at
these sites; as a result, we generally do not reflect the provision for these costs in our consolidated financial statements. Due to the complexity of environmental laws and regulations, the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup
methods and technologies, the uncertainty of insurance coverage and the unresolved extent of our responsibility, it is difficult to determine the ultimate outcome of these matters; however, we do not expect any additional liability to have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

We issue guarantees and banks and
surety companies issue, on our behalf, letters of credit and surety bonds to meet various bid, performance, warranty, retention and advance payment obligations of us or our affiliates. Approximately $281 million, $1,012 million and $111 million of
these guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds, for which there were stated values, were outstanding at December31, 2008, respectively, and $261 million, $910 million and $104 million were outstanding at December31, 2007,
respectively. These instruments expire on various dates through 2015. Additional guarantees of project performance for which there is no stated value also remain outstanding.  Included in guarantees and letters of credit described above were $59 million and $180 million at December31, 2008, respectively and
$39 million and $193 million at December31, 2007, respectively, related to our joint venture in TRS.  We provide these guarantees and letters of credit to TRS and other affiliates to assist these entities in obtaining financing on more favorable terms, making bids on contracts and performing their contractual
obligations. While we expect these entities to satisfy their loans, project performance and other contractual obligations, their failure to do so may result in a future obligation to us. At December31, 2008 and 2007, we had an estimated
liability of $2 million and $3 million, respectively, related to these guarantees and letters of credit. We evaluate the risk of TRS and other affiliates failing to satisfy their loans, project performance and other contractual obligations described
above periodically. At December31, 2008 we believe the risk that TRS and other affiliates will not be able to perform or meet their obligations is minimal for the foreseeable future based on their current financial condition. All obligations
were current at December31, 2008.  Also included in guarantees and
letters of credit described above were $86 million and $6 million at December31, 2008, respectively, and $85 million and $21 million at December31, 2007, respectively, related to discontinued operations.  Our residual turbo-prop commuter aircraft portfolio has exposure to outstanding financing
arrangements with the aircraft serving as collateral. We have sold and leased commuter aircraft globally to thinly capitalized companies whose financial condition could be significantly affected by a number of factors, including rising fuel and
other costs, industry consolidation, declining commercial aviation market conditions and the U.S. Government budget for the Essential Air Service program. Based on recent economic trends, including tightening credit markets and volatile fuel costs,
these companies may increasingly experience difficulties meeting their financial commitments. At December31, 2008 and December31, 2007, our exposure on commuter aircraft assets held as inventory, collateral on notes or as leased assets,
was approximately $170 million relating to 127 aircraft and approximately $250 million relating to 156 aircraft, respectively. The carrying value of our commuter aircraft portfolio assumes an orderly disposition of these assets, consistent with our
historical experience and strategy. If we were to dispose of these assets in an other than orderly manner or sell the portfolio in its entirety, the value realized would likely be less than the carrying value.  In 1997, we provided a first loss guarantee of $133 million on $13 billion of U.S.
Export-Import Bank loans maturing in 2015 to the Brazilian Government related to the System for the Vigilance of the Amazon SIVAM program being performed by Network Centric Systems. Loan repayments by the Brazilian Government were current at
December31, 2008.  Government contractors are subject to many levels of
audit and investigation. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense and other 
83 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
departments and agencies, the Government Accountability Office, the Department of Justice and Congressional Committees. The Department of Justice, from time
to time, has convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by us. We also provide products and services to customers outside of the U.S. and those sales are subject to local government laws, regulations and procurement policies and
practices. Our compliance with such local government regulation or any applicable U.S. Government regulation e.g., the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations may also be investigated or audited. We do not
expect these audits and investigations to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, either individually or in the aggregate.  In 2006, Technical Services recorded a profit adjustment related to certain program costs which may be deemed unrecoverable. Although not
expected to be material, we may incur additional charges as we continue to assess and engage in discussions regarding the matter.  In May 2006, international arbitration hearings commenced against us as the successor to the Hughes Electronics defense business in connection with certain claims brought
in 2004 relating to an alleged 1995 Workshare Agreement. The asserted claims involve breach of contract, intellectual property infringement and other related matters. The arbitrator stayed the liability decision on certain of the claims while the
parties engage in settlement discussions. The ultimate resolution of this matter, however, remains uncertain and difficult to predict. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to these claims and intend to continue to contest them vigorously. An
adverse resolution of this matter could have a material effect on our results of operations.  In addition, various other claims and legal proceedings generally incidental to the normal course of business are pending or threatened against us. We do not expect any additional liability from these proceedings to
have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  Note 12: Stockholders Equity The changes in shares of our common stock outstanding were as follows:  In millions Balance at December31, 2005

In October 2008, our Board of
Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $20 billion of our outstanding common stock. As of December31, 2008 we had not repurchased any shares of our common stock under this program.  In October 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $20
billion of our outstanding common stock. As of December31, 2008, approximately $1,930 million of our common stock had been repurchased and approximately $70 million remained under this program.  
84 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
In December 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of our outstanding common
stock. This program was completed during the fourth quarter of 2007. In March 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of our outstanding common stock. This program was completed during the second quarter of 2007.
In November 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $700 million of our outstanding common stock. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2006.  Treasury stock is accounted for under the cost method. When shares are reissued or retired from treasury stock they are accounted for at
average price. Upon retirement the excess over par value is charged against Additional paid-in capital.  Included in treasury shares at December31, 2008 are 183,636 shares with a cost basis of $66 million which are held in a rabbi trust related to certain of the Companys non-qualified deferred compensation
plans.  We compute basic earnings per share EPS by dividing net income by the
weighted-average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS, which we calculate using the treasury stock method, reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised,
converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that would have shared in our earnings.  The weighted-average shares outstanding for basic and diluted EPS were as follows:  In millions

101million, 140million and 188million shares of common stock outstanding at December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, had exercise prices that were less than the average market price of our common stock during the
respective periods. We included these options in our calculation of diluted EPS.  We did not include stock options to purchase 24million, 31million and 68million shares of common stock outstanding in our calculation of diluted EPS at December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, as the effect
of such options would be anti-dilutive.  Our Board of Directors is authorized
to issue up to 200million shares of preferred stock, $001 par value per share, in multiple series with terms as determined by our Board of Directors. There were no shares of preferred stock outstanding at December31, 2008 and
December31, 2007.  In June 2006, we issued 120million warrants to
purchase our common stock, of which 120million were outstanding at December31, 2008, in connection with our settlement of a class action lawsuit. These warrants, expiring in 2011, were issued with an exercise price of $3750 per share
and have been included in the calculation of diluted EPS.  On January1,
2008, we adopted EITF Issue No06-4, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements, and EITF Issue No06-10, Accounting for Collateral Assignment
Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements. EITF Nos. 06-4 and 06-10 require us to recognize liabilities for the existing postretirement benefit aspects of our current split-dollar life insurance arrangements. The cumulative effect of adopting EITF
Nos. 06-4 and 06-10 resulted in a $16 million charge to Retained earnings as of January1, 2008. We did not grant any new or expanded benefits as a result of this change.

Note 13: Stock-based Compensation Plans We recorded $122 million, $109 million and $104 million of expense related to stock-based compensation in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We recorded $43 million, $38 million and $34 million as a tax benefit
related to stock-based compensation in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. At December31, 2008, there was $164 million of compensation expense related to nonvested awards not yet recognized which is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 16 years.  Shares issued as a result of stock
awards, stock option exercise or conversion of restricted stock unit awards will be funded through treasury stock or the issuance of new shares. Of the 343million shares authorized under the 2001 Stock Plan and the 1997 Nonemployee Directors
Restricted Stock Plan, there were 93million shares available for awards under such plans as of December31, 2008.  Restricted Stock The 2001 Stock Plan provides for the award of restricted
stock, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights. The 1997 Nonemployee Directors Restricted Stock Plan provides for the award of restricted stock to nonemployee directors. Awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock
appreciation rights generally are made by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors MDCC and are compensatory in nature. These awards vest over a specified period of time as determined by the MDCC, generally
four years for employee awards and one year for nonemployee directors. Restricted stock awards entitle the recipient to full dividend and voting rights beginning on the date of grant. Non-vested shares are restricted as to disposition and subject to
forfeiture under certain circumstances. The fair value at the date of award of restricted stock is credited to Common stock at par value. The fair value of restricted stock, calculated under the intrinsic value method at the date of award, is
charged to income as compensation expense over the vesting period with a corresponding credit to Additional paid-in capital.  No further grants are allowed under the 2001 Stock Plan or the 1997 Nonemployee Directors Restricted Stock Plan after January30, 2011 and November25, 2011,
respectively.  Restricted stock activity was

Long-Term Performance Plan In 2004, we established the Long-Term Performance Plan LTPP, which provides for restricted stock unit awards granted from the 2001 Stock Plan to our senior leadership.
These awards vest at the end of a three-year performance cycle based upon the achievement of specific pre-established levels of performance.

Note 14: Pension and Other Employee Benefits We have pension plans covering the majority of our employees, including certain employees in foreign countries Pension Benefits. Our primary pension obligations relate to our domestic IRS qualified pension plans.
For our domestic qualified pension plans the projected benefit obligation PBO, accumulated benefit obligation ABO and asset values for these plans were $15,419 million, $13,784 million, and $10,465 million, respectively, as of December31,
2008 and $15,130 million, $13,524 million, and $14,113 million, respectively, as of December31, 2007. The PBO represents the present value of pension benefits earned through the year end, with allowance for future salary increases. The ABO is
similar to the PBO, but does not allow for future salary increases. In addition to providing pension benefits, we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to retired employees through other postretirement benefit plans Other
Benefits. Substantially all of our U.S. employees may become eligible for the Other Benefits.  We adopted SFAS No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No87, 88, 106 and 132R SFAS No158 as of
December31, 2006. SFAS No158 requires us to recognize the funded status of a postretirement benefit plan defined benefit pension and other benefits as an asset or liability on our consolidated balance sheet. Funded status represents
the difference between the projected benefit liability obligation of the plan and the market value of the plans assets. Previously unrecognized deferred amounts such as demographic or asset gains or losses and the impact of historical plan
changes are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss income under SFAS No158. Changes in these amounts in future years are adjusted as they occur through Accumulated other comprehensive loss income.  The strategic asset allocation of our domestic Pension Benefits and Other Benefits plans is
diversified with an average and moderate level of risk consisting of investments in equity securities including domestic and international equities and our common stock, debt securities, real estate and other areas such as private equity and cash.
We seek to produce a return on investment over the long-term commensurate with levels of investment risk which are prudent and reasonable given the prevailing capital market expectations. Policy range allocations for our domestic pension plans are
20% to 55% for U. S. equity securities, 15% to 35% for international equity securities, 20% to 40% for debt securities, 2% to 10% for real estate, 0% to 20% for cash and 2% to 7% for other areas. The long-term return on asset ROA assumption for
our domestic Pension Benefits and Other Benefits plans for 2009 is 875%. The long-term ROA assumption for our domestic Pension Benefits and Other Benefits plans was 875% in 2008, 2007 and 2006. To develop the long-term ROA assumption, we perform
periodic studies which consider our asset allocation strategies, our recent and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, and the associated risk. In determining the long-term ROA assumption for 2008 and 2007, we compared
our analysis of our actual historical returns to a broader market long-term forecast adjusted for our asset allocation strategy net of an estimated long-term fee rate. In evaluating our asset allocation strategy, we determined that our higher
allocations of debt securities and cash at December31, 2008, compared to our long-term investment strategy, has been driven by recent market conditions and we intend to return to our long-term investment allocations once normal volatility
levels return to the market. In validating the 2008 long-term ROA assumption, we also reviewed our pension plan asset performance since the inception of SFAS No87, which includes the impact of the current downturn in the financial markets.
Our average actual annual rate of return since the inception of SFAS No87 has approximated our estimated 875% assumed return. Based upon these analyses and our internal investing targets, we determined our long-term ROA assumption for our
domestic pension plans in 2008 was 875%, consistent with our 2007 assumption. Our domestic pension plans actual rates of return were 2555%, 767% and 1658% for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The difference between the actual rate of return
and our long-term ROA assumption is included in deferred losses as discussed below. If we significantly changed our long-term investment allocation or strategy, then our long-term ROA assumption could change as well.  The long-term ROA assumptions for foreign Pension Benefits plans are based on the asset
allocations and the economic environment prevailing in the locations where the Pension Benefits plans reside. Foreign pension assets do not make up a significant portion of the total assets for all of our Pension Benefits plans.

The effect of a 1% increase or
decrease in the assumed health care trend rate for each future year for the aggregate of service cost and interest cost is $1 million or $1 million, respectively, and for the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is $16 million or $14
million, respectively.  The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan
assets for Pension Benefits plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $15,599 million and $10,089 million, respectively, at December31, 2008, and $15,045 million and $12,878 million, respectively, at
December31, 2007.  The accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of
plan assets for Pension Benefits plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $13,203 million and $9,387 million, respectively, at December31, 2008 and $6,304 million and $5,701 million, respectively, at
December31, 2007. The accumulated benefit obligation for all Pension Benefits plans was $14,630 million and $14,577 million at December31, 2008 and December31, 2007, respectively.  We make both discretionary and required contributions to our pension plans. Required
contributions are primarily determined by ERISA rules and are affected by the actual return on plan assets and plan funded status. As discretionary contributions are made, a funding credit is accumulated which can be used to offset future calculated
required contributions. The funding credit for our pension plans was $24 billion at December31, 2008 and $18 billion at December31, 2007. We made discretionary contributions of $660 million, $900 million and $200 million in 2008, 2007
and 2006, respectively. We made required contributions of $542 million, $459 million and $420 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. We expect to make required contributions of
approximately $1,110 million and $45 million to our pension and postretirement benefit plans, respectively, in 2009. We will continue to periodically evaluate whether to make additional discretionary contributions.  The table below reflects the total Pension Benefits expected to be paid from the plans or
from our assets, including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants share of the cost, which is funded by participant contributions. Other Benefits payments reflect our portion only.  In millions

We also maintain additional
contractual pension benefits agreements for our top executive officers. The liability was $29 million at December31, 2008 and 2007.  We maintain an employee stock ownership plan ESOP, which includes our 401k plan defined contribution plan, under which covered employees are allowed to contribute
up to a specific percentage of their pay. The Company matches the employees contribution, up to a maximum of generally between 3% and 4% of the employees pay, which is invested 
93 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
in the same way as employee contributions. Total expense for the Company match was $238 million, $230 million and $189 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.  Prior to January1, 2005, we made an annual contribution to
our common stock fund of approximately one-half of one percent of salaries and wages, subject to certain limitations Company Contributions. Effective January1, 2005, we discontinued the annual contribution to our common stock fund for most
U.S. salaried and hourly employees. Total expense for the Company Contributions was less than $1 million for 2008 and 2007 and $1 million for 2006 and the number of shares allocated to participant accounts was 600, 9,000 and 18,000 in 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively. We purchased shares on the open market for the Company Contributions in 2008, 2007 and 2006.  Effective January1, 2007, all eligible newly-hired or rehired employees participate in a new defined contribution plan in lieu of our existing pension plans,
subject to any applicable collective bargaining agreements. The total expense for the Company contributions to this plan was $25 million and $9 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our current eligible employees will continue to participate in
our existing pension plans without any changes to level of benefits or payment options.  At December31, 2008, there was $86 billion invested in our defined contribution plan. At December31, 2008, there was $15 billion invested in our common stock fund.  Note 15: Income Taxes The provision for federal and foreign income taxes consisted of the following:  In millions

reported for federal and foreign tax purposes differs from pretax income 
94 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
due to differences between U.S. Internal Revenue Code IRC or foreign tax law requirements and our accounting practices. No provision has been made for
deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as these earnings have been indefinitely reinvested. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable. Total
federal and foreign tax payments, net of refunds, were $448 million in 2008 compared to $734 million in 2007 and $375 million in 2006.  During 2007, we settled our federal research credit claim for the years 19841990 and certain domestic and Foreign Sales Corporation FSC issues for the years
19891997. IRS examinations of our tax returns have been completed through 2002 and IRS examination of our tax returns for 20032005 began in March 2007 and continued through 2008. We expect this examination to be completed in 2009. We
have protested to the IRS Appeals Division certain proposed adjustments primarily involving benefits under the FSC and Extraterritorial Income ETI exclusion regimes for 19982002. Additionally, we are under audit by a number of state tax
authorities. State tax liabilities are routinely adjusted to account for any changes in federal taxable income.  We believe we adequately provide for all tax positions, however, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than amounts accrued and reflected in our
consolidated balance sheet. Accordingly, we could record additional amounts for federal, foreign and state-related liabilities in the future as we revise estimates or we settle or otherwise resolve the underlying matters.  In 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes FIN 48, when accounting for our various tax positions, and recognized a $13 million increase in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which we accounted for as a reduction to Retained earnings. The balance of unrecognized tax benefits
at December31, 2008, exclusive of interest, was $415 million, of which $315 million would affect earnings if recognized. The balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2007, exclusive of interest, was $342 million, of which $250
million would affect earnings if recognized. We accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. As a result, in 2008, we recorded $26 million of gross interest and penalties, $17 million net of the federal tax
benefit, in tax expense. In 2007, we recorded $32 million of gross interest and penalties, $21 million net of the federal tax benefit, in tax expense. At December31, 2008, and 2007, respectively, we had approximately $96 million and $70
million of interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits, which, net of the federal tax benefit was approximately $63 million and $45 million, respectively. In the ordinary course of business, we may take new tax positions that
could increase or decrease unrecognized tax benefits in future periods.  A
rollforward of our unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:  In millions
2008 2007 Unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year 342 500 Additions based on current year tax positions 99 63 Reductions based on current year tax positions 1 Additions for prior year tax positions 38 34 Reductions for prior year tax positions 63 7 Settlements with taxing authorities 1 247 Unrecognized tax benefits, end of year 415 342
Although the final outcome remains
uncertain, we may reach a settlement with the IRS Appeals division in 2009 to resolve certain protested adjustments related to benefits claimed under the FSC and ETI regimes and certain other tax matters related to the years 19982002. As a
result, it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $25 million to $35 million, all of which could affect earnings.  We generally account for our state income tax expense as a deferred contract cost, as we can
generally recover these costs through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government. We include this deferred contract cost in Contracts in process until allocated to our contracts, which generally occurs upon payment or when
otherwise agreed as 
95 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
allocable with the U.S. Government. State income taxes allocated to our contracts were $122 million, $81 million and $29 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, and were included in Administrative and selling expenses.  The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provides a deduction for income derived from qualifying domestic production activities that is phased in over the 20052010 period. The deduction is equal to 3% of qualifying income in 2005 and 2006, 6% in
2007, 2008 and 2009, and 9% thereafter.  In December 2006, the Tax Relief and
Health Care Act of 2006 was enacted. This legislation retroactively reinstated the research tax credit for 2006. As a result, we recorded a discrete benefit of $6 million in the fourth quarter representing the benefit for the full year. The Tax
Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 also extended and modified the research tax credit for 2007.  In October 2008, the Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008 was enacted. This legislation retroactively reinstated the research and development tax credit for 2008. As a result, we recorded a
benefit of approximately $26 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 representing the benefit of the research and development tax credit for the full year.  Deferred income taxes consisted of the following at December31:  In millions

Current tax assets of $441 million at
December31, 2008 relates primarily to federal tax refunds expected to be received in the next year, and $337 million of these refunds were collected in January 2009. The Current tax asset of $98 million at December31, 2007 was collected
in 2008. The federal tax expense related to discontinued operations was $7 million, $581million and $68 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  As of December31, 2008 and 2007, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $40 million and $5 million, respectively. These federal net
operating loss carryforwards were acquired pursuant to our acquisitions of Oakley Networks, Inc. and Photon Research Associates, Inc. In general, Section382 of the IRC places annual limitations on the use of certain tax attributes, such as net
operating losses, in existence at the time of an ownership change. The entire balance of our federal net operating losses at December31, 2008 and 2007 is subject to annual limitations under IRC Section382. If unused, the net operating
loss carryforwards would begin to expire in 2027. We believe we will be able to utilize all of these carryforwards over the next five to six years.  As of December31, 2007, we had foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $30 million and have fully utilized all of our foreign tax credit carryforwards at
December31, 2008.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management has conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of December31, 2008.  Conclusion of EvaluationBased on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2008 were effective.  Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of ControlsIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any control,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.  Evaluation of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is set forth in Part II, Item8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe

Item8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Changes in Internal Control
Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2008 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over
financial reporting.  Subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2008, we implemented
