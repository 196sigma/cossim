48 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
DoubleClick Inc. In our opinion the consolidated financial
statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of DoubleClick
Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2003 and 2002,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December31,
2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion,
the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying
index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
financial statements. These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free from material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. As discussed in Notes1 and 6 to the
consolidated financial statements, on January1, 2002, the
Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.

NOTE1
Description of Business and Significant
Accounting Policies Description of business DoubleClick is a leading provider of products and
services used by direct marketers, Web publishers and
advertisers to plan, execute and analyze their marketing
programs. Combining technology and data expertise,
DoubleClicks solutions help its customers to optimize
their advertising and marketing campaigns online and through
direct mail. DoubleClick offers a broad array of technology and
data products and services to its customers to allow them to
address a full range of the marketing processes, from
pre-campaign planning and testing, and to execution, measurement
and campaign refinements. DoubleClick derives its revenues from two
business segments: TechSolutions and Data. DoubleClick
TechSolutions includes its ad management products, consisting of
the DART for Publishers Service, the DART Enterprise ad serving
software product, the DART for Advertisers Service and Motif,
and its marketing automation products, consisting of a suite of
email products based on DoubleClicks DARTmail Service and
campaign management and analytics products and services.
DoubleClick Data includes its Abacus and Data Management
divisions. Abacus utilizes the information contributed to the
proprietary Abacus database by Abacus Alliance members to make
direct marketing more effective for Abacus Alliance members and
other clients. Data Management was formed as a result of
DoubleClicks acquisition of Computer Strategy
Coordinators, Inc., which was completed on June30, 2003.
Data Management offers direct marketers solutions for building
and managing customer marketing databases, tools to plan,
execute and measure multi-channel marketing campaigns, as well
as list processing and data hygiene products and services. During 2002, through a series of transactions,
DoubleClick divested of its media businesses and as a result no
longer reports a DoubleClick Media segment. Basis of presentation The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of DoubleClick, its wholly owned
subsidiaries, and subsidiaries over which it exercises a
controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated. Investments in
entities in which DoubleClick does not have a controlling
financial interest, but over which it has significant influence
are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in which
DoubleClick does not have the ability to exercise significant
influence are accounted for using the cost method. Cash and cash equivalents, investments in
marketable securities and restricted cash Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and
highly liquid investments with a remaining contractual maturity
at the date of purchase of three months or less. Marketable securities consist of government and
corporate debt securities and are classified as current or
non-current assets depending on their dates of maturity. As of
December31, 2003, all marketable securities included in
non-current assets have maturities greater than one year. DoubleClick classifies its investments in
marketable securities as available-for-sale. Accordingly, these
investments are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses reported as a separate component of stockholders
equity. DoubleClick recognizes gains and losses when these
securities are sold using the specific identification method.
DoubleClick has not recognized any material gains or losses from
the sale of its investments in marketable securities. Restricted cash primarily represents amounts
placed in escrow relating to funds used to cover office lease
security deposits and our automated clearinghouse payment
function. 54 DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Property and equipment Property and equipment is recorded at cost and
depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of
the estimated life of the asset or the lease term. As required
by SOP 98-1, Accounting for Costs of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, DoubleClick
capitalizes certain computer software developed or obtained for
internal use. Capitalized software is depreciated using the
straight-line method over the estimated life of the software,
generally three to five years. Goodwill and intangible
assets DoubleClick records as goodwill the excess of
purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net
assets acquired. SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, prescribes a two-step process for
impairment testing of goodwill, which is performed annually, as
well as when an event triggering impairment may have occurred.
The first step tests for impairment, while the second step, if
necessary, measures the 55 DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2003 impairment. DoubleClick has elected to perform
its annual analysis as of October 1st of each fiscal year. See
Note 8 Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangibles. Intangible assets include patents, trademarks,
customer relationships and purchased technology. Such intangible
assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives, which are generally two to five years. Impairment of long-lived
assets DoubleClick assesses the recoverability of
long-lived assets, including intangible assets, held and used
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that future
cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, expected
to be generated by an assets disposition or use may not be
sufficient to support its carrying amount. If such undiscounted
cash flows are not sufficient to support the recorded value of
assets, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying
value of long-lived assets to their estimated fair value. Revenue recognition DoubleClicks revenues are presented net of
a provision for advertiser credits, which is estimated and
established in the period in which services are provided. These
credits are generally issued in the event that delivered
advertisements do not meet contractual specifications. Actual
results could differ from these estimates. TechSolutions.
Revenues include fees earned from the
use of our ad management and marketing automation products and
services. Revenues derived from DoubleClicks hosted, or
Web-based, applications, including the DART for Publishers
Service, the DART for Advertisers Service and DARTmail, are
recognized in the period the advertising impressions or emails
are delivered, provided collection of the resulting receivable
is reasonably assured. DART Service activation fees are deferred
and recognized ratably over the expected term of the customer
relationship. For DoubleClicks licensed ad serving and
campaign management software solutions, revenues are recognized
when product installation is complete, which generally occurs
when customers begin utilizing the product, there is pervasive
evidence of an arrangement, collection is reasonably assured,
the fee is fixed or determinable and vendor-specific objective
evidence exists to allocate the total fees to all elements of
the arrangement. A portion of the initial ad serving software
license fee is attributed to the customers right to
receive, at no additional charge, software upgrades released
during the subsequent twelve months. Revenues attributable to
software upgrades are deferred and recognized ratably over the
period covered by the software license agreement, which is
generally one year. Revenues from consulting services are recognized
as the services are performed and customer-support revenues are
deferred and recognized ratably over the period covered by the
customer support agreement, which is generally one year. Data. Abacus
provides services to its clients that result in a deliverable
product in the form of consumer and business prospect lists.
Revenues are recognized when the product is shipped to the
client, provided collection of the resulting receivable is
reasonably assured. Data Management provides list processing,
database development and database management services. List
processing and database development revenues are recognized in
the period that the product is completed and delivered, provided
that collection is reasonably assured. Database management
revenues are recognized as the services are provided. 56 DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2003 Product development Product development expenses consist primarily of
compensation and related benefits, consulting fees and other
operating expenses associated with product development
departments. The product development departments perform
research and development, enhance and maintain existing products
and provide quality assurance. Software development costs are
required to be capitalized when a products technological
feasibility has been established by completion of a working
model of the product and ending when a product is available for
general release to customers. To date, completions of a working
model of DoubleClicks products and general release have
substantially coincided. As a result, DoubleClick has not
capitalized any software development costs. Issuance of stock by
affiliates Changes in DoubleClicks interest in its
affiliates arising as the result of their issuance of common
stock are recorded as gains and losses in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations, except for any transactions that must
be recorded directly to equity in accordance with the provisions
of SAB No51. Advertising expenses DoubleClick expenses the cost of advertising and
promoting its services as incurred. Such costs are included in
sales and marketing in the consolidated statements of operations
and totaled $31million, $36million and
$128million for the years ended December31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. Income taxes DoubleClick uses the asset and liability method
of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to the differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and to operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in results of operations in the period that
includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided
to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the
weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not
some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. Foreign currency The functional currencies of DoubleClicks
foreign subsidiaries are their respective local currencies. The
financial statements maintained in local currencies are
translated to United States dollars using period-end rates of
exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates during the
period for revenues, cost of revenues and expenses. Translation
gains and losses are accumulated as a separate component of
stockholders equity. Net gains and losses from foreign
currency transactions are included in the consolidated
statements of operations and were not significant during the
periods presented. Equity-based compensation DoubleClick accounts for its employee stock
option plans under the intrinsic value method, in accordance
with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board
APB Opinion No25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations.
Under APB 25, generally no compensation expense is recorded when
the terms of the award are fixed and the exercise price of the
employee stock option equals or exceeds the fair value of the
underlying stock on the date of the grant. DoubleClick has
adopted the disclosure-only 57 DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2003 requirements of SFAS No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation which allows
entities to continue to apply the provisions of APB No25
for transactions with employees and provide pro forma net income
and pro forma earnings per share disclosures for employee stock
grants made as if the fair value based method of accounting in
SFAS No123 had been applied to these transactions. In December 2002, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board the FASB issued SFAS No148,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Transition and Disclosure which amends SFAS No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. See
New accounting pronouncements. Had DoubleClick determined compensation expense
of employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of
the stock options at the grant date, consistent with the
guidelines of SFAS No123, DoubleClicks net income
would have decreased and net loss would have increased to the

At December31, 2003, 2002, and 2001
outstanding options of approximately 120million,
187million and 239million, respectively, to
purchase shares of common stock were not included in the
computation of diluted net income loss per share because to do
so would have had an antidilutive effect for the periods
presented. Similarly, the computation of diluted net income
loss per share at December31, 2003, excludes the effect
of 103million shares issuable upon conversion of the Zero
Coupon Subordinated Notes due 2023. In addition, at
December31, 2002 and 2001, the effect of 38million
and 53million shares, respectively, issuable upon
conversion of the 475% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006
were excluded since their inclusion would also have had an
antidilutive effect. Concentrations of credit risk Financial instruments that potentially subject
DoubleClick to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily
of cash and cash equivalents, investments in marketable
securities and accounts receivable. Credit is extended to customers based on an
evaluation of their financial condition and collateral is not
required. DoubleClick performs ongoing credit assessments of its
customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts. DoubleClicks financial instruments consist
of cash and cash equivalents, investments in marketable
securities, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts
payable, accrued expenses and convertible subordinated notes. At
December31, 2003 and 2002 the fair value of these
instruments approximated their financial statement-carrying
amount with the exception of the convertible subordinated notes.
The Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2023 had an
estimated fair value of $1387million at December31,
2003. The 475% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 had an
estimated fair value of $1356million at December31,
2002. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. 59 DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2003 Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior
years financial statements to conform to current year
presentation. New accounting pronouncements In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board the FASB, issued SFAS No150,
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity SFAS
No150. SFAS No150 establishes standards for
how a company classifies and measures certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
SFAS No150 is effective for financial instruments entered
into or modified after May31, 2003, and otherwise is
effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning
after June15, 2003 with the exception of an indefinite
deferral relating to application to limited life entities. The
adoption of SFAS No150 did not have a material effect on
DoubleClicks financial position, results of operations or
cash flows. On April30, 2003, the FASB issued SFAS
No149, Amendment of Statement133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS
No149. SFAS No149 amends SFAS No133
for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging
activities. SFAS No149 requires contracts with comparable
characteristics to be accounted for similarly. In particular,
SFAS No149 clarifies when a contract with an initial net
investment meets the characteristic of a derivative and
clarifies when a derivative that contains a financing component
will require special reporting in the statement of cash flows.
SFAS No149 is effective for contracts entered into or
modified after June30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS
No149 did not have a material effect on
DoubleClicks financial position, results of operations or
cash flows. In January 2003, FASB issued Interpretation
No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities FIN46. This interpretation of
Accounting Research Bulletin No51, Consolidated
Financial Statements, addresses consolidation by business
enterprises of variable interest entities that either
1do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to
permit the entity to finance its activities without additional
subordinated financial support, or 2are owned by equity
investors who lack an essential characteristic of a controlling
financial interest. FIN46 applies immediately to variable
interest entities created after January31, 2003. With
regard to variable interest entities already in existence prior
to February1, 2003, the implementation of FIN46 has
been delayed and currently applies to the first fiscal year or
interim period beginning after December15, 2003. FIN 46
requires disclosure of variable interest entities in financial
statements issued after January31, 2003, if it is
reasonably possible that as of the transition date 1an
entity will be the primary beneficiary of an existing variable
interest entity that will require consolidation, or 2an
entity will hold a significant variable interest in, or have
significant involvement with, an existing variable interest
entity. DoubleClick does not have any entities as of
December31, 2003 that will require disclosure or new
consolidation as a result of adopting the provisions of FIN 46. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS
No148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure
SFAS No148. SFAS No148 amends SFAS
No123, Stock-Based Compensation, SFAS
No123, to provide alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method
of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In
addition, SFAS No148 amends the disclosure requirements
of SFAS No123 to require prominent disclosures in both
annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect
of the method used on reported results. The disclosure
provisions of SFAS No148 are effective for fiscal years
ending after December15, 2002 and have been incorporated
into these financial statements and accompanying footnotes. 60 DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2003 In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF reached a consensus on the scope of the
provisions of Issue00-21, Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables, addressing how to account for
arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of
multiple products, services, and/or rights to use assets. Under
EITF00-21, revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables
are divided into separate units of accounting if the
deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria:
1the delivered item has value to the customer on a
standalone basis; 2there is objective and reliable
evidence of the fair value of undelivered items; and
3delivery of any undelivered item is probable.
Arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate
units of accounting based on their relative fair values, with
the amount allocated to the delivered item being limited to the
amount that is not contingent on the delivery of additional
items or meeting other specified performance conditions.
EITF00-21 is applicable to agreements entered into in
fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2003. The
application of EITF00-21 did not have a material effect on
DoubleClicks financial condition or operating results. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No146,
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities SFAS No146. SFAS
No146 nullifies EITF Issue No94-3, Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other
Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring EITF94-3. The principal difference
between SFAS No146 and EITF94-3 relates to the
recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or
disposal activity. SFAS No146 requires that a liability
be recognized for those costs only when the liability is
incurred, that is, when it meets the definition of a liability
in the FASBs conceptual framework. In contrast,
EITF94-3 required recognition of a liability for an exit
cost when management committed to an exit plan. SFAS
No146 also establishes fair value as the objective for
initial measurement of liabilities related to exit or disposal
activities. SFAS No146 is effective for exit or disposal
activities that are initiated after December31, 2002 and
has no effect on exit or disposal activities begun prior to this
date. Change in Accounting Estimate Effective June15, 2003, DoubleClick changed
its estimate of the useful lives of its furniture and fixtures
and leasehold improvements located at its New York headquarters.
The average remaining useful life for these assets was reduced
from approximately two and twelve years for furniture and
fixtures and leasehold improvements, respectively, to six and
one half months for both asset types in order to recognize
depreciation expense over the remaining time that the assets
were expected to remain in service. The change was due to the
relocation of DoubleClicks New York headquarters in the
fourth quarter of 2003. On August19, 2003, DoubleClick
entered into a Lease Termination Agreement to terminate the
lease for its facility located in San Francisco. As a result of
this lease termination, DoubleClick accelerated the amortization
of its leasehold improvements at this facility due to the change
in useful life of these assets. The average remaining useful
life of these assets was reduced from approximately nine years
to one month as DoubleClick vacated this facility on
September19, 2003. As a result of these changes for the
New York and San Francisco facilities, net income was reduced by
approximately $146million, or $010 per basic and diluted
share, for the year ended December31, 2003. The
amortization of these assets is allocated over headcount and
therefore impacts cost of revenue, sales and marketing, general
and administrative and product development expenses. Effective January1, 2002, DoubleClick
changed its estimate of the useful lives of its production
equipment and software. The estimated useful life for these
assets was extended from three years to four years in order to
recognize depreciation expense over the remaining time that the
assets are expected to be in service. The change was based on an
analysis performed by DoubleClicks operations department.
As a result of this change, net loss was reduced by
approximately $83million, or $006 per basic and diluted
share, for the year ended December31, 2002. 61 DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

CSC, a data management company based in
Schaumburg, Illinois. This acquisition enabled DoubleClick to
strengthen the link between its email, campaign management and
Web site analytics technology businesses with its data

its acquisition of MessageMedia, Inc.
MessageMedia, a provider of permission-based email
marketing and messaging solutions. The acquisition of
MessageMedia has allowed DoubleClick to expand its suite of
email product and service offerings as well as broaden its
client base. DoubleClick acquired all the outstanding shares,
options and warrants of MessageMedia in exchange for
approximately one million shares of DoubleClick common stock
valued at approximately $75million and stock options and
warrants to acquire DoubleClick common stock valued at
approximately $02 million. In connection with the acquisition,
DoubleClick loaned $20million to MessageMedia to satisfy
MessageMedias operating requirements. The loan was
extinguished upon the closing of the acquisition and included as
a component of the purchase price. The purchase price, inclusive
of approximately $16million of direct acquisition costs,
was approximately $113million. The value of the
approximately one million shares of DoubleClick common stock
issued was determined based on the average market price of
DoubleClick common stock, as quoted on the Nasdaq National
Market, for the day immediately prior to, the day of, and the

STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2003 Divestitures European Media Business On January28, 2002, DoubleClick completed
the sale of its European Media business to AdLINK Internet Media
AG AdLINK, a German provider of Internet
advertising solutions, in exchange for $263million and
the assumption by AdLINK of liabilities associated with
DoubleClicks European Media business. Intercompany
liabilities in an amount equal to $43million were settled
through a cash payment by AdLINK to DoubleClick at the closing
of the transaction. Following the closing of the transaction
described above, United Internet AG United
Internet, AdLINKs largest shareholder, exercised
its right to sell to DoubleClick 15% of the outstanding common
shares of AdLINK in exchange for $306million. Pursuant to
its agreement with United Internet, the exercise of this right
caused DoubleClicks option to acquire an additional 21% of
AdLINK common shares for United Internet to vest. This option is
only exercisable if AdLINK has achieved EBITDA-positive results
for the fiscal quarters ending December31, 2003 and
March31, 2004. EBITDA, as defined in the option agreement,
is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization,
and one-time charges, such as restructuring costs, mergers and
acquisition related costs, and other extraordinary items,
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States. Should AdLINK fail to achieve
these results, the option will expire unexercisable as of
December31, 2003 or March31, 2004, as applicable.
AdLINKs results for three months ended December31,
2003 were not publicly available as of the date of this filing. As a result of the transactions described above,
DoubleClick sold its European Media business and received a 15%
interest in AdLINK, which represented approximately
39million shares valued at approximately
$83million. DoubleClicks option to acquire an
additional 21% of the outstanding common shares of AdLINK for
United Internet also vested. DoubleClick received
$20million as partial reimbursement for its cash outlays
related to the acquisitions of, and payments with respect to,
the minority interests in certain of its European subsidiaries
pursuant to its agreement to sell its European Media business.
DoubleClicks investment in AdLINK is included in
Investments in affiliates in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Revenue recognized from services provided to
AdLINK were approximately $27million and
$20million during the years ended December31, 2003
and 2002, respectively. North American Media Business On July10, 2002, DoubleClick sold its North
American Media business to L90, Inc., which was renamed
MaxWorldwide, Inc. MaxWorldwide, in exchange for
48million shares in MaxWorldwide and $50million in
cash. The 48million shares represented 161% of
outstanding MaxWorldwide common stock and were valued at
approximately $31million. Pursuant to the merger
agreement, DoubleClick has the right to receive an additional
$60million if, prior to July 10, 2005, MaxWorldwide
achieves EBITDA-positive results for two out of three
consecutive quarters. EBITDA, as defined in the merger
agreement, is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, excluding certain non-recurring items. During the
three months ended September30, 2002, December31,
2002, March31, 2003, and June30, 2003, and the one
month ended July31, 2003, MaxWorldwide did not achieve
EBITDA-positive results. DoubleClick accounts for this
investment under the equity method of accounting and reports its
share of MaxWorldwides results on a 90-day lag. The
investment is included in Investment in affiliates
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On August13, 2002, MaxWorldwide repurchased
5,596,972 shares of its common stock. As a result of this
repurchase, DoubleClicks ownership percentage increased to
198%. As of August1, 2003, MaxWorldwide has
adopted the liquidation basis of accounting and therefore will
not be reporting a statement of operations for periods
subsequent to July31, 2003. On July22, 2003 65 DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2003 MaxWorldwide stockholders approved a proposal to
adopt a plan of liquidation and dissolution, pursuant to which
it would dissolve and liquidate MaxWorldwide and its
subsidiaries. On July31, 2003, MaxWorldwide completed the
sale of its MaxOnline division and the plan of liquidation and
dissolution became effective. As a result of these events it is
unlikely that MaxWorldwide will achieve the financial milestones
that would trigger DoubleClicks right to receive the
$60million in contingent cash consideration discussed
above. In its quarterly report on Form10-Q for the quarter
ended September30, 2003, MaxWorldwide reported net assets
in liquidation of approximately $257million. See
Note19 Subsequent Events. DoubleClick recognized revenue of approximately
$22million and $21 million during the years ended
December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, relating to
services provided to MaxWorldwide. plan On May6, 2002, DoubleClick sold its @plan

NetRatings, a provider of technology-driven
Internet audience information solutions for media and commerce,
in exchange for $120million in cash and 505,739 shares of
NetRatings common stock valued at approximately
$61million. DoubleClick sold the NetRatings shares in the
fourth quarter of 2002 and the first quarter of 2003. The following unaudited pro forma results of

NOTE 3 DoubleClick Japan In July 2000, DoubleClick contributed its wholly
owned subsidiary, NetGravity Japan, to its affiliate DoubleClick
Japan in return for an additional 27% ownership interest in
DoubleClick Japan. In addition to increasing DoubleClicks
equity interest to approximately 37%, the agreement with
DoubleClick Japan enabled it to elect a majority of the seats on
DoubleClick Japans board of directors and exercise a
controlling financial interest in its operations. Accordingly,
DoubleClick consolidated the net assets and results of
operations of DoubleClick Japan as of the date of the transfer. Subsequent to the transfer of NetGravity Japan
described above, DoubleClick made an additional investment of
$54million in DoubleClick Japan, which increased its
interest to approximately 43%. On April25, 2001, DoubleClick Japan
completed its initial public offering of common stock, which
shares are now traded on the Osaka Stock Exchange. As a result
of this offering, DoubleClicks ownership interest in
DoubleClick Japan decreased from approximately 43% to 382% and
DoubleClick recognized a gain of approximately
$72million. This gain has been included in Gain on
equity transactions of affiliates, net in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations. 66 DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2003 On December26, 2002, DoubleClick sold
45,049 shares of common stock in DoubleClick Japan and received
proceeds of $143million, reducing its ownership interest
from 382% to 156%. As a result of this transaction,
DoubleClick accounts for its remaining 31,271 shares in
DoubleClick Japan under the equity method of accounting.
DoubleClick also retains one seat on DoubleClick Japans
board of directors. DoubleClicks investment in DoubleClick
Japan is included in Investment in affiliates in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Revenue recognized through services provided to
DoubleClick Japan was approximately $32million during the
year ended December31, 2003.   
NOTE4
Investment in ValueClick Inc. Effective February28, 2000, DoubleClick
acquired an approximately 33% interest in ValueClick, Inc.
ValueClick as well as a warrant to purchase
ValueClick common stock for 732,860 shares of DoubleClick common
stock and $100million in cash. DoubleClicks
investment in ValueClick was recorded based on the fair value of
the consideration paid approximately $942million less
approximately $277million of treasury stock that
represented the proportionate share of the DoubleClick stock
held by ValueClick. In addition to approximately
$413million of goodwill, DoubleClicks investment in
ValueClick also included an amount of approximately
$187million which represented the estimated fair value of
the warrant on February28, 2000. DoubleClick subsequently
wrote-off the entire value of the warrant in the third quarter
of 2000 due to managements determination of its
unrealizable future value. As a result of the effect of the
initial public offering in the first quarter of 2000
DoubleClicks ownership interest in ValueClick decreased
from 33% to 281%. DoubleClicks investment in ValueClick
through December31, 2001, was accounted for under the
equity method, with a 90-day lag in reporting DoubleClicks
share of the results of ValueClick. In the first quarter of 2001, DoubleClick
recorded the effects of ValueClicks issuance of
approximately 57million shares to complete a purchase
acquisition of Bach Systems, Inc. Bach Systems and
to consummate a pooling of interests merger with
ClickAgents.com, Inc. ClickAgents. DoubleClick
treated ValueClicks pooling with ClickAgents as a book
value purchase of ClickAgents by ValueClick. As a result of
these transactions, DoubleClicks ownership interest was
reduced from 281% to 235% and the value of its proportionate
share of ValueClicks net assets decreased. DoubleClick
recorded a decrease in the value of its investment in ValueClick
of $38million, reduced the carrying value of treasury
stock to approximately $153million and recognized a loss
of approximately $38million. This loss has been included
in Gain on equity transactions of affiliates, net in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the second quarter of 2001, DoubleClick
recorded the effects of ValueClicks issuance of
approximately 27million shares to complete its pooling of
interest merger with Z Media, Inc. As a result of the merger,
DoubleClicks ownership interest in ValueClick was reduced
from 235% to 217% and the value of its proportionate share of
ValueClicks net assets decreased. Pursuant to its
accounting policy, DoubleClick recorded a decrease in the value
of its investment in ValueClick of $18million, reduced
the carrying amount of treasury stock to $142million and
recognized a loss of approximately $15million. This loss
has been included in Gain on equity transactions of
affiliates, net in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. In the second quarter of 2001, ValueClick sold
the remaining 567,860shares of DoubleClick common stock it
owned to third parties. DoubleClick recorded an increase in the
value of its investment in ValueClick of approximately
$15million, which was equal to its proportionate share of
the cash proceeds from the sale. Also as a result of this
transaction, DoubleClick reduced the carrying amount of treasury
stock to zero and recognized a charge to retained earnings of
approximately $127million, which represented the
difference between the treasury shares original basis and
the cash proceeds from the sale. 67 DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2003 In response to the prolonged downturn of the
economy in general, and the continued weakness in aggregate
online advertising spending in particular, DoubleClick undertook
a review of the recoverability of certain of its investments in
the third quarter of 2001. Noting the continued fall in the
price of ValueClick stock, management determined that its
investment in ValueClick was impaired. Consequently, DoubleClick
wrote down its investment in ValueClick and recognized an
impairment charge of approximately $117million, which
represented the difference between DoubleClicks carrying
value and the estimated fair value of its investment in
ValueClick. The estimated fair value of DoubleClicks
investment in ValueClick was determined based on the closing
market price of ValueClick stock on September30, 2001.
This charge has been included in Impairment of investments
in affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the fourth quarter of 2001, DoubleClick
recorded the effects of ValueClicks issuance of
approximately 06million shares to the former shareholders
of Bach Systems upon the achievement of certain performance
objectives. As a result of this issuance, DoubleClicks
ownership interest was reduced from 217% to 213% and the value
of its proportionate share of ValueClicks net assets
decreased. DoubleClick recorded a decrease in the value of its
investment in ValueClick of $03million and recognized a
loss of approximately $03million. This loss has been
included in Gain on equity transactions of
affiliates, net in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Also in the fourth quarter of 2001, DoubleClick
recorded the effects of ValueClicks issuance of
approximately 149million shares to complete its purchase
acquisition of Mediaplex, Inc. As a result of the merger,
DoubleClicks ownership interest was reduced from 213% to
152% and the value of its proportionate share of
ValueClicks net assets decreased. DoubleClick recorded a
decrease in the value of its investment in ValueClick of
$01million and recognized a loss of approximately
$01million. This loss has been included in Gain on
equity transactions of affiliates, net in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations. For the year ended December31, 2001,
DoubleClick recognized approximately $07million of
goodwill amortization associated with its investment in
ValueClick. As a result of the cumulative dilutive effects of
the transactions described above, DoubleClick did not believe
that it was able to exercise significant influence over its
investment in ValueClick as of December31, 2001.
Accordingly, DoubleClick no longer recorded its proportionate
share of ValueClicks results but instead carried this
investment at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net
of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders
equity. DoubleClicks investment in ValueClick is included
in Investment in affiliates in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. In the fourth quarter of 2002 DoubleClick entered
into a repurchase agreement with ValueClick whereby ValueClick
repurchased all of DoubleClicks remaining 79million
shares for $213million or approximately $270 per share.
DoubleClick recognized a gain of $47million from the sale
of the investment, which has been included in Gain on sale
of investments in affiliates on the Consolidated
Statements of Operations. 68 DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

During the first quarter of 2003, DoubleClick
sold its remaining investment in NetRatings and received
proceeds of approximately $06million. The gain recognized
on the sale of this investment was not material. In the third quarter of 2002, DoubleClick
determined that the carrying value of certain of its
investments, principally its cost-method investments in AdLINK
and NetRatings and its equity-method investment in MaxWorldwide
were impaired based on the continued decline in the fair market
value of these investments. As a result, DoubleClick recorded an
impairment charge of $117million, which represented the
difference between DoubleClicks carrying value and the
estimated fair value of these investments. The estimated fair
values of DoubleClicks investments in AdLINK, NetRatings
and MaxWorldwide, were determined based on the closing market
price of their stock on September30, 2002. Additionally,
it was determined that DoubleClick Asia, a joint venture and a
cost method investment, would be liquidated and therefore had no
continuing value. As a consequence, DoubleClick wrote-off its
entire investment in DoubleClick Asia and recognized an
impairment charge of $24million. These charges have been included in
Impairment of investments in affiliates on the

$04million in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively.   
NOTE8
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets The persistence of unfavorable economic
conditions led DoubleClick to undertake a review of the
recoverability of certain of its investments in the third
quarter of 2001. As a result of significantly lower than
expected revenues generated at that time and considerably
reduced estimates of future performance, DoubleClick concluded
that its investments in @plan.inc @plan and
Flashbase, Inc. Flashbase were impaired.
Accordingly, DoubleClick recognized an approximately
$633million impairment charge equal to the difference
between its investments in and the estimated fair value of these
entities in the third quarter of 2001. Of this amount,
approximately $533million related to @plan and
$100million related to Flashbase. The amount of the goodwill impairment was
calculated based on discounted analyses of these entities
expected future cash flows, which were no longer deemed adequate
to support the value of the goodwill associated with these
investments. In both cases, sharply reduced estimates of
anticipated revenue growth and operating results, triggered
primarily by the continued softness in aggregate online
advertising spending, generated correspondingly lowered
expectations of future cash flows and formed the basis for the
recording of the charge in the third quarter of 2001. These businesses expected future cash flows
and terminal values were based on DoubleClicks budgeted
forecasts and estimates. In its calculation to determine the
impairment charge for its investment in @plan, DoubleClick used
a discount rate of 15% and assumed a remaining useful life of
25years, which represented the remaining useful life of
the goodwill associated with this investment. In its calculation
to determine the impairment charge for Flashbase, DoubleClick
used a discount rate of 15% and a useful life of
175years, which represented the remaining useful life of
the goodwill associated with this investment. In connection with DoubleClicks decision to
sell its European Media operations, DoubleClick determined in
the fourth quarter of 2001 that the estimated fair value of the
consideration it would receive pursuant to the sale would be
less than the carrying value of its European Media operations.
As a result, DoubleClick concluded that its investment in its
European Media operations was impaired. DoubleClick recorded a
charge of approximately $88million in the fourth quarter
of 2001, which represented the difference between the estimated
fair value of the consideration to be received and the carrying
value of the net assets to be sold. In 2002, based on the prolonged softness in the
economy and the then current and projected operational
performance of DoubleClicks email reporting unit,
DoubleClick initiated a third-party valuation of its email
reporting unit to determine whether the recorded balance of
goodwill related to this reporting unit was recoverable. The
outcome of this valuation resulted in an impairment charge of
approximately $438million being recorded during the third
quarter of 2002. The fair market value of the email reporting
unit was determined based on revenue projections, then recent
transactions involving similar businesses and the price/revenue
multiples at which they were bought and sold and the then
price/revenue multiples of our competitors in the email
marketplace. In addition, DoubleClick determined that the fair
value of certain intangible assets was considered impaired.
DoubleClick recorded an impairment charge of $33million
based on the difference between the carrying value and estimated
fair value of certain intangible assets also associated with the
email reporting unit. There were no such charges in 2003 based upon the
results of DoubleClicks annual goodwill impairment test. 71 DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Subordinated Debt Convertible Subordinated Debt
Zero Coupon On June23, 2003, DoubleClick issued
$1350million aggregate principal amount of Zero Coupon
Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2023 the Zero Coupon
Notes in a private offering. The Zero Coupon Notes do not
bear interest and have a zero yield to maturity. The Zero Coupon
Notes are convertible under certain circumstances into
DoubleClick common stock at a conversion price of approximately
$1312 per share, which would result in an aggregate of
approximately 103million shares, subject to adjustment
upon the occurrence of specified events. Each $1,000 principal
amount of the Zero Coupon Notes will initially be convertible
into 762311 shares of DoubleClick common stock prior to
July15, 2023 if the sale price of DoubleClicks
common stock issuable upon conversion of the Zero Coupon Notes
reaches a specified threshold for a defined period of time, if
specified corporate transactions have occurred or if DoubleClick
calls the Zero Coupon Notes for redemption. The specified
thresholds for conversion prior to the maturity date are
aduring any calendar quarter, the last reported sale
price of DoubleClicks common stock for at least 20 trading
days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last
trading day of the previous calendar quarter is greater than or
equal to 120% of the applicable conversion price on that 30th
trading day and bsubject to certain exceptions, during
the five business day period following any five consecutive
trading day period, the trading price per $1,000 principal
amount of Zero Coupon Notes for each of the five consecutive
trading days is less than 98% of the product of the last
reported sale price of DoubleClicks common stock and the
conversion rate initially 762311 on each such day. As of
December31, 2003, these thresholds have not been met. The Zero Coupon Notes are DoubleClicks
general unsecured obligations and are subordinated in right of
payment to all of its existing and future senior debt.
DoubleClick may not redeem the Zero Coupon Notes prior to
July15, 2008. DoubleClick may be required to repurchase
any or all of the Zero Coupon Notes upon a change of control or
a termination of trading. DoubleClick may redeem for cash some
or all of the Zero Coupon Notes at any time on or after
July15, 2008. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes also have
the right to require DoubleClick to purchase some or all of
their notes for cash on July15, 2008, July15, 2013
and July15, 2018, at a price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes being redeemed plus
accrued and unpaid liquidated damages, if any. 72 DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2003 DoubleClick received net proceeds of
approximately $1315million and incurred issuance costs of
approximately $35million. The issuance costs will be
amortized from the date of issuance through July15, 2008
and are included as a component of Other assets on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Zero Coupon Notes contain an embedded
derivative, the value of which as of December31, 2003 has
been determined by a third party valuation to be immaterial to
our consolidated financial position. For financial accounting
purposes, the ability of the holder to convert upon the
satisfaction of a trading price condition constitutes an
embedded derivative. Any changes in its value will be reflected
in our future income statements, in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Convertible Subordinated Debt
475% Coupon On March17, 1999, DoubleClick issued 475%
Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 the 475%
Convertible Notes with a principal amount of
$250million. The 475% Convertible Notes were convertible
into DoubleClick common stock at a conversion price of $4125
per share, subject to adjustment at the occurrence of certain
events and at the holders option. Interest on the 475%
Convertible Notes was payable semiannually on March15 and
September15 of each year. Interest expense relating to the 475%
Convertible Notes was approximately $54million 103million and $116million for the years ended
December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In 2001, DoubleClick repurchased approximately
$303million of its outstanding 475% Convertible Notes
for approximately $219million in cash. DoubleClick wrote
off approximately $02million in deferred issuance costs
and recognized a gain of approximately $82million. In the third quarter of 2002, DoubleClick
repurchased $649million of its outstanding 475%
Convertible Notes for approximately $536million in cash,
inclusive of $12million of accrued interest. DoubleClick
wrote off approximately $07million in deferred issuance
costs and recognized a gain of approximately $119million. On June24, 2003, DoubleClick called for
redemption the remaining $1548million outstanding
aggregate principal amount of 475% Convertible Notes. On
July24, 2003, DoubleClick redeemed these notes at a
redemption price equal to 102036% of the aggregate principal
approximately $1580million plus accrued and unpaid
interest. The proceeds from the sale of the Zero Coupon Notes
due 2023, together with existing cash, were used towards this
redemption. As a result of the redemption, DoubleClick recorded
a loss of approximately $44million associated with the
redemption premium and write-off of deferred issuance costs
during 2003. NOTE 11 Stockholders

NOTE12
Non-Cash Compensation Non-cash compensation primarily represents the
consideration paid to certain former shareholders of DoubleClick
Scandinavia AB DoubleClick Scandinavia. Shares of
DoubleClick common stock were issued based upon the continued
employment of the former shareholders and the attainment of
specific revenue objectives for the year ended December31,
2001. In May 2001, DoubleClick agreed to pay the former
shareholders the minimum consideration they were entitled to
receive for the 2001 fiscal year under the terms of the original
agreement. As a result, DoubleClick recognized approximately
$152million in non-cash compensation expense, which
represented the remaining unaccrued portion of this accelerated
payment in 2001.   
NOTE13
Restructuring 2001 Restructuring Throughout 2001, DoubleClick took certain actions
to increase operational efficiencies and bring costs in line
with revenues. These measures included the involuntary
terminations of approximately 605employees, primarily from
its Media and TechSolutions divisions, as well as the
consolidation of some of their leased office space and the
closure of several of their offices. As a consequence, we
recorded an $842million charge to operations during the
year of 2001. This charge included approximately
$104million for severance-related payments to terminated
employees, approximately $517million for the accrual of
future lease costs net of estimated sublease income and
deferred rent liabilities previously recorded, approximately
$195million for the write-off of fixed assets situated in
office locations that were closed or consolidated, and
approximately $26million in other exit costs, which
included consulting and professional fees related to the
restructuring activities and expenses associated with the
decision to move the TechSolutions customer support department
from New York to Colorado. These fixed asset impairments arose
primarily from the write-off of the carrying values of leasehold
improvements in offices in New York, San Francisco and London
that were abandoned as part of the restructuring activities. 2002 Restructuring During 2002, DoubleClick took additional steps to
realign its sales, development and administrative organization
and reduce corporate overhead to position itself for profitable
growth in the future consistent with its long-term objectives.
This involved the involuntary termination of approximately
250employees, primarily from its TechSolutions division,
as well as charges for excess real estate space and the closure
of several offices. As a consequence, DoubleClick recorded a
charge of $984million to operations during the year, of 76 DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2003 which $940million and $44million
have been classified in operating expenses and cost of revenue,
respectively. The charge primarily related to the accrual of
future lease costs net of estimated sublease income and
deferred rent liabilities previously accrued of approximately
$770million, the write-off of fixed assets situated in
closed or abandoned offices of approximately $157million
and payments for severance of approximately $57million.
The accrual for future lease costs and the write-off of fixed
assets were primarily related to its New York office. These
charges were driven by the abandonment of additional space,
reductions in the estimates of future sublease income, as well
as the lengthening of the time required to find a sublease
tenant. In addition, DoubleClick decided to move its data center
operations from New York to its Thornton, Colorado facility. As
a result, DoubleClick recorded a charge of $44million to
cost of revenue relating to the write-off of related fixed
assets. As of December31, 2002, approximately
$361million and $710million remained accrued in
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and
Other long-term liabilities, respectively. 2003 Restructuring In the second quarter of 2003, DoubleClick
recorded a net restructuring credit of $69million, which
related to real estate items. This credit resulted from a
$143million reversal of a portion of the reserve relating
to DoubleClicks New York headquarters, partially offset by
$74million in additional charges primarily relating to
DoubleClicks facilities in San Francisco and London. The
reversal of the reserve was the result of final lease
terminations with respect to DoubleClicks New York
headquarters for which the reserve was in excess of expected
payments. During the third quarter of 2003, DoubleClick
recorded a net restructuring credit of $22million. This
resulted from a net credit from its New York headquarters of
approximately $15million and the termination of the
remainder of DoubleClicks lease in San Francisco, which
resulted in a credit of approximately $07million. The net
credit associated with DoubleClicks New York headquarters
consisted of certain exit costs of $25million partially
offset by the reversal of a deferred rent liability of
approximately $15million, all of which were required to
be recorded in the third quarter in accordance with SFAS
No146. In addition, approximately $25million of
reserves were reversed as the result of favorable settlements of
other real estate related items relating to DoubleClicks
New York headquarters which occurred during the third quarter.
The net credit associated with DoubleClicks San Francisco
facility resulted from the estimated restructuring reserve for
this facility being in excess of the actual payments made in
connection with the lease termination. Total costs to terminate the lease associated
with DoubleClicks previous New York headquarters and San
Francisco facility were approximately $445million and
$264million, respectively, inclusive of broker
commissions and related costs. The remaining restructuring
accrual at December31, 2003 consists of approximately
$82million of payments to be made pursuant to the
termination agreement in connection with DoubleClicks
previous New York headquarters and $248million relating
to other facilities, primarily Louisville, Colorado and London,
England. The accrual associated with these other facilities
represents the excess of future lease commitments over estimated
sublease income, if any. These accruals were based on an
analysis performed with the assistance of a real estate firm and
are based on the current real estate market conditions in the
local markets where these facilities are located. Should market
conditions or other circumstances change, this information may
be updated and additional charges or credits may be required. As of December31, 2003, approximately
$120million and $210million remained accrued in
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and
Other long-term liabilities, respectively. These
amounts are inclusive of $136million of other real estate
reserves, which were reclassed into this accrual during the
third quarter of 2003. These reserves were primarily recorded in
connection with certain business combinations that were
consummated in prior periods. 77 DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

For the year ended December31, 2003,
DoubleClick recorded a valuation allowance against those net
deferred tax assets that DoubleClick believes, after considering
all the available objective evidence, both positive and
negative, historical and prospective, with greater weight given
to historical evidence, are not more likely than not expected to
be realized. At December31, 2003, DoubleClick had
domestic and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $5776million. The federal net operating
loss carryforward was $5228million. Approximately
$3349million of these net operating loss carryforwards
relate to the exercise of employee stock options and any tax
benefit derived therefrom, when realized, will be accounted for
as a credit to additional paid-in-capital rather than a
reduction to the income tax provision. Approximately
$574million of net operating loss carryforwards were
acquired in various corporate acquisitions and any tax benefit
derived therefrom, when realized, will be accounted for as a
credit to goodwill or other acquired intangible assets rather
than a reduction to the income tax provision. In addition,
DoubleClick had $431million of capital loss carryforwards
and $47million of tax credit carryforwards. The federal
net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards expire
in various years beginning in 2012, while the capital loss
carryforwards expire in various years beginning in 2006. The
utilization of a portion of the net operating loss, capital
loss, and research tax credit carryforwards may be subject to
limitation under U.S. federal income tax laws. NOTE 15 Additional Financial

401k of the Internal Revenue Code. Participating employees may
contribute a percentage of their salary to the plan. Employee
contributions are invested at the direction of the employee in

2003, DoubleClick has recorded restructuring reserves totaling
approximately $330million relating to excess and
abandoned space at certain facilities. Such amounts are included
in the table above. 81 DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2003 In addition, DoubleClick had outstanding standby
letters of credit of approximately $173million at
December31, 2003. These letters of credit collateralize
DoubleClicks obligations to third parties under certain
operating leases. Legal In April 2002, a consolidated amended class
action complaint alleging violation of the federal securities
laws in connection with DoubleClicks follow-on offerings
was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York naming as defendants DoubleClick, some of
its officers and directors and certain underwriters of
DoubleClicks follow-on offerings. In October 2002, the
action was dismissed against the named officers and directors
without prejudice. However, claims against DoubleClick remain.
In July 2002, DoubleClick and the other issuers in the
consolidated cases filed motions to dismiss the amended
complaint for failure to state a claim, which was denied as to
DoubleClick in February 2003. In June 2003, DoubleClicks Board of
Directors conditionally approved a proposed partial settlement
with the plaintiffs in this matter. The settlement would
provide, among other things, a release of DoubleClick and of the
individual defendants for the conduct alleged in the action to
be wrongful in the amended complaint. DoubleClick would agree to
undertake other responsibilities under the partial settlement,
including agreeing to assign away, not assert, or release
certain potential claims it may have against its underwriters.
The Board agreed to approve the settlement subject to a number
of conditions, including the participation of a substantial
number of other issuer defendants in the proposed settlement,
the consent of our insurers to the settlement, and the
completion of acceptable final settlement documentation.
Furthermore, the settlement is subject to a hearing on fairness
and approval by the Court overseeing the IPO litigations. If
this settlement is not finalized, DoubleClick intends to dispute
these allegations and defend this lawsuit vigorously. In December 2003, an arbitration panel in Sweden
issued a decision dismissing all claims brought by a former
shareholder of DoubleClick ScandinaviaAB. The shareholder
claimed that DoubleClick breached its obligation to issue and
register shares of DoubleClicks common stock, which the
shareholder claimed caused it to incur damages. The arbitration
hearing took place in November 2003. DoubleClick is defending two class action
lawsuits, one filed in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania and the
other in San Joaquin County, California, alleging, among other
things, deceptive business practices, fraud, misrepresentation,
invasion of privacy and right of association relating to
allegedly deceptive content of online advertisement that
plaintiffs assert we delivered to consumers. The actions seek,
among other things, injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive
damages and attorneys fees and costs. DoubleClick believes
these claims are without merit and intends to defend these
actions vigorously. In October 2003, DoubleClick received a grand
jury subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office for
the Southern District of New York
U.S.Attorneys Office seeking documents
regarding certain vendors that provided services to DoubleClick
during the period from 1999 through 2001. The services provided
by these vendors are unrelated to the products and services
provided by DoubleClick to its customers. DoubleClick is fully
cooperating with the U.S.Attorneys Office. In
addition, DoubleClick conducted an internal investigation and
has implemented remedial measures to improve its selection, use
and oversight of its vendors. DoubleClick does not believe that
any overpayments made by it or other inappropriate payments, if
any, relating to these vendors are material with respect to its
financial statements for the periods in question or its current
financial condition. NOTE18 Segment
Reporting DoubleClick is organized into two segments:
TechSolutions and Data. During 2002, through a series of
transactions, DoubleClick divested of its media businesses and
no longer reports a DoubleClick Media 82 DOUBLECLICK INC. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2003 segment. In December 2003, DoubleClick changed
its measure of segment profit or loss from gross profit to
operating income loss. As a result, DoubleClick has adjusted
its prior period segment disclosures to conform to this new
measurement. Adjustments to reconcile segment reporting to
consolidated results are included in corporate and
intersegment elimination. Corporate represents the
results of operations of DoubleClicks unallocated
corporate overhead and restructuring charges credits that are
non-segment specific. The accounting policies of DoubleClicks
segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies. Intersegment revenues, which
relate primarily to DART for Publishers and Data transfer fees
and the research consulting fees charged by @plan, were valued
at approximately the same rates charged to external customers.
TechSolutions and Data recognize DART for Publishers and Data
transfer fees as revenue, respectively, and as costs of revenue
by DoubleClicks other business segments. Correspondingly,
these transfer fees have no net impact on the determination of
consolidated net revenue or operating income loss. All such
intersegment amounts are eliminated in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations. Revenues and operating income loss by segment

NOTE19 Subsequent
Events In January 2004, DoubleClick commenced operations
of Abacus Deutschland, a joint venture with AZ Direct GmbH, a
subsidiary of Bertelsmann AG, a global media company. This joint
venture, of which DoubleClick has a 50% interest, required an
initial investment by DoubleClick of approximately
$05million and is expected to require additional
investments of $10million during 2004. Abacus Deutschland
is based in Dsseldorf, Germany and offers German catalog
companies modeling tools that can improve their direct marketing
initiatives. On March2, 2004, DoubleClick agreed to
acquire SmartPath, Inc., a privately-held marketing resource
management MRM software company, for approximately
$240million in cash. SmartPaths solutions are

Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as
defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange
Act as of December31, 2003. Based on this evaluation, our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded
that, as of December31, 2003, our disclosure controls and
procedures were 1designed to ensure that material
information relating to us, including our consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known to our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer by others within those entities,
particularly during the period in which this report was being
prepared and 2effective, in that they provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. No change in our internal control over financial
reporting as defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f
under the Exchange Act occurred during the fiscal quarter ended
December31, 2003 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. PART III
