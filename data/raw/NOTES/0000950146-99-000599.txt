Board of Directors and Stockholders
Schein Pharmaceutical, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Schein
Pharmaceutical, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 27, 1997 and December 26,
1998, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders'
equity, comprehensive income loss and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 26, 1998. These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the management of Schein Pharmaceutical, Inc. and
subsidiaries. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Schein
Pharmaceutical, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 27, 1997 and December 26,
1998, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 1998 in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. s/ BDO Seidman, LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company and Principles of Consolidation
Schein Pharmaceutical, Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company are engaged in
developing, manufacturing, marketing and distributing generic pharmaceutical
products and a line of specialty branded pharmaceutical products. The Company
sells to drug store chains, retail pharmacies, dialysis chains, managed care
organizations, hospitals and other institutions, both through drug wholesalers
and directly, primarily in the United States. The Company operates in one
segment.
On April 9, 1998, the Company consummated an initial public offering of common
stock. In anticipation of the offering, the Company effected a 105-for-one stock
split, and increased its authorized common stock to 100,000,000 shares. All
applicable share and per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock
split.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Investments in unconsolidated affiliated
companies are accounted for using the equity method. All material intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation. Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities including
restructuring reserves and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Fiscal Year
The Company reports its operations on a 52-53 week basis ending on the last
Saturday of December. All of the years presented in these statements include 52
weeks. Revenue Recognition
Revenues are recognized when products are shipped. Provisions for estimated
sales allowances, returns and losses are accrued at the time revenues are
recognized. Research and Development Expenditures
Expenditures for research and development are expensed as incurred.                    42          SCHEIN PHARMACEUTICAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for its stock option awards to employees under the
intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under the
intrinsic value based method, compensation cost is the excess, if any, of the
quoted market price of the stock at grant date or other measurement date over
the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. The Company provides pro
forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value
based method of accounting had been applied as required by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. Computation of Earnings Per Common Share
Basic earnings per share has been computed using the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per share includes the
assumed exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method that could
potentially dilute earnings per share. In all periods presented, there were no
differences between basic and diluted income loss per common share because the
assumed exercise of stock options was anti-dilutive. The assumed exercise of
stock options could potentially dilute basic earnings per share amounts in the
future. Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments and other short-term
investments with an initial maturity date of three months or less from purchase
date to be cash equivalents. Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the
first-in, first-out method. Property, Plant, Equipment, Depreciation and Amortization
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization
are computed primarily under the straight-line method over estimated useful
lives. Amortization of capital leases is computed using the straight-line method
over the lease term.
Product Rights, Licenses, Regulatory Approvals and Goodwill
Product rights, licenses and regulatory approvals are amortized primarily on a
straight-line basis over the expected profitable and useful lives of the
underlying products and manufacturing facilities, generally for periods ranging
from 10 to 15 years. Goodwill was being amortized over 25 years on a
straight-line basis. Due to an impairment loss, the remaining net book value of
goodwill was written off in the third quarter of 1998 see Note 17. Deferred Loan Fees
Costs incurred in connection with debt agreements are capitalized and included
in other assets and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest
method over the expected term of the related debt.                    43          SCHEIN PHARMACEUTICAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Investments in Marketable Securities
The Company available-for-sale marketable securities are carried at fair
market value and are included in other assets in the accompanying balance
sheets. Unrealized gains are recorded directly to stockholders' equity, net of
applicable income taxes. The Company uses the specific identification method of
determining cost in calculating related gains and losses. The Company does not
own held-to-maturity or trading securities.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, such as goodwill and property and equipment, are evaluated
for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated
undiscounted future cash flows from the use of these assets. When such
impairment exists, the related assets will be written down to fair value. In
connection with the Food and Drug Administration consent agreement, the Company
determined that certain long-lived assets were impaired see Note 17.
Taxes on Income
The Company accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability approach.
Accordingly, deferred taxes on income are provided for those items for which the
reporting period and methods for income tax purposes differ from those used for
financial statement purposes using the asset and liability method. Deferred
income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences
by applying enacted statutory rates applicable to future years to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing
assets and liabilities.
Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
approximate fair value because of the current nature of these instruments. The
carrying amounts reported for revolving credit and long-term debt approximate
fair value because the interest rates on these instruments are subject to
changes with market interest rates.
In order to manage interest rate exposure, the Company has entered into interest
rate swap agreements to exchange variable rate debt into fixed rate debt without
the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. Net payments or receipts under
the agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company is potentially subject to a concentration of credit risk with
respect to its trade receivables, the majority of which are due from
wholesalers, drug store chains and distributors. The Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral.
The Company maintains allowances and insurance to cover potential or anticipated
losses for uncollectible accounts.                    44          SCHEIN PHARMACEUTICAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Foreign Currency Translations
Assets and liabilities of international affiliates, which are not material, are
translated at current exchange rates and related translation adjustments are
reported as a component of stockholders' equity. Income statement accounts are
translated at the average rates during the period. Effect of Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities which establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain

Puerto Rico income tax. The 15 year tax grant began in 1996. The grant benefits
are recognized in conjunction with the Company election to compute its U.S.
tax under Internal Revenue Code Section 936 which reduces the tax by an amount
based on the Company operations.
The exercise of stock options resulted in a tax benefit of $09 million in 1998

Revolving Credit and Loan Agreement
In September 1995, the Company entered into a secured revolving credit and term
loan agreement, as amended the credit agreement with a group of banks to
provide funds for an acquisition, the repayment of certain of its debt, working
capital and general corporate purposes. The credit agreement at December 1998
provided a term loan facility of $1009 million and a revolving credit facility
of $1000 million available through December 2001. The borrowings outstanding
under the revolving credit facility were $750 million and $440 million as of
December 26, 1998 and December 27, 1997, respectively. Amounts borrowed under
the revolving credit are classified as current in the accompanying balance
sheets.
Borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest, which is payable at least
quarterly, at a rate equal to the bank floating base rate plus a premium
ranging from 050% to 200%, or at a rate equal to LIBOR plus a premium ranging
from 150% to 300%, depending upon the type of borrowing and the Company
performance against certain leverage and interest expense ratios. The effective
borrowing rate was 771% and 791% at December 26, 1998 and December 27, 1997,
respectively. A commitment fee ranging from 025% to 050% per annum of the
unused daily amount of the total commitment is payable quarterly. Borrowings
under the credit agreement are secured by a mortgage on all real property, liens
on inventory and receivables and a pledge of subsidiaries' stock. The debt is
guaranteed by the Company domestic subsidiaries.
The credit agreement contains limitations and restrictions concerning
investments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt, liens, transactions with
affiliates, dividend payments and borrowings. In addition, the agreement
requires the Company to maintain minimum net worth levels and certain ratios as
defined therein of leverage to EBITDA, working capital and fixed charge
coverage. Amounts available for dividends as permitted by the credit agreement
as of December 26, 1998 were not material. Currently, the Company credit
agreement and its senior floating rate notes contain restrictions on the payment
of dividends. Senior Floating Rate Notes
In December 1997, the Company issued $1000 million of senior floating rate
notes due in 2004, the proceeds of which were used to repay a senior
subordinated loan. Interest on the notes is payable quarterly at a rate per
annum equal to LIBOR plus 30%. The effective borrowing rate was 847% as of
December 26, 1998.                    50          SCHEIN PHARMACEUTICAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued In December 1997, the Company incurred costs of $44 million in connection with
the senior floating rate notes. In April 1998, the Company consummated an
initial public offering and generated net proceeds of $525 million. The
majority of these proceeds were used to retire $500 million of the senior
floating rate notes. This resulted in an extraordinary charge of $17 million,
net of taxes, related to the early extinguishment of debt, which included the
write-off of deferred financing fees as well as costs associated with the
reacquisition of the notes. Excluding the amount treated as an extraordinary
item in 1998, deferred loan fees amortized in 1998, 1997 and 1996 were $19
million, $33 million and $26 million, respectively.
The Company senior floating rate notes are fully and unconditionally
guaranteed jointly and severally by each of the Company domestic wholly-owned
subsidiaries. These subsidiaries sell all of their products to Schein
Pharmaceutical, Inc., the parent company. Summarized financial information for
these wholly-owned subsidiary guarantors using the push-down method of

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued NOTE 10--FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
As of December 26, 1998, the Company had $150 million notional amount interest
rate swaps outstanding. These swaps are used to convert floating rate debt to
fixed rate debt to reduce the Company exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The net result was to substitute a weighted average fixed interest rate of 545%
for the variable LIBOR rate of 559% on the Company debt. The swaps expire in
September 1999 and February 2001.
While the Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by
the counterparties of these contracts, the Company does not anticipate
nonperformance by the counterparties. The Company does not require collateral or
other security to support these financial instruments. NOTE 11--STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Currently the Company has one class of common stock. Prior to the initial public
offering in April 1998, the Company had Class A common shares and Class B common
shares. Each of the two classes of stock were identical except that the Class B
common shares were non-voting. Upon the initial public offering, the Class A
common shares and Class B common shares converted on a one-for-one basis to a
new share of the Company common stock.
In connection with the offering, the Company Board of Directors authorized the
issuance of up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $01 per share. NOTE 12--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Consulting Agreement
The Company has a series of agreements collectively, the Consulting Agreement
with a patent attorney the Consultant. The Consulting Agreement generally
provides that if a challenge based on an opinion of the Consultant results in
either a favorable judicial determination which enables the Company to market a
generic version of the product or in a settlement, the Company will pay the
Consultant one half of the adjusted gross profit as defined from its sales of
the generic versions of the patented product until the date on which the patent
would normally have expired or one half of the proceeds of any settlement.
Under the Consulting Agreement, the Consultant, together with the Company, has
identified certain patents on branded pharmaceutical products susceptible to a
challenge and the Consultant acted as counsel to the Company in those instances
where it decided to proceed with a patent challenge. In 1994, the Company settled two such patent challenges. The first settlement
resulted in a series of cash payments to the Company. Included in net revenues
are settlement revenues of $300 million, $250 million and $125 million in
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Pursuant to the settlement, the Company paid
profit sharing expenses to the Consultant amounting to $150 million, $125
million, and $63 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Such amounts are
included in cost of sales.
The second settlement involved a license grant to the Company to begin
manufacturing and marketing a product which was the subject of the patent
challenge. Sales of such product commenced in 1996. In connection with the
license grant, profit sharing expenses amounted to $44 million, $145 million
and $86 million in fiscal 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Profit sharing
expenses are included in cost of sales.                    52          SCHEIN PHARMACEUTICAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

On March 31, 1998, the Company entered into an agreement with Elan Corporation
Plc covering several products in various stages of development in the areas of
oral sustained-release and transdermal products. Under the agreement and its
amendments, the Company is obligated to pay $150 million in license fees
through March 1999, of which $70 million was paid in 1998, and $80 million was
included in accrued expenses at December 1998. Additionally, the Company may be
obligated to pay approximately $35 million in additional fees as and when
certain milestones are achieved. Certain of these fees may be increased by up to
$20 million or decreased by up to $05 million depending on whether certain
other milestones are achieved.
In 1994, the Company entered into a worldwide technology licensing and
development agreement with a U.K. based pharmaceutical development company for
the development of a portfolio of oral controlled release and transdermal
products. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is obligated to pay
product licensing fees and development costs totaling $320 million, dependent
on achievement of interim milestones. In 1996, the Company incurred obligations
totaling $30 million, consisting of a $05 million licensing fee, which was
capitalized, and $25 million in development costs which were charged to
research and development expense. The Company recognized $23 million in
development expenses in 1997. No amounts were expended in 1998. The remaining
commitment under the agreement as of December 26, 1998 was $122 million,
subject to the completion of milestones.
In 1996, the Company entered into a marketing and distribution agreement with a
corporation to jointly commercialize FerrlecitR. Under the terms of the
agreement, the Company is obligated to pay product licensing fees and
development costs of $120 million, dependent on the achievement of certain
milestones. The Company paid and capitalized $50 million and $20 million of
product license fees in 1998 and 1996, respectively.                    53          SCHEIN PHARMACEUTICAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Litigation
In September and October 1998, following the commencement of a seizure action by
the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA against the Company
Steris Laboratories, Inc. Steris facility on September 10, 1998 see Note 17,
a number of substantially similar complaints were filed in federal court in the
District of New Jersey against the Company, its Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, its Chief Financial Officer and, in certain actions, one or more of the
following: the Company Senior Vice President of Technical Operations, General
Counsel and three underwriters of the Company April 9, 1998 initial public
offering. Plaintiffs purported to sue on behalf of a class of persons who
purchased shares of the Company common stock pursuant or traceable to the
initial public offering and allege that defendants violated the Securities Act
of 1933 by making misrepresentations and omissions of material facts in
connection with the initial public offering and in the registration statement
and prospectus issued pursuant to the initial public offering. In November and
December 1998, groups of plaintiffs seeking appointment as lead plaintiff for a
class filed complaints or amended complaints that added claims under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder on behalf of
purchasers of the Company common stock between April 9, 1998 and September 28,
1998 to the claims described above. Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that
defendants failed to disclose or misrepresented facts concerning the status of
the Company internal controls and ability to comply with government
regulations relating to its manufacturing activities, including the status of
the Company corrective actions at the Steris facility and the effect of the
FDA enforcement action on the Company operations. Plaintiffs on behalf of the
purported class seek damages, recision and/or recisionary damages.
On December 21, 1998, the court entered an order consolidating the actions,
appointing lead plaintiffs and approving selection of lead and liaison counsel.
Defendants have not yet responded to the complaints, pending the filing by lead
plaintiffs of a consolidated amended complaint in the actions. The Company
intends to defend itself vigorously against these actions.
In one of the Company patent challenge litigations filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York, the trial judge ruled against the
Company and upheld the validity of the patent at issue. On October 1, 1998, the
Court awarded attorney fees to the patent holder and its licensee. The Company
has been informed that the fees sought will be approximately $3 million, subject
to final determination by the Court. The Company intends to appeal this
decision.
In addition, the Company is a defendant in several product liability cases.
These cases are typical for a company in the pharmaceutical industry. The
Company also is involved in other proceedings and claims of various types.
Management presently believes that the disposition of all such known product
liability and other proceedings and claims, individually or in the aggregate,
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company financial position,
operations or liquidity.                    54          SCHEIN PHARMACEUTICAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTE 17--CONSENT AGREEMENT AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGE
Food and Drug Administration Consent Agreement
On September 10, 1998, the United States, on behalf of the FDA, based on actions
it filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York on September 9
and in the District of Arizona on September 10, initiated seizures of drugs and
drug related products manufactured by Steris. The actions alleged certain
instances in which the Steris facility was not operating in conformity with
current Good Manufacturing Practices known as cGMP regulations. The actions
resulted in the seizure of all drugs and drug related products in the Company
possession manufactured at the Steris facility and halted the manufacture and
distribution of Steris products.
On or about October 16, 1998, Steris and certain of its officers, without
admitting any allegations of the complaints and disclaiming any liability in
connection therewith, entered into a consent agreement filed in the District of
Arizona to which the New York action had been transferred. Under the terms of
the consent agreement, Steris is required, among other things, to demonstrate
through independent certification that Steris' processes, quality assurance and
quality control programs, and management controls comply with cGMP regulations.
The consent agreement also provides for independent certification of Steris'
management controls, quality assurance and quality control programs, and
employee cGMP training. It further requires that Steris develop a timeline and
Corrective Action Plan for implementing these actions and for expert
certification with respect to matters covered in previous FDA inspections of the
facility. Steris has submitted to the FDA the Corrective Action Plan provided
for under the consent agreement and has begun implementation of that plan.
Steris posted a bond in the amount of $6 million to secure certain obligations
under the consent agreement.
As a result of the consent agreement, Steris has divided its product line into
three categories: products that it will seek to manufacture under expedited
certification procedures under the consent agreement, products that it will seek
to manufacture once it satisfies all conditions under the consent agreement, and
products it currently has decided not to manufacture. Expedited certification
procedures apply for certain products that are particularly important to the
medical community because they are primarily or exclusively available from the
Company or that are particularly significant to the Company.
The Steris facility accounted for approximately 40% of the Company net sales
and 50% of gross profits for the first six months of 1998. The Company resumed
shipments of INFeD, its branded injectable iron product, from existing inventory
on October 30, 1998. Newly manufactured lots of INFeD must undergo certification
by independent experts and review by the FDA prior to commercial distribution.
The Steris products the Company has decided not to manufacture in the near term
contributed approximately $65 million in revenue in the 12-month period ended
June 1998.
During the 30 days following the signing of the consent agreement, Steris
continued and expanded the records review and product-testing program it
initiated earlier in 1998, which includes oversight by independent expert
consultants. Based on the findings of this program to date and other commitments
under the consent agreement, Steris has initiated a number of recalls.
The consent agreement was filed as an exhibit to the Company report on Form
8-K, dated October 27, 1998, and the foregoing description of the consent
agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full and complete
terms of the consent agreement.                    58          SCHEIN PHARMACEUTICAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Restructuring Charge
As a result of the actions taken by the FDA and the consent agreement, the
Company recorded a restructuring charge of $1350 million, net of tax benefit,
in 1998. The details of this restructuring charge are as follows in millions                                 
Costs of restructuring:
Regulatory and compliance related costs.    $  127

Goodwill       955

Total charges and impairments.      1612
Income tax       262
$  1350
Costs of restructuring consist largely of costs incurred at the Steris facility
and, to a lesser extent, costs of closing one of the Company distribution
centers and other steps taken by the Company to reduce its ongoing operating
costs, including workforce reductions. Regulatory and compliance related costs
consist primarily of costs related to products the Company will recondition and
validation testing of products in the market as required by the consent
agreement. Temporary manufacturing shutdown costs are the idle plant costs of
the Steris facility. Severance costs relate to reductions in workforce costs at
the Steris facility, the closed distribution center, and in the institutional
sales and marketing organization. Workforce reductions in 1998 totaled
approximately 370 individuals. Recalls and related expenses and other costs and
expenses are those costs that the Company estimates will be incurred related to
the consent agreement. As of December 26, 1998, $212 million has been charged
against the restructuring reserve of $284 million established in 1998.
The inventory write-off was determined based upon the terms of the consent
agreement that required the Company to destroy certain finished goods and
work-in-process inventories. Additionally, valuation adjustments were recorded
for raw materials and supplies associated with products that the Company no
longer expects to market. Fixed asset impairments were recorded for plant and
equipment at the Steris facility that is not expected to be utilized in
production.                    59          SCHEIN PHARMACEUTICAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
The goodwill impairment was recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be Disposed Of. In 1995, the Company acquired Marsam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Marsam, which like Steris is a manufacturer and marketer of generic injectable
products for the institutional market. The Company subsequently combined the two
organizations' sales and marketing forces with a goal of leveraging the combined
product lines. Additionally, other functions were combined including
manufacturing and research and development activities. As a result of the FDA
consent agreement and the decision not to manufacture a significant number of
Steris products, the Company opportunities in and approach to the
institutional market place was re-evaluated. As part of this re-evaluation,
management reviewed the carrying value of the goodwill. Based upon an evaluation
of projected non-discounted operating cash flows, management determined there
was impairment to goodwill. Fair value was then determined based upon discounted
operating cash flows using a discount rate of 9%. Based on this analysis, the
goodwill amount was written off since it was deemed to have no remaining value.
