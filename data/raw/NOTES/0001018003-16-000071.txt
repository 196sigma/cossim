Ingram Micro Inc. and its subsidiaries operate in NorthAmerica, Europe, Asia-Pacific which includes Middle East and Africa, and LatinAmerica. Note2 Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ingram Micro Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Unless the context otherwise requires, the use of the terms Ingram Micro, we, us and our in these notes to the consolidated financial statements refers to Ingram Micro Inc. and its subsidiaries. Fiscal YearOur fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday nearest to December31. All references herein to 2015, 2014, and 2013 represent the fiscal years ended January2, 201652-weeks, January 3, 2015 53-weeks, and December28, 2013 52-weeks, respectively.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We review our estimates and assumptions on an on-going basis. Significant estimates primarily relate to the realizable value of accounts receivable, vendor programs, inventory, goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. Actual results could differ from these estimates.Change in Accounting PrincipleDuring the fiscal year ended January2, 2016, we adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes Topic 740-Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. Current U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP requires a company to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and non-current amounts in the statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in the statement of financial position. In order to simplify our financial statement presentation, we elected to early adopt this ASU on a prospective basis and have not restated any prior periods. Revenue RecognitionRevenue is recognized when: an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred, including transfer of title and risk of loss for product sales, or services have been rendered for service revenues; the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collection is reasonably assured. Service revenues represented less than 10%of total net sales for 2015, 2014and 2013. We, under specific conditions, permit our customers to return or exchange products. The provision for estimated sales returns is recorded concurrently with the recognition of revenue. The net impact on gross margin from estimated sales returns is included in allowances against trade accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheet. We also have limited contractual relationships with certain of our customers and suppliers whereby we assume an agency relationship in the transaction. In such arrangements, we recognize as revenues the net fee associated with serving as an agent.Vendor ProgramsFunds received from vendors for price protection, product rebates, marketing/promotion, infrastructure reimbursement and meet-competition programs are recorded as adjustments to product costs, revenue, or selling, general and administrative SGA expenses, according to the nature of the program. Some of these programs may extend over one or more quarterly reporting periods. We accrue rebates or other vendor incentives as earned based on sales of qualifying products or as services are provided in accordance with the terms of the related program48Table of ContentsINGRAM MICRO INC.NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedIn 000s, except per share dataWe sell products purchased from many vendors, but generated approximately 14%, 14%, and 15%of our net sales in 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively, from products purchased from HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise combined, and approximately 12%of our consolidated net sales in 2015 from products purchased from Apple Inc. There were no other vendors whose products represented 10% or more of our net sales for each of the last three fiscal years.WarrantiesOur suppliers generally warrant the products distributed by us and allow returns of defective products, including those that have been returned to us by our customers. We generally do not independently warrant the products we distribute; however, local laws might impose warranty obligations upon distributors such as in the case of supplier liquidation. We are obligated to provide warranty protection for sales of certain IT products within the European Union EU for up to two yearsas required under the EU directive where vendors have not affirmatively agreed to provide pass-through protection. In addition, we warrant the services we provide, products that we build-to-order from components purchased from other sources, and our own branded products. Provision for estimated warranty costs is recorded at the time of sale and periodically adjusted to reflect actual experience. Warranty expense and the related obligations are not material to our consolidated financial statements.Foreign Currency Translation and RemeasurementFinancial statements of our foreign subsidiaries, for which the functional currency is the local currency, are translated into U.S.dollars using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and a weighted average exchange rate for each period for statement of income items. Translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders equity. The functional currency of a few operations within our Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions is the U.S.dollar; accordingly, the monetary assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S.dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues, expenses, gains or losses are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical rates. The resultant remeasurement gains and losses of these operations as well as gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statement of income.Cash and Cash EquivalentsWe consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.Book overdrafts of $428,628and $400,323as of January2, 2016and January3, 2015, respectively, represent checks issued on disbursement bank accounts but not yet paid by such banks. These amounts are classified as accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheet. We typically fund these overdrafts through normal collections of funds or transfers from bank balances at other financial institutions. Under the terms of our facilities with the banks, the respective financial institutions are not legally obligated to honor the book overdraft balances as of January2, 2016and January3, 2015, or any balance on any given date.Trade Accounts Receivable Factoring ProgramsWe have several uncommitted factoring programs under which trade accounts receivable of several customers may be sold, without recourse, to financial institutions. Available capacity under these programs is dependent on the level of our trade accounts receivable eligible to be sold into these programs and the financial institutions willingness to purchase such receivables. At January2, 2016and January3, 2015, we had a total of $388,358and $276,808, respectively, of trade accounts receivable sold to and held by the financial institutions under these programs. Factoring fees of $4,565, $4,757, and $2,851incurred in 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively, related to the sale of trade accounts receivable under both facilities are included in other in the other expense income section of our consolidated statement of income.InventoryOur inventory consists of finished goods purchased from various vendors for resale. Inventory is stated at the lower of average cost or market, and is determined from the price we pay vendors, including freight and duties. We do not include labor, overhead or other general or administrative costs in our inventory49Table of ContentsINGRAM MICRO INC.NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedIn 000s, except per share dataProperty and EquipmentProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives noted below. We also capitalize computer software costs that meet both the definition of internal-use software and defined criteria for capitalization. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life. Depreciable lives of property and equipment are as   equipment5-10yearsComputer equipment and software3-10yearsMaintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to expense as incurred. Additions, major renewals and betterments to property and equipment are capitalized.Long-Lived and Intangible AssetsWe assess potential impairments to our long-lived and intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. If required, an impairment loss is recognized as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the assets. The gross carrying amounts of finite-lived identifiable intangible assets of $537,308and $488,753at January2, 2016and January3, 2015, respectively, are amortized over their remaining estimated lives ranging up to 12years with the predominant amounts having lives of 3to 10years. The net carrying amount was $374,674and $318,689at January2, 2016and January3, 2015, respectively. Amortization expense was $62,138, $58,962and $48,480for 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively. Future minimum amortization expense of finite-lived identifiable intangible assets that we expect to recognize over the next five years and thereafter are as follows:  2015, we recognized a non-cash, pre-tax charge related to the impairment of internally developed software of $121,001primarily due to the decision to cancel future deployments of SAP. During the second quarter of 2014, we wrote-off a previously acquired trade name of $7,528as a result of the integration of certain operations under the Ingram Micro brand. There were noimpairments to our long-lived and other identifiable intangible assets in 2013.GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in an acquisition and is reviewed annually for potential impairment, or when circumstances warrant.Additions to goodwill in 2015 were primarily due to our acquisitions of Anovo, Odin, DocData, and Aco. Additionally, we adjusted goodwill in 2015 to reflect the finalization of the allocation of purchase price related to our acquisition of Armada Computer Systems Armada. 50Table of ContentsINGRAM MICRO INC.NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedIn 000s, except per share dataGoodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Goodwill impairment tests require judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment during our fiscal fourth quarter. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a Step 0 analysis. If, based on a review of qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform Step 1 of the two-step goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we measure the amount of impairment loss, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount. Our most recent annual review, based on qualitative factors, indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill, as it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was greater than its carrying value. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows:  AmericaTotalBalance at December 28,  at January 3,  at January 2,  of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable from customers and vendors, and derivative financial instruments. Our cash and cash equivalents are deposited and/or invested with various financial institutions globally that are monitored by us regularly for credit quality. Our trade accounts receivable reflect a large number of customers and dispersed across wide geographic areas, none of which has accounted for 10%or more of our consolidated net sales in 2015, 2014and 2013and no customer accounts receivable balance was greater than 10%of our total trade accounts receivable at January2, 2016nor January3, 2015. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions, obtain credit insurance in many locations and require collateral in certain circumstances. We maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses.Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe operate in various locations around the world. We reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments in situations where there are not offsetting balances that create a natural hedge. The market risk related to the foreign exchange agreements is offset by changes in the valuation of the underlying items being hedged. In accordance with our policy, we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor are we a party to leveraged derivatives.Foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by using forward contracts to hedge foreign currency-denominated receivables, payables and intercompany loans and expenses. Interest rate swaps and forward contracts may be used to hedge foreign currency-denominated principal and interest payments related to intercompany loans.All derivatives are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments represents the amount required to enter into similar offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities based on market-derived prices. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in current earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income51Table of ContentsINGRAM MICRO INC.NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedIn 000s, except per share dataThe notional amount of forward exchange contracts is the amount of foreign currency bought or sold at maturity. The notional amount of interest rate swaps is the underlying principal amount used in determining the interest payments exchanged over the life of the swap. Notional amounts are indicative of the extent of our involvement in the various types and uses of derivative financial instruments but are not a measure of our exposure to credit or market risks through our use of derivatives.Credit exposure for derivative financial instruments is limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties. We manage the potential risk of credit losses through careful evaluation of counterparty credit standing, selection of counterparties from a limited group of financial institutions and other contract provisions including collateral deposits.Treasury StockWe account for repurchased shares of common stock as treasury stock. Treasury shares are recorded at cost and are included as a component of stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheet.Comprehensive IncomeComprehensive income consists primarily of our net income and foreign currency translation adjustments.Earnings Per ShareWe report a dual presentation of Basic Earnings Per Share BasicEPS and Diluted Earnings Per Share DilutedEPS. BasicEPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reported period. DilutedEPS uses the treasury stock method to compute the potential dilution that could occur if stock-based awards and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised.The computation of BasicEPS and DilutedEPS is as follows:Fiscal Year Ended201520142013Net  average  EPS$140$172$203Weighted average shares, including the dilutive effect of stock-based awards 3,096, 3,960 and 3,372 for 2015, 2014 and 2013,  EPS$137$167$199There were approximately 2,545, 1,772and 2,069stock-based awards in 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively, which were not included in the computation of Diluted EPS because the exercise price was greater than the average market price of the ClassA Common Stock, thereby resulting in an antidilutive effect.Income TaxesWe estimate income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing the future tax impact of any differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items, such as the timing for recognizing revenues and expenses for tax versus financial reporting purposes. These differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet. We are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carryforwards, tax credits and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years, will be recoverable from future taxable income. In making that assessment, we consider the nature of the deferred tax assets and related statutory limits on utilization, recent operating results, future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. If, based upon available evidence, recovery of the full amount of the deferred tax assets is not likely; we provide a valuation allowance on any amount not likely to be realized52Table of ContentsINGRAM MICRO INC.NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedIn 000s, except per share dataOur effective tax rate includes the impact of not providing taxes on undistributed foreign earnings considered indefinitely reinvested. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate if we no longer consider our foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested.The provision for tax liabilities and recognition of tax benefits involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations by various taxing authorities. In situations involving uncertain tax positions related to income tax matters, we do not recognize benefits unless their sustainability is deemed more likely than not. As additional information becomes available, or these uncertainties are resolved with the taxing authorities, revisions to these liabilities or benefits may be required, resulting in additional provision for or benefit from income taxes reflected in our consolidated statement of income.Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationWe use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and the closing market price of our common stock on the date of the grant to determine the fair value of our restricted stock and restricted stock units. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded for all stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units that are ultimately expected to vest as the requisite service is rendered. We recognize these compensation costs, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is the vesting term of outstanding stock-based awards. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on our historical experience during the preceding five fiscal years.New Accounting StandardsIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued an accounting standard that will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP. The new standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods and services. The accounting standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this standard, and management is currently evaluating which transition approach to use. Early adoption is permitted in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.We are currently in the process of assessing what impact this new standard may have on our consolidated financial statements and evaluating our potential adoption method.In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,Interest-Imputation of Interest Subtopic 835-30: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-Of-Credit Arrangements and Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting. The guidance in the previously issued ASU 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest Subtopic 835-30: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs does not address presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The standard is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, and we intend to adopt this standard in 2016.In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-2,Leases Topic 842. This update will increase transparency and comparability by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required recognize the following for all leases with the exception of short-term leases at the commencement date i a lease liability, which is a lessees obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and ii a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessees right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged, and it simplified the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions. Lessees will no longer be provided with a source of off-balance sheet financing. Lessees for capital and operating leases and lessors for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently in the process of assessing what impact this new standard may have on our consolidated financial statements53Table of ContentsINGRAM MICRO INC.NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedIn 000s, except per share dataNote 3 Reorganization Costs2015 and 2014 ActionsOn February 13, 2014 we announced a plan to proceed with a global organizational effectiveness program that involved aligning and leveraging our infrastructure globally with our evolving businesses, opportunities and resources, and de-layering and simplifying the organization. On May 4, 2015, we announced our intention to take certain global actions to further streamline our cost structure. During the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016, and January 3, 2015, we recognized net reorganization charges of $36,309, and $93,545, respectively. The reorganization charges during the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016 primarily related to employee termination benefits. During the fiscal year ended January 3, 2015, the reorganization charges primarily related to $85,791of employee termination benefits, and $7,528for a previously acquired trade name that we wrote-off as we integrated certain operations under the Ingram Micro brand. 2013 ActionsIn 2013, we incurred net reorganization costs primarily relating to a number of key initiatives, including: a the integration of BrightPoint operations into Ingram Micro, resulting in headcount reductions and the closure of certain BrightPoint facilities, and the exit of a portion of our Australian offices in Asia-Pacific; b headcount reductions in Europe to respond to the current market environment, and c the transition of certain transaction-oriented service and support functions to shared services centers.A summary of the reorganization and expense-reduction program costs incurred in 2015, 2014, and 2013 are as follows:Reorganization costsHeadcount ReductionEmployee Termination BenefitsFacility Costs/OtherTotal Reorganization CostsAdjustments to Prior Year CostsTotal CostsFiscal year ended-2015North   year ended-2014North   year ended-2013North   of ContentsINGRAM MICRO INC.NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedIn 000s, except per share dataAdjustments in the table above primarily reflect increases or decreases in estimated costs for employee terminations or to exit facilities.

The major class of assets and liabilities to which we preliminarily allocated the purchase price was $58,043to goodwill. The goodwill recognized in connection with this acquisition is primarily attributable to assembled workforce and the enhancement of value-add IT solutions to our distribution business in Latin America. On December 18, 2015, we acquired all the outstanding shares of DocData, for a cash payment of $144,752, net of cash acquired. DocData is one of the leading European providers of order fulfillment, returns logistics and on-line payment services that also provides critical commerce solutions to major retailers, brands and promising start-ups. The major class of assets and liabilities to which we preliminarily allocated the purchase price was $133,538to goodwill. The goodwill recognized in connection with this acquisition is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and the enhancement of our commerce and fulfillment services business. 55Table of ContentsINGRAM MICRO INC.NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedIn 000s, except per share dataOn December 18, 2015, we acquired the assets of Odin, for a cash payment of $163,906, net of cash acquired, which will enhance our cloud management platform technologies. The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we preliminarily allocated the purchase price were $65,240to identifiable intangible assets and $109,768to goodwill. The identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trade name and developed technology with estimated useful lives that range from three to six years. The goodwill recognized in connection with this acquisition is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and the enhancement of our cloud strategy.On June 14, 2015, we acquired a 75%majority interest in Aptec Saudi, the largest value-added technology distributor in Saudi Arabia for a payment of $5,200, net of cash acquired. In addition, the purchase price includes a deferred payment of $1,872, payable over the next fiscal year. The major class of assets and liabilities to which we preliminarily allocated the purchase price were identifiable intangible assets of $5,258. The identifiable intangible asset consists of customer relationships with estimated useful lives of seven years. As of January 2, 2016, we recorded minority interest of $1,800in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet for the remaining 25%interest in Aptec Saudi.On March 16, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of certain subsidiaries of Tech Data located in Latin America for a cash payment of $15,978, net of cash acquired, and the assumption of debt of $43,658. The consideration paid was preliminarily allocated to the fair value of net tangible assets, which primarily consisted of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable. On February 27, 2015, we acquired 975%of the outstanding shares of Anovo, a leading global provider of device lifecycle services for a payment of $68,123, net of cash acquired, plus assumption of debt of $32,486. The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price were $52,728to identifiable intangible assets, and $26,428to goodwill. The identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of developed technology, a trade name and customer relationships with estimated useful lives that range from four to ten years. The goodwill recognized in connection with this acquisition is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce. During the second half of the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016, we acquired an additional 25%of the outstanding shares of Anovo for $1,391. As of January 2, 2016, we own 100%of the outstanding shares of Anovo. In addition, during fiscal year ended January2, 2016, we completed threesmall but strategic acquisitions for cash aggregating $1,924, and an estimated future earn-out payment of $613. These acquisitions will enhance our existing portfolio of products and services. The purchase price was preliminarily allocated to the assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the transaction date, resulting in the recording of identifiable intangible assets of $1,294, and $1,210to goodwill. The identifiable intangible assets are primarily related to customer relationships with an estimated useful life of five years. These entities have been included in our consolidated results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented for the 2015 acquisitions because the effects of the business combinations for these acquisitions, individually and in aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations. For our recent acquisitions, asset valuations are still in progress and the amounts preliminarily allocated to goodwill and intangible assets will be finalized in 2016. 2014 AcquisitionsOn December 1, 2014, we acquired 58%of the outstanding shares of Armada, a leading IT value distributor in Turkey for consideration paid of$20,100, net of cash acquired. The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we preliminarily allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $4,970, and identifiable intangible assets of $9,949, primarily consisting of a trade name and customer relationships with estimated useful lives of five years. The goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and our expectation of expanding Armadas brand, and enhancing our existing enterprise solutions portfolio and channel development experience in the small and medium sized business market, credit services, training and other professional offering in Turkey. As of January 3, 2015, we recorded minority interest of $17,666in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet for the remaining 42%of the outstanding shares.

On April 15, 2015, we extended the maturity of this program from November 2015 to April 2018. Subject to the financial institutions approval and availability of eligible receivables, this program may be increased by $250,000in accordance with the extended terms of the program. The interest rate of this program is dependent on designated commercial paper rates or, in certain circumstances, an alternate rate plus a predetermined margin. We had borrowings of $0and $185,000at January2, 2016and January3, 2015, respectively, under this North American financing program.During 2015, we had threerevolving trade accounts receivable-backed financing programs in Europe and in Asia-Pacific:iA program which provides for a borrowing capacity of up to 105,000, or approximately $114,062at January2, 2016exchange rates, maturing in January 2017. iiA program which provides for a maximum borrowing capacity of up to 160,000Australian dollars, or approximately $116,432at January2, 2016exchange rates, maturing in June 2017iiiA program which provided for a maximum borrowing capacity of up to 45,000which was terminated December 1, 2015.The current programs require certain commitment fees, and borrowings under this program incur financing costs based on the local short-term bank indicator rate for the currency in which the drawing is made plus a predetermined margin. We had noborrowings at January2, 2016and January3, 2015under any of these financing programs58Table of ContentsINGRAM MICRO INC.NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedIn 000s, except per share dataOur ability to access financing under all our trade accounts receivable-backed financing programs in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific, as discussed above, is dependent upon the level of eligible trade accounts receivable as well as continued covenant compliance. We may lose access to all or part of our financing under these programs under certain circumstances, including: aa reduction in sales volumes leading to related lower levels of eligible trade accounts receivable; bfailure to meet certain defined eligibility criteria for the trade accounts receivable, such as receivables remaining assignable and free of liens and dispute or set-off rights; cperformance of our trade accounts receivable; and/or dloss of credit insurance coverage for our European and Asia-Pacific facilities. At January2, 2016, our actual aggregate capacity under these programs was approximately $905,494based on eligible trade accounts receivable available, of which $0of such capacity was used. Even if we do not borrow, or choose not to borrow to the full available capacity of certain programs, most of our trade accounts receivable-backed financing programs prohibit us from assigning, transferring or pledging the underlying eligible receivables as collateral for other financing programs. At January2, 2016, the amount of trade accounts receivable which would be restricted in this regard totaled approximately $1,622,845.We have a $1,500,000revolving senior unsecured credit facility from a syndicate of multinational banks. The total commitment of this facility can be further increased by $350,000, subject to certain conditions. The interest rate on this facility is based on LIBOR, plus a predetermined margin that is based on our debt ratings and leverage ratio. We had noborrowings at January2, 2016and January3, 2015, under this credit facility. This credit facility may also be used to issue letters of credit. At January2, 2016and January3, 2015, letters of credit of $8,499and $12,141, respectively, were issued to certain vendors and financial institutions to support purchases by our subsidiaries, payment of insurance premiums and flooring arrangements. Our available capacity under the agreement is reduced by the amount of any outstanding letters of credit.We also have additional lines of credit, short-term overdraft facilities and other credit facilities with various financial institutions worldwide, which provide for borrowing capacity aggregating approximately $924,749at January2, 2016. Most of these arrangements are on an uncommitted basis and are reviewed periodically for renewal. At January2, 2016and January3, 2015, respectively, we had $134,132and $187,026outstanding under these facilities. The weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under these facilities, which may fluctuate depending on geographic mix, was 68%and 69%per annum at January2, 2016and January3, 2015, respectively. At January2, 2016and January3, 2015, letters of credit totaling $54,879and $37,195, respectively, were issued to various customs agencies and landlords to support our subsidiaries. The issuance of these letters of credit reduces our available capacity under these agreements by the same amount.We are required to comply with certain financial covenants under the terms of certain of our financing facilities, including restrictions on funded debt and liens and covenants related to tangible net worth, leverage and interest coverage ratios and trade accounts receivable portfolio performance including metrics related to receivables and payables. We are also restricted by other covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the amount of additional indebtedness we can incur, dividends we can pay, and the amount of common stock that we can repurchase annually. At January2, 2016, we were in compliance with all material covenants or other material requirements set forth in all of our credit facilities. Note7 Income TaxesWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The estimates and assumptions we use in computing the income taxes reflected in our consolidated financial statements could differ from the actual results reflected in our income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. We record adjustments based on filed returns as such returns are finalized and resultant adjustments are identified.The components of income before income taxes consist of the following:Fiscal Year Ended201520142013United  of ContentsINGRAM MICRO INC.NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedIn 000s, except per share dataThe provision for income taxes consists of the following:Fiscal Year  for income  reconciliation of the statutory U.S.federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate is as follows:Fiscal Year Ended201520142013U.S. statutory rate350%350%350%State income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit021515U.S. tax on foreign earnings, net of foreign tax credits020346Effect of international  of change in valuation  tax rate274%324%288%60Table of ContentsINGRAM MICRO INC.NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedIn 000s, except per share dataDeferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Net deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current in the consolidated statements of financial position. Significant components of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:Fiscal Year End20152014Deferred tax assets:Net operating loss  credit  benefits, including stock-based  and restructuring  and  on trade accounts  and accruals not currently deductible for income tax  deferred tax assets646,481662,054Valuation  tax liabilities:Depreciation and  basis difference on earnings of foreign  deferred tax  deferred tax assets$117,143$107,411We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including the nature of the deferred tax assets and related statutory limits on utilization, recent operating results, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of or less than the net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce or increase the provision for income taxes.We considered the impact of changes in business strategy, including the decision in the second quarter of 2015 to cancel future deployments of SAP, which resulted in a decrease in projected foreign source income, primarily due to lower royalties from foreign affiliates, and, as such, a decrease in projected utilization of Foreign Tax Credits. Consequently, we increased the valuation allowance on Foreign Tax Credits resulting in a non-cash charge of $14,580which impacted both the second quarter and full year effective tax rate.We also considered new events that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2015, in particular the acquisition of Aco, which included a very profitable Brazilian business, which combined with our existing Brazilian operations, is forecasted to generate higher levels of taxable profits going forward.  We also reevaluated all other available positive and negative evidence and ultimately concluded it was now more likely than not the deferred tax assets, primarily net operating losses NOLs with an indefinite carryfoward life, would be realized. As a result, we reversed the full valuation allowance against Brazilian deferred tax assets recorded to date. The release generated a non-cash benefit of $14,258, which impacted both the fourth quarter and full year effective tax rate.At January2, 2016, we had deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards of $301,522, along with a valuation allowance of $258,426, with the net amount reflecting the amount more likely than not to be realized. Of the remaining $43,096of net deferred tax assets associated with NOL carryforwards, $32,105has no expiration date. A portion of the carryforwards may expire before being applied to reduce future income tax liabilities. We monitor all of our other deferred tax assets for realizability in a similar manner to those described above and will record or release valuation allowances as required to reflect the amount more likely than not to be realized61Table of ContentsINGRAM MICRO INC.NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedIn 000s, except per share dataAt January2, 2016, our tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were $146,157. Foreign tax credit carryforwards in the U.S. represent $144,379of that amount, and our total valuation allowance related to such credit carryforwards was $76,715. The net deferred tax asset reflects the amount more likely than not to be realized based on our current ability to generate the character of income required to utilize these credits prior to expiry through 2025. A number of different Federal and State credits with various expiry dates comprised the remaining $1,778of tax credit carryforwards.The valuation allowance increased by a net $1,917during 2015, driven primarily by the increase in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to net operating losses in Luxembourg and U.S. foreign tax credit carryfowards, which, as described above, was largely offset by the valuation allowance release on Brazil deferred tax assets, as well as the impacts of translation adjustments for previously established valuation allowances in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The remaining change relates primarily to book operating losses in certain subsidiaries that are currently not expected to be realized through future taxable income in these entities, partially offset by previously reserved amounts that became realizable based on taxable income generated in the current year.We have not provided deferred taxes on undistributed earnings from certain of our foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested. These undistributed earnings may become taxable upon an actual or deemed repatriation of assets from the subsidiaries or a sale or liquidation of the subsidiaries. We estimate that our total net undistributed earnings upon which we have not provided deferred tax totals approximately $2,200,000at January2, 2016, and $2,100,000at January3, 2015. A determination of the deferred tax liability on such earnings is not practicable as such liability is dependent upon our U.S. foreign tax credit position that would exist at the time any remittance would occur.Tax benefits claimed from the exercise of employee stock options and other employee stock programs that are in excess of less than the amount recorded upon grant are recorded as an increase decrease in stockholders equity. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, these amounts totaled $3,029, $5,531, and $422, respectively.The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is $23,445as of January2, 2016, substantially all of which would impact the effective tax rate if recognized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the total amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:Fiscal Year Ended201520142013Gross unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of the  in tax positions for prior years2,4424,918Decreases in tax positions for prior  in tax positions for current  in statute of  unrecognized tax benefits at end of the year$23,445$30,372$35,398We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Total accruals for interest and penalties on our unrecognized tax benefits were $6,652and $7,625as of January2, 2016and January3, 2015, respectively.We conduct business globally and, as a result, we and/or one or more of our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S.federal and various state jurisdictions and in over fortyforeign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate. In the U.S., the IRS has concluded its examination for the years prior to 2012. In our material tax jurisdictions, the statute of limitations is open, in general, for threeto fiveyears.It is possible that within the next twelve months, ongoing tax examinations in the U.S. states and several of our foreign jurisdictions may be resolved, that new tax exams may commence and that other issues may be effectively settled. However, we do not expect our assessment of unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over that time62Table of ContentsINGRAM MICRO INC.NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedIn 000s, except per share dataNote 8 Derivative Financial InstrumentsOur derivatives designated as hedging instruments have consisted primarily of foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency-denominated intercompany management fees. We also use foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated as hedges primarily to manage currency risk associated with foreign currency-denominated trade accounts receivable, accounts payable and intercompany loans. At January2, 2016and January3, 2015, we had noderivatives that are designated as hedging instruments.The notional amounts and fair values of derivative instruments in our consolidated balance sheet were as follows:Notional Amounts1Fair  not receiving hedge accounting treatment recorded in:Other current assetsForeign exchange  expensesForeign exchange  Notional amounts represent the gross amount of foreign currency bought or sold at maturity for foreign exchange contracts.The amount recognized in earnings from our derivative instruments not receiving hedge accounting treatment, including ineffectiveness, is recorded in net foreign exchange loss gain as follows and was largely offset by the change in fair value of the underlying hedged assets or liabilities:Fiscal Year Ended201520142013Net gain loss recognized in  Fair Value MeasurementsOur assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level1 quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; Level2 observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data; and Level3 unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.As of January2, 2016, our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are categorized in the table below:January2, 2016TotalLevel 1Level 2Level 3Assets:Cash equivalents, consisting primarily of money market accounts and short-term certificates of  trading securities a51,72051,720Derivative assets54,13354,133Total assets at fair   consideration3,3713,371Total liabilities at fair value$11,588$$8,217$3,371a Included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet63Table of ContentsINGRAM MICRO INC.NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedIn 000s, except per share dataAs of January3, 2015, our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are categorized in the table below:January3, 2015TotalLevel 1Level 2Level 3Assets:Cash equivalents, consisting primarily of money market accounts and short-term certificates of deposit$90$90$$Marketable trading securities a56,61656,616Derivative assets31,21331,213Total assets at fair   consideration7,6477,647Total liabilities at fair value$9,440$$1,793$7,647a Included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet.The fair value of the cash equivalents approximated cost and the gain or loss on the marketable trading securities was recognized in the consolidated statement of income to reflect these investments at fair value.Our senior unsecured notes due in 2024, 2022 and 2017 are stated at amortized cost, and their respective fair values were determined based on Level 2 criteria. The fair values and carrying values of these notes are shown in the table below:January2, 2016Fair ValueCarrying ValueTotalLevel 1Level 2Level 3Liabilities:Senior unsecured notes, 525% due  unsecured notes, 500% due  unsecured notes, 495% due  2015Fair ValueCarrying ValueTotalLevel 1Level 2Level 3Liabilities:Senior unsecured notes, 525% due  unsecured notes, 500% due  unsecured notes, 495% due  carrying amounts of our trade accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these items. Our North American, European and Asia-Pacific revolving trade accounts receivable-backed financing programs bear interest at variable rates based on designated commercial paper rates and local reference rates, respectively, plus a predetermined fixed margin. The interest rates of our revolving unsecured credit facilities and other debt are dependent upon the local short-term bank indicator rate for a particular currency, which also resets regularly. The carrying amounts of all these facilities approximate their fair value because of the revolving nature of the borrowings and because the all-in rate consisting of variable rates and fixed margin adjusts regularly to reflect current market rates with appropriate consideration for our credit profile64Table of ContentsINGRAM MICRO INC.NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedIn 000s, except per share dataNote10 Commitments and ContingenciesOur Brazilian subsidiary received a 2005 Federal import tax assessment claiming certain commercial taxes totaling Brazilian Reais 12,714$3,256at January2, 2016exchange rates were due on the import of software acquired from international vendors for the period January through September of 2002. While we will continue to vigorously pursue administrative and, if applicable, judicial action in defending against this matter, we continue to maintain a reserve for the full tax amount assessed at January 2, 2016.Our Brazilian subsidiary has also received a number of additional tax assessments, including the following that have a reasonable possibility of a loss: 1a 2007 Sao Paulo Municipal tax assessment claiming service taxes were due on the resale of acquired software covering years 2002 through 2006, for a total amount of Brazilian Reais 55,083$14,106at January2, 2016exchange rates in principal and associated penalties; 2a 2011 Federal income tax assessment, a portion of which claims statutory penalties totaling Brazilian Reais 15,947$4,084at January2, 2016exchange rates for delays in providing certain electronic files during the audit of tax years 2008 and 2009, which was conducted through the course of 2011; 3 a 2012 Sao Paulo municipal tax assessment claiming service taxes due on the importation of software covering the year 2007 for a total amount of Brazilian Reais 4,494$1,151at January2, 2016exchange rates in principal and associated penalties; and 4 a 2013 Sao Paulo municipal tax assessment claiming service taxes due on the importation of software covering the years 2008, 2009, 2010 and January through May 2011 for a total amount of Brazilian Reais 16,089$4,120at January2, 2016exchange rates in principal and associated penalties. After working with our advisors, we believe the other matters noted above do not represent a probable loss.In addition to the amounts described above, incremental charges for possible penalties, interest and inflationary adjustments could be imposed in an amount up to Brazilian Reais 284,457$72,849at January2, 2016exchange rates for these matters. We believe we have good defenses against each matter and do not believe it is probable that we will suffer a material loss for these matters. In connection with the due diligence performed during the acquisition of Aco, we also discovered a Sao Paulo Municipal Tax assessment claiming service taxes on the resale of acquired software and professional services covering years 2003 through 2008, for a total amount of Brazilian Reais 67,200$17,210at January2, 2016exchange rates in principal and associated interest and penalties. In working with our advisers, we concluded that the portion of the assessment associated with the resale of professional services has a probable risk of loss under existing Brazilian law, while also concluding, consistent with the assessment noted in 2 above that the risk of loss associated with the resale of software is not probable. In structuring our acquisition, Brazilian Reais 76,204$19,516at January2, 2016exchange rates of the purchase price was placed into an escrow account pending conclusion of litigation on this matter. Based on the terms of the escrow, we have accrued Brazilian Reais 7,500$1,921at January 2, 2016 exchange rate, which is the negotiated amount of liability we agreed to cover should the Brazilian courts ultimately conclude Aco was required to pay this service tax. There are various other claims, lawsuits and pending actions against us incidental to our operations. It is the opinion of management that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, we can make no assurances that we will ultimately be successful in our defense of any of these matters.As is customary in the IT distribution industry, we have arrangements with certain finance companies that provide inventory-financing facilities for our customers. In conjunction with certain of these arrangements, we have agreements with the finance companies that would require us to repurchase certain inventory, which might be repossessed from the customers by the finance companies. Due to various reasons, including among other items, the lack of information regarding the amount of saleable inventory purchased from us still on hand with the customer at any point in time, repurchase obligations relating to inventory cannot be reasonably estimated. Repurchases of inventory by us under these arrangements have been insignificant to date.We have guarantees to third parties that provide financing to a limited number of our customers. Net sales under these arrangements accounted for less than one percent of our consolidated net sales for 2015, 2014and 2013. The guarantees require us to reimburse the third party for defaults by these customers up to an aggregate of $7,797. The fair value of these guarantees has been recognized as cost of sales to these customers and is included in other accrued liabilities.We lease the majority of our facilities and certain equipment under noncancelable operating leases. Rental expense, including obligations related to IT outsourcing services, for the years ended 2015, 2014and 2013was $124,876, $117,890and $113,709, respectively. 65Table of ContentsINGRAM MICRO INC.NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedIn 000s, except per share dataFuture minimum rental commitments on operating leases that have remaining noncancelable lease terms as of January2, 2016are as  Segment InformationOur reporting units coincide with the geographic operating segments which include North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America.

The Black-Scholes model incorporates various assumptions including volatility, expected life, and interest rates. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options. The expected life of an award is based on consideration of historical experience and the terms and conditions of the stock-based awards granted to employees. The fair value of options granted in 2015, 2014and 2013was using the following weighted average assumptions:Fiscal Year Ended201520142013Expected life of stock options45 years37 years31 yearsRisk-free interest rate153%095%057%Expected stock volatility256%263%259%Fair value of options granted$647$588$362Through 2015, substantially all options were granted prior to our anticipation of initiating a dividend. As such, no dividend was assumed in our estimates of the fair values of these options.Equity Incentive PlanWe currently have a single stock incentive plan, the Ingram Micro Inc. 2011 Incentive Plan as amended the 2011 Incentive Plan, for the granting of equity-based incentive awards including incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights, among others, to key employees and members of our Board of Directors. During the second quarter of 2013, our stockholders approved an amendment of the Ingram Micro Inc. 2011 Incentive Plan the 2011 AmendedPlan, which increased the number of shares that we may issue by 12,000. The authorized pool of shares available for grant is a fungible pool. The authorized share limit is reduced by oneshare for every share subject to a stock option or stock appreciation right granted and 237shares for every share granted after June8, 2011 229shares after June 7, 2013 under any award other than an option or stock appreciation right for awards.We grant time- and/or performance-vested restricted stock and/or restricted stock units, in addition to stock options, to key employees and members of our Board of Directors. Options granted generally vest over a period of up to threeyears and have expiration dates not longer than tenyears. In 2015 and 2014, a majority of the options granted had a contractual term of sevenand fiveyears, respectively. A portion of the restricted stock and restricted stock units vest over a time period of oneto threeyears. The remainder of the restricted stock and restricted stock units vests upon achievement of certain performance measures over a time period of oneto threeyears. In 2015, 2014and 2013, the performance measures for restricted stock and restricted stock units for grants to management were based on earnings growth, return on invested capital, operating margin, total shareholder return and profit before tax. As of January2, 2016, approximately 10,517shares were available for grant under the 2011 Amended Plan, taking into account granted options, time-vested restricted stock units/awards and performance-vested restricted stock units assuming maximum achievement.During 2015, 2014and 2013previously granted restricted stock units of 1,500, 1,181and 2,101, respectively, were converted to ClassA Common Stock. Approximately 526, 421and 684shares, respectively, were withheld to satisfy the employees minimum statutory obligation for the applicable taxes and cash was remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities. Total payments for the employees tax obligations to the taxing authorities were approximately $14,201, $11,778and $13,045in 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively. The withheld shares had the effect of share repurchases by us as they reduced and retired the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting. Of the restricted stock and/or units that were converted to ClassA Common Stock, there were 1,015, 620and 1,535in 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively, based on performance-based grants previously approved by the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors. 69Table of ContentsINGRAM MICRO INC.NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedIn 000s, except per share dataStock Award ActivityStock option activity under the 2011 Amended Plan was as follows for the three years ended January2,   at December 29,  at December 28,  at January 3,  at January 2,  and expected to vest at January 2,  at January 2, 20161,965$231121$14,296The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the difference between our closing stock price on January2, 2016and the option exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options on January2, 2016.

Under the cash dividend policy, holders of our common stock receive dividends as declared by our Board of Directors.

Share Repurchase ProgramIn July 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a new three-year, $300,000share repurchase program, which supplemented our previously authorized $400,000share repurchase program and has been completely utilized at January 2, 2016. Our new $300,000share repurchase program expires on July 29, 2018, and had $165,068remaining for repurchase at January 2, 2016. Under these programs, we may repurchase shares in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Our repurchases are funded with available borrowing capacity and cash. The timing and amount of specific repurchase transactions will depend upon market conditions, corporate considerations and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We account for repurchased shares of common stock as treasury stock. Treasury shares are recorded at cost and are included as a component of stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheet. We have issued shares of common stock out of our cumulative balance of treasury shares. Such shares are issued to certain of our associates upon the exercise of their options or vesting of their equity awards under the 2011 Incentive Plan See Note 12, Stock-Based Compensation. 71Table of ContentsINGRAM MICRO INC.NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedIn 000s, except per share dataOur treasury stock repurchase and issuance activity for 2015, 2014and 2013are summarized as  AmountRepurchasedCumulative balance at December 29,  of ClassA Common  balance at December 28,  of ClassA Common  balance at January 3,  of ClassA Common  of ClassA Common  balance at January 2,  of Common StockWe have twoclasses of Common Stock, consisting of 500,000authorized shares of $001par value ClassA Common Stock and 135,000authorized shares of $001par value ClassB Common Stock, and 25,000authorized shares of $001par value Preferred Stock.There were no issued and outstanding shares of ClassB Common Stock or Preferred Stock during the three-year period ended January2, 2016.

In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January2, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it has classified deferred taxes on its consolidated balance sheet as of January 2, 2016, on a prospective basis.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPOrange County, CaliforniaFebruary 25, 201675Table of Contents
