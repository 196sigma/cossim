REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders of FiberNet
Telecom Group, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FiberNet Telecom Group, Inc. FiberNet or
the Company as of December31, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for the year ended December31, 2007. These financial statements are the responsibility of
FiberNets management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted
our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of FiberNet Telecom Group, Inc., as of December31, 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended December31, 2007,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  /S/FRIEDMAN

Telecom Group, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FiberNet Telecom Group, Inc. FiberNet or
the Company as of December31, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December31, 2006. These financial statements
are the responsibility of FiberNets management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control
over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of FiberNet Telecom Group, Inc., as of December31, 2006, and the results of their

FIBERNET TELECOM GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS FiberNet Telecom
Group, Inc. hereinafter referred to as the Company or FiberNet is a communications service provider focused on providing complex interconnection services enabling the exchange of voice, video and data traffic between global
networks. The Company owns and operates integrated colocation facilities and diverse transport routes in the two gateway markets of New York/New Jersey and Los Angeles. FiberNets network infrastructure and facilities are designed to provide
comprehensive broadband interconnectivity for the worlds largest network operators, including leading domestic and international telecommunications carriers, service providers and enterprises. The Company delivers core network backbone
services for mission critical requirements. FiberNet is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of FiberNet
Operations, Inc. Operations, a Delaware corporation and an intermediate level holding company, and 96% of the outstanding membership interests of Devnet L.L.C. Devnet, a Delaware limited liability company. Operations owns
all of the outstanding common stock of FiberNet Telecom, Inc. FTI, a Delaware corporation, and the remaining 4% of Devnet. FTI owns all of the outstanding membership interests of Local Fiber, LLC Local Fiber, a New York
limited liability company, and all of the outstanding membership interests of FiberNet Equal Access, LLC Equal Access, also a New York limited liability company. FTI also owns all of the outstanding membership interests of Availius,
LLC Availius, a New York limited liability company. The Company conducts its primary business operations through its operating subsidiaries, Devnet, Availius, Local Fiber and Equal Access. The Company has agreements with other entities, including telecommunications license agreements with building landlords, interconnection agreements with
other telecommunications service providers and leases with carrier hotel property owners. FiberNet also has entered into contracts with suppliers for the components of its telecommunications networks. Under FiberNets current operating plan, including its new credit facility see Note 6, the Company does not anticipate requiring any additional
external sources of capital to fund its operations in the near term. However, from time to time, the Company may consider private or public sales of additional equity or debt securities and other financings, depending upon market conditions, in
order to provide additional working capital or finance the continued operations of our business. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, except for outstanding letters of credit, nor does it anticipate entering into
any. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Operations, Devnet, FTI, Equal Access, Availius and Local Fiber and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
45  FIBERNET TELECOM GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased. The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity of the
instruments. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, once placed in service. The estimated lives are as
follows:  Computer software
3 Years
Computer equipment
3 Years
Office equipment and fixtures
5 Years
Leasehold improvements
15 Years or remaining life of lease, whichever is shorter
Network equipment
10 Years
Network infrastructure
20 Years
Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Improvements are capitalized as additions to
property, plant and equipment. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets SFAS No144 whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual
disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets. Revenue Recognition FiberNet generates revenues from
selling network capacity and related services to other communications service providers. The Company recognizes revenues when earned as services are provided throughout the life of each sales order with a customer. The majority of the Companys
revenues are generated on a monthly recurring basis under contracts of various lengths, ranging from one month to fifteen years. Most of the Companys services are purchased for a contract period of one year. Revenue is recognized over the
service contract period for all general services. If the Company determines that collection of a receivable is not reasonably assured, it defers the revenue and recognizes it at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon
receipt of payment. Deferred revenues consist primarily of payments received in advance of revenue being earned under the service contracts. Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from
customers failure to make payments. Management determines the estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable by considering a number of factors, including: 1historical experience; 2aging of the accounts
receivable; and 3specific information obtained by the Company on the financial condition and the current creditworthiness of its customers. 
46  FIBERNET TELECOM GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company estimates that the carrying value of its financial instruments approximates fair value, as all financial instruments are short term in nature
or bear interest at variable rates. Goodwill Cost in excess of net assets of an acquired business, principally goodwill, is accounted for under SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS No142. SFAS No142 requires goodwill and
certain intangible assets no longer be amortized, but instead be reviewed for recoverability. The Company performs its annual impairment test in December. The Company also tests for impairment if an event occurs that is more likely than not to
reduce the fair value of the Company below its book value. Deferred Charges Deferred charges include the cost to access buildings and deferred financing costs. Costs to access buildings are being amortized over 12 years, which was
the term of the related contracts at their inception. Deferred financing costs are amortized over the term of the related credit facility. Earnings Per
Share Basic earnings per share has been computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
earnings per share is computed by including the dilutive effect on common stock that would be issued assuming conversion of stock options, warrants and other dilutive securities. Options, warrants and other securities did not have an effect on the
computation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, as they were anti-dilutive due to the fact that the Company was in a loss position for the respective periods. Concentration of Credit Risk The Company provides
trade credit to its customers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial conditions, in an attempt to mitigate this risk. As of December31, 2007, one customer accounted for 323% of the Companys
total accounts receivable. As of December31, 2006, one customer accounted for 211% of the Companys total accounts receivable For each of the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, there was no individual customer that accounted for more than 10% of the Companys total revenues. The Company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its historical
experience and any specific customer collection issues that are identified. While such credit losses have historically been within the Companys expectations, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to experience the same level
of credit losses that it has in the past. A significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers or a further deterioration in the economic environment or telecommunications industry, in general, could have a
material adverse impact on the collectability of the Companys accounts receivable and its future operating results, including a reduction in future revenues and additional expenses from increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts.
Stock Based Compensation The Company
makes equity grants comprising of stock options or shares of restricted stock to its employees as part of its employee equity incentive plan. As of December31, 2007, the Company has approximately 
47  FIBERNET TELECOM GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
16million shares authorized for issuance under the plan. Stock options are typically granted to vest in three equal annual installments, commencing on
the grant date, and expire ten years from the date of grant. Restricted stock is typically granted with a four year period before it becomes unrestricted. Equity grants under the plan are made at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors. Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No123 revised 2004, Share Based Payment
SFAS No123R, applying the modified prospective method. Under the modified prospective method, SFAS No123R applies to new awards and to awards that were outstanding as of December31, 2005 that are subsequently
vested, modified, repurchased or cancelled. Compensation expense recognized during the year ended December31, 2007 includes the portion vesting during the period for 1all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of,
December31,2005 based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS
No123 and 2all share-based payments granted subsequent to December31, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Accounting for Income Taxes The Company accounts for
income taxes in accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS No109 which requires the use of the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Under this method, deferred income
taxes represent the net tax effect of temporary differences between carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amount used for income tax purposes. Additionally, if it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to be recognized. Effective January1, 2007,
the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN No48. FIN No48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a
companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No109. FIN No48 requires a company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of
the position. If the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, a company must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements. The application of income tax law is inherently complex. Laws and regulation in
this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As such, the Company is required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding its income tax exposures. Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations
change over time. As such, changes in the Companys subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the balance sheets and statements of income. At the adoption date of January1, 2007, the Company had no
unrecognized tax benefits which would affect its effective tax rate if recognized. At December31, 2007, the Company has no unrecognized tax benefits. The Company classifies interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes
in the statement of income under general and administrative expenses. As of December31, 2007, the Company has no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The tax years 2000 through 2007 remain open to examination by
all taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. In June 2006, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No06-3,
How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement That is, Gross versus Net Presentation EIFT 06-3. EITF 06-3 provides that the presentation of taxes
assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer on either a gross basis included in revenues and costs or on a net basis excluded from revenues is an accounting
policy decision that should be disclosed. The Company presents these taxes on a net basis. 
48  FIBERNET TELECOM GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Segment Reporting The Company is a single segment operating company providing telecommunications services. Revenues were generated by providing transport, colocation and communications access management services to customers. All of
our revenues are generated in the United States of America. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2007, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No06-11, Accounting for Income Tax Benefits on Dividends on Share-Based Payment
Awards EITF 06-11. EITF 06-11 addresses share-based payment arrangements with dividend protection features that entitle employees to receive adividends on equity-classified nonvested shares, bdividend equivalents
on equity-classified nonvested share units, or cpayments equal to the dividends paid on the underlying shares while an equity-classified share option is outstanding, when those dividends or dividend equivalents are charged to retained
earnings under Statement 123R and result in an income tax deduction for the employer. A realized income tax benefit from dividends or dividend equivalents that are charged to retained earnings and are paid to employees for equity-classified
nonvested shares, nonvested equity share units, and outstanding equity share options should be recognized as an increase in additional paid-in capital. The amount recognized in additional paid-in capital for the realized income tax benefit from
dividends on those awards should be included in the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb potential future tax deficiencies on share-based payment awards. The provisions of EITF 06-11 are effective for FiberNet as of January1, 2008.
The Company does not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. In February 2007, FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities-Including an amendment of FASB Statement No115 SFAS No159. SFAS No159
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided the company also
elects to apply the provisions of SFAS No157. The Companys management is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No159, but does not expect the adoption of SFAS No159 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements. 3. EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN On January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No123R, applying the modified prospective method. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No123R, the Company applied the provisions of APB No25, in accounting for its
stock-based awards, and accordingly, recognized no compensation cost for its stock plans other than for its restricted stock awards. Under the modified prospective method, SFAS No123R applies to new awards and to awards that were
outstanding as of December31, 2005 that are subsequently vested, modified, repurchased or cancelled. Compensation expense recognized during the year ended December31, 2006 includes the portion vesting during the period for 1all
share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of December31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No123 and 2all share-based payments granted
subsequent to December31, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company recognizes the cost of all employee stock awards on a straight-line basis over their respective vesting
period, net of estimated forfeitures. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No123R, the Company applied APB No25 to account for
its stock-based awards. Under the provisions of APB No25, the Company was not required to recognize compensation expense for the cost of stock options issued under its equity compensation plans as all options were granted with an exercise
price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The Company has not changed its valuation model used for estimating the fair value of options granted after January1, 2006, from 
49  FIBERNET TELECOM GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model previously used for pro forma presentation purposes as required under SFAS No123, as amended by SFAS
No148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosures. The following table illustrates the
effect on net loss and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No123 for the year ended December31, 2005:  in thousands, except per share data unaudited
FortheyearendedDecember31, 2005 Net loss, as reported 13,935 Deduct: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method, net of related tax effects 146 Pro forma net loss 14,081 Net loss per share As reported: Basic and diluted 269 Pro forma: Basic and diluted 272
Before adoption of SFAS No123R, pro forma disclosures reflected the fair value of each
option grant estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions for grants for the year ended December31, 2005: risk-free interest rate of 435%, expected dividend yield of 0%, expected
life of six years to expiration and expected volatility of 308%. On August20, 2007, the Company issued 261,440 shares of restricted
stock that will become unrestricted four years after the grant date. The Company determined the fair value of the restricted stock granted during 2007 to be $19 million. On August17, 2006, the Company issued 703,000 shares of restricted stock
that will become unrestricted four years after the grant date, and 75,000 stock options with a strike price of $211 per share that vest in three equal annual installments. The Company determined the fair value of the restricted stock granted during
2006 to be $15 million. The Company determined the fair value of the options issued to be $01 million using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 482%, expected dividend yield of 0 expected life of six years to expiration and expected volatility of 133%. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to value options
when issued. The expected volatility assumption used is based solely on historical volatility, calculated using the daily price changes of the Companys common stock over the most recent period equal to the expected life of the stock option on
the date of grant. The risk-free interest rate is determined using the implied yield for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the stock option. The Company does not currently intend to pay cash
dividends, and thus assumes a 0% dividend yield. Beginning on January1, 2006, the expected life of an option is calculated using the simplified method set out in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No107, Share Based Payment,
using the vesting term of 3 years and the contractual term of 10 years. The simplified method defines the expected life as the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period for all option tranches.
As part of the requirements of SFAS No123R, the Company is required to estimate potential forfeitures of stock grants and adjust
compensation cost recorded accordingly. The forfeiture rate was estimated based on relevant historical forfeitures. The estimate of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent that the actual forfeitures differ, or
are expected to differ, from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized through a cumulative catch-up adjustment in the period of change and will also impact the amount of stock compensation expense to be recognized in
future periods. 
50  FIBERNET TELECOM GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
During the year ended December31, 2006 the adoption of SFAS No123R resulted in
incremental stock-based compensation expense of approximately $02 million. The incremental stock-based compensation expense caused net loss to increase by approximately $02 million, and basic and diluted earnings per share to decrease by $001 per
share. As a result of the Companys decision to adopt the modified prospective method, prior period results have not been restated, as permitted by SFAS No123R. A summary of stock option activity within the Companys stock-based compensation plans for the year ended December31, 2007 is as follows:

December31, 2007, the Company granted 261,440 shares of restricted stock that will become unrestricted four years after the grant date. As of December31, 2007, the total amount of unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock awards was approximately $54 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average 
52  FIBERNET TELECOM GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
period of approximately 40 years. The Company recognized compensation expense of approximately $11 million during 2007 on existing restricted stock awards.

recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. During 2005, the Company
recorded an impairment of $28 million to reflect its revised business plan and forecast of revenues due to the early termination of a significant access agreement as well as other renegotiated building access service orders with other customers,
which significantly reduced the Companys future revenues from access services.

6. CREDIT FACILITY On March21, 2007, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement by and among the Company, its subsidiaries and CapitalSource Finance LLC pursuant to which the Company and its subsidiaries established a $250
million credit facility the Credit Facility, consisting of ia $140 million term loan, iia $60 million revolving loan and letter of credit facility and iiia $50 million capital expenditure loan facility, which
was unfunded at closing. The $140 million term loan was used to pay off the Companys existing credit facility with Deutsche Bank A.G. discussed below, which was set to mature in March 2008. The Credit Facility bears interest at floating
rates, depending on the type of borrowing and based on either a Prime Rate or LIBOR Rate, as such terms are defined under the Credit Facility. Borrowing on the $140 million term loan are payable in increasing quarterly installments commencing in
July 2008. The Credit Facility matures in March 2012. The Credit Facility is secured by a first lien on all of the Companys and its subsidiaries existing and future real assets and personal property. The Credit Facility is guaranteed by
the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, and contains restrictive covenants, operating restrictions and other terms and conditions. The Credit Agreement prohibits the payment of cash dividends on common stock. As of December31, 2007, the
outstanding balance under the Credit Facility was $140 million. In addition, as of December31, 2007, the Company had $54 million of outstanding letters of credit and $06 million of availability under its revolving loan credit facility,
again subject to compliance with the terms of the credit agreement. As of December31, 2007, the interest rate on its outstanding borrowings under the facility was at 861%. There were no events of default under its credit agreement.

CapitalSource Finance LLC and CapitalSource CF LLC pursuant to which the Company and its subsidiaries established a new $50 million loan facility the New Loan solely to enable the Company to repurchase outstanding shares of its
capital stock pursuant to its recently announced stock repurchase program. The New Loan, which was unfunded at closing, supplements and is made a part of the Companys existing $250 million Credit Facility. The New Loan will bear interest at
floating rates, depending on the type of borrowing and based on either a Prime Rate or LIBOR Rate, as such terms are defined under the Credit Facility. The applicable margin based upon a LIBOR Rate is 450%, and the applicable margin based on a
Prime Rate is 325%. In addition, the parties adjusted certain of the financial covenants under the Credit Facility. The New Loan will be payable in equal quarterly installments of 375% of the principal amount commencing in April 2010, with the
entire Credit Facility maturing in March 2012. The Company recorded a charge of $11 million related to the early extinguishment of its
former credit facility on March21, 2007, including the write-off of unamortized financing related charges that were associated with the former credit facility.

As of December31, 2006, the outstanding balance under the Fomer Facility was $142 million. The amount included in notes payable in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets is net of an original issue discount of $04 million at December31, 2006. This discount represented the fair value of the warrants issued to the lenders in connection with the origination of the Former
Facility. In addition, as of December31, 2006, the Company had $55 million of outstanding letters of credit and $01 million of availability to issue letters of credit under its Former Facility, again subject to compliance with the terms of

Facility was at 90%. There were no events of default under its credit agreement. As of such date, the Lenders under the Companys Former Facility owned approximately 10% of the outstanding shares of the Companys common stock. 
7. EQUITY TRANSACTIONS On November8, 2007,
the Company announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million of the Companys common stock, either through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of the
shares to be repurchased will be based on market conditions and other factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements and alternative investment opportunities. Any shares repurchased in the program will be cancelled. The repurchase
program is scheduled to terminate on December31, 2008, and may be modified or discontinued at any time. As of December31, 2007, the Company repurchased 86,288 shares of common stock for an average prices of $800 per share, and has
approximately $43 million available for future repurchases. On March22, 2006, the Company entered into a common stock purchase
agreement the Stock Purchase Agreement, with certain investors, pursuant to which the Company issued to the investors, in a private offering, an aggregate of 105million shares of common stock at a price of $210 per share, for
gross proceeds to the Company of $22 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company also issued to such investors warrants with an expiration date three and one-half years after closing to purchase an aggregate of
03million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $264 per share. Additionally, the Company paid its placement agent a fee of $01 million and issued warrants with an expiration date three and one-half years after closing to
purchase an aggregate of 01million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $264 per share. Michael Liss, chairman of the Companys board of directors was and is currently associated with the placement agent but did not receive,
directly or indirectly, any fees or other compensation in connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereunder. The Company also paid $02 million in professional fees in connection with the execution of the
Stock Purchase Agreement. The Company recorded the fees incurred as a result of the Stock Purchase Agreement as a reduction of the net cash proceeds. In connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with the investors, dated as of March22, 2006, which required the Company to file a registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to the resale of ithe shares of common stock issued to the investors, iithe shares of common stock underlying the warrants issued to the investors and iiithe
shares of common stock underlying the warrants issued to the placement agent. The registration statement was filed on April21, 2006 and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on May10, 2006. On March22, 2006, the Company and the lenders executed a twentieth amendment to the Former Facility, pursuant to which, among other things, the
lenders consented to the above-referenced transaction. The twentieth amendment, which was effective as of March22, 2006, extended the maturity date for the credit agreement from February9, 2007 to March7, 2008. The amendment also
fixed the applicable interest rate at 90% and revised the amortization payment schedule to $01 million for June30, 2007, $02 million for September30, 2007 and $03 million for December31, 2007, with the balance due on maturity.
The amendment also irequired the Company on or before May15, 2006, to engage a financial advisor to assist the Company in preparing a comprehensive strategic business plan and iirequired the Company on or prior to May30,
2007, to issue equity to raise proceeds of at least $30 million. In addition, the twentieth amendment removed the lenders observation right for the Companys board of directors and incorporated adjustments to the financial covenants of
the credit facility. During the quarter ended March31, 2006, the Company expensed $01 million for fees related to the twentieth 
55  FIBERNET TELECOM GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
amendment of the credit agreement which was determined to represent a modification of terms under the guidelines set forth in EITF No96-19. On
April24, 2006, the Company engaged a financial advisor to assist us in preparing a comprehensive strategic business plan. The Former Facility was refinanced on March21, 2007. As a condition to the lenders entering into the twentieth amendment, the Company entered into a warrant agreement with the lenders on March22, 2006
the Warrant Agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue warrants with an expiration date three and one-half years after closing to the lenders to purchase an aggregate of 03million shares of common stock at an
exercise price of $264 per share. The Company determined the fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the twentieth amendment to be $06 million using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following assumptions; risk-free
interest rates of 472%, expected dividend yields of 0%, expected life of three and one half years to expiration and expected volatility of 121%. The fair value amount was included in deferred charges and was amortized over the remaining life of the
credit facility. In connection with the Warrant Agreement, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with the lenders, dated as of March22, 2006, which required the Company to file a registration statement with the Securities
and Exchange Commission with respect to the resale of the shares of common stock underlying the warrants issued to the lenders. The registration statement was filed on April21, 2006 and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange
Commission on May10, 2006. On August22, 2005, the Company entered into the eighteenth amendment to the Former Facility with
its lenders, which waived the requirement that the Company issue securities in an amount sufficient to result in net proceeds of at least $65 million. The lenders also agreed to extend the amortization schedule under the Credit Facility such that
the Company had until August 2006 to prepay $30 million, with the balance due in February 2007 and no other principal payments required until such time. As a condition to the lenders entering into the eighteenth amendment, the Company agreed to
reduce the exercise price of certain previously issued outstanding warrants held by the lenders to purchase 49,623 shares of common stock from $3600 per share to $0001 per share, which were subsequently exercised in September 2005 by the lenders.
The Company compared the value of the warrants prior to repricing with the value of the warrants after the repricing using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and determined that there was no difference in value. Therefore, the repricing of
warrants had no impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Additionally, the amendment changes the interest rate on the loans to a fixed rate of 85%, which will increase by 25 basis points on a quarterly basis beginning
January1, 2006 until the date of maturity. The Company also agreed to permit a representative of the lenders to attend and observe its Board of Directors meetings. The amendment required that the Company deliver to the lenders a strategic plan
on or before November20, 2005 and a business plan on or before March31, 2006. In addition, the Amendment provides that Jon A. DeLuca, its President and Chief Executive Officer, is deemed a key employee under the Credit
Facility, such that his failure to serve in those offices would be considered an event of default. In conjunction with the execution of the eighteenth amendment the lenders released the Companys restricted cash of $19 million, which was then
used to reduce the outstanding principle on the credit facility. Also in conjunction with the eighteenth amendment, the Company expensed approximately $02 million in professional fees under the guidelines set forth in Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue EITF 96-19, Debtors Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments EITF No96-19, since the amendment was not deemed an extinguishment. On June21, 2005, the Company entered into the fifteenth amendment to the Former Facility, which extended the date by which it must issue securities
in an amount sufficient to result in net proceeds of at least $65 million pursuant to a purchase agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the lenders, from June23, 2005 to July15, 2005. On July11, 2005, the Company entered
into the sixteenth amendment extended the date from July15, 2005 to July22, 2005. On July22, 2005, the Company entered into the seventeenth amendment, which further extended the date July22, 2005 to August23, 2005. In
connection with the execution of the seventeenth amendment on July22, 2005, the Company paid an amendment fee to the lenders in an amount equal 
56  FIBERNET TELECOM GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
to fifty basis points of the total commitments of the lenders under the credit facility, approximately $01 million. On August5, 2005, the Company paid
an extension fee to the lenders in an amount equal to one hundred basis points of the commitments to the lenders, approximately $03 million. On March22, 2005, the Company executed with its lenders the fourteenth amendment to the Former Facility, pursuant to which, the amortization payments for 2005 were deferred until March 2006, and financial covenant levels were changed.
This amendment required the Company to raise a minimum of $65 million of additional equity capital by June30, 2005. As a condition to the lenders entering into the fourteenth amendment, the Company agreed to reduce the exercise price of
certain previously issued outstanding warrants held by the lenders to purchase 49,623 shares of common stock from $3600 per share to $010 per share, which were subsequently exercised in April 2005 by the lenders. The Company compared the value of
the warrants prior to repricing with the value of the warrants after the repricing using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and determined that there was no difference in value. Therefore, the repricing of warrants had no impact on its
consolidated financial statements. 8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company has entered into various operating lease agreements for office space and other space relating to the Companys operations. Occupancy expense for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005

payable if reduced to avoid triggering the Excise Tax or Bthe total value of the benefits payable even if the Excise Tax applies, such that the net total amount of benefits actually received by such individual is maximized. The Company and its subsidiaries, in the normal course of business, may become party to any number of judicial, regulatory and administrative
proceedings. The Companys management does not believe that any material liability will be imposed as a result of any of these matters. 9. STOCK

future issuance of additional shares of common stock relating to outstanding warrants. As of December31, 2007, the Company had outstanding warrants exercisable into approximately 08million shares of common stock at exercise prices

current or deferred federal income tax provision because the Company had losses for federal income tax purposes. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance, as it does not expect to realize the benefits of the net operating tax losses
generated in those years.

liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amounts of the assets or liabilities are recovered or settled. During the tax years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax asset was recorded. The
valuation allowance represents the portion of tax net operating loss carryforwards and other items for which it is more likely than not that the benefit of such items will not be realized. Based upon the level of historical losses and projections
for the future taxable periods, it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefit of the deferred tax asset. As of
December31, 2007, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $206 million substantially all of which are subject to a de minimus annual limitation on future utilization under
Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. These tax loss carryforwards begin expiring in 2012. Section382 imposes
limitations on the availability of a Companys net operating losses after a more than 50 percentage point ownership change occurs. The Company believes that the most recent ownership changes
