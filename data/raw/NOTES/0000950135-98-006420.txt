ITEM 7
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This discussion and analysis contains certain forward-looking statements.
These forward-looking statements represent TSI beliefs, expectations and
intentions concerning future events, including, without limitation, financial
matters, plans and objectives of management for future operations, products and
services, the future economic performance of TSI, and the assumptions underlying
such beliefs, expectations and intentions. Such statements are not guaranties of
future performance, and involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause
TSI future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-
looking statements made by or on behalf of TSI. Many of such factors are beyond
TSI ability to control or predict. Readers are accordingly cautioned not to
place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. TSI disclaims any intent or
obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether in
response to new information, future events or otherwise. These forward-looking
statements are further qualified by important factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements,
including, without limitation, those discussed above under the heading Risk
Factors at page 2.
OVERVIEW
TSI provides management information technology to hospitals, integrated
delivery networks, physician groups and other health care organizations. Using
TSI products, these organizations are able to increase efficiency, improve
quality of care and lower the cost of care delivery. TSI product lines span the
health care organization information technology needs, providing data
integration services, master person identifier solutions, disease management
products and a clinical data repository as well as enterprise-wide financial,
operational and clinical decision support. TSI was founded in 1985 and has been
profitable in each fiscal year since 1987.
TSI revenues are derived from sales of software licenses and related
implementation services and of software maintenance. The software and
implementation revenues associated with the licensing and installation of TSI
products at an individual customer site typically range from $01 million to
$12 million. Software maintenance contracts are sold separately at the time of
the initial software license sale and are generally renewable annually. Annual
software maintenance fees range from 15% to 18% of the initial software license
fee for the product and provide a source of recurring revenue for TSI.
Software and implementation revenues are accounted for using the percentage
of completion method, and revenue is recognized as contract milestones are
reached. The implementation process generally takes from three to twelve months.
The length of time required to complete an implementation depends on many
factors outside the control of TSI, including the state of the customer
existing information systems and the customer ability to commit the personnel
and other resources necessary to complete elements of the implementation process
for which the customer is responsible. Revenue attributable to a contract
milestone is recognized upon certification by the customer that the milestone
has been met. As a result, TSI may be unable to predict accurately the amount of
revenue it will recognize in any period in connection with the sale of its
products. The payment terms of a contract may provide that the amount of the
contract price that TSI is entitled to bill upon achievement of a milestone is
less than the revenue recognized by TSI in connection with the achievement of
that milestone. In such cases, the excess of the revenue recognized over the
amount billed is included in accounts receivable as an unbilled account
receivable. Software maintenance fees, which are generally received annually in
advance, are recorded as deferred revenue on TSI balance sheet and are
recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contract. See Notes 2 and 3
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of TSI.
Cost of software and implementation revenue consists primarily of the cost
of third-party software that is resold by TSI or included in TSI products,
personnel costs, the cost of related benefits, travel and living
18
expenses, costs of materials and other costs related to the installation and
implementation of TSI products, and amortization of capitalized software
development costs. Cost of maintenance revenue consists primarily of maintenance
fees payable by TSI associated with the third-party software included in TSI
products and personnel costs incurred in providing maintenance and technical
support services to TSI customers.
TSI research and development expenses consist primarily of
personnel-related costs, including employee salaries and benefits and payments
to consultants. TSI capitalizes certain software development costs in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 86, Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed.
Capitalized software costs are amortized over the life of the product generally
three years and amounts amortized are included in cost of software and
implementation revenue. Capitalized software as a percentage of total research
and development expense has declined from 172% in fiscal 1996 to 153% in
fiscal 1997 and 106% in fiscal 1998. In each of fiscal 1996, 1997 and 1998, TSI
capitalized $07 million of software development costs, while amortization of
capitalized software development costs in such years amounted to $08 million 07 million and $07 million, respectively.
In January 1996, TSI repurchased from New England Medical Center and the
other stockholders of TSI 874% of the shares of common stock then issued and
outstanding on a fully diluted basis for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately $1114 million the Recapitalization. The principal purpose of
this transaction was to provide liquidity for the existing stockholders of TSI
while permitting them to retain an ownership interest in TSI. The transaction
has been accounted for by TSI as a leveraged recapitalization. To finance the
repurchase of these shares, TSI issued to Warburg, Pincus Ventures, L.P. and
NationsBank Investment Corporation NIC shares of preferred stock for an
aggregate of $550 million. TSI also issued to NIC Senior Subordinated Notes in
the aggregate principal amount of $100 million and a related warrant and made
borrowings of $400 million under a term loan and a revolving credit facility.
In April 1996, TSI completed an initial public offering of 6,900,000 shares of
its common stock, which generated net proceeds of $1144 million. The
outstanding balance of these borrowings was repaid in full and all outstanding
Series A non-voting preferred stock was redeemed upon the closing of the initial
public offering.
In July 1996, TSI acquired substantially all of the outstanding stock and a
note held by a selling principal of Enterprising HealthCare, Inc. Enterprising
HealthCare, based in Tucson, Arizona, for a total purchase price of
approximately $18 million in cash. Enterprising HealthCare provides system
integration products and services for the health care market. The acquisition
was accounted for under the purchase method with the results of Enterprising
HealthCare included from the date of acquisition. Purchased technology costs of
$16 million are being amortized on a straight-line basis over seven years. Pro
forma results of operations have not been presented, as the effect of this
acquisition on the financial statements was not material.
In January 1997, TSI acquired a 195% ownership interest in HealthVISION
for $60 million in cash. HealthVISION is a Santa Rosa, California provider of
electronic medical record software. Its products include CareVISION, a
patient-centered clinical data repository and lifetime patient record system,
which is expected to constitute an integral component of TSI Transition IV
product. On December 3, 1998, TSI completed its acquisition of the remaining
capital stock of HealthVISION not already owned by TSI. See -- Subsequent
Events below.
In September 1997, TSI acquired all the outstanding shares of Vital
Software Inc. Vital, a privately held developer of products that automate
the clinical processes unique to medical oncology. The purchase price was
approximately $63 million, which was comprised of $27 million in cash and
252,003 shares of TSI common stock with a value of $36 million. The purchase
price was allocated entirely to purchased research and development. See Note 16
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of TSI.

FISCAL YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1998 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 1997
REVENUES. TSI total revenues decreased 14%, to $440 million in 1998
from $446 million in 1997. Software and implementation revenues decreased 85%
to $302 million in 1998, compared to $330 million in 1997. The decrease in
software and implementation revenue is primarily due to TSI failure to achieve
planned levels of new system bookings. New system bookings were adversely
impacted by an overall lengthening of the sales cycle. TSI believes the sales
cycle was adversely affected by Year 2000 problems in healthcare legacy systems,
which caused delays in the acquisition of new systems due to resource
constraints. In addition, consolidation among healthcare providers has caused a
lengthening of the purchasing cycle of most healthcare organizations due to
management shifts and more complex approval processes. Maintenance revenue grew
189% to $137 million in 1998, compared to $116 million in 1997, due to
continued growth in TSI installed base of customers.
COST OF REVENUES. Cost of software and implementation revenue increased
200% to $124 million or 409% of software and implementation revenue in
1998, from $103 million or 312% of software and implementation revenue in
1997. The increase is primarily due to costs associated with additional
implementation staff and professional consultants as well as increased royalty
costs for third-party software. Cost of maintenance revenue increased 34% to
$29 million or 214% of maintenance revenue in 1998 from $28 million or
246% of maintenance revenue in 1997. The increase in cost of maintenance
revenue is
20
primarily due to the increase in the number of technical support staff necessary
to support the growth in TSI installed base.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. Research and development expenses increased
530% to $59 million in 1998 from $39 million in 1997. Research and
development expenses as a percent of total revenue also increased to 135% in
1998, compared to 87% in 1997. The increase is primarily due to an increase in
staff and increased professional consulting expense to support new product
development, including Transition IV and Vital Oncology, without a corresponding
increase in revenue.
SALES AND MARKETING. Sales and marketing expenses increased 142% to $79
million in 1998, from $69 million in 1997. Sales and marketing expenses as a
percent of total revenue also increased to 180% in 1998 from 155% in 1997. The
increase in spending is primarily associated with the growth of the sales
organization and marketing programs to support the expanding product lines.
GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. General and administrative expenses decreased
165% to $32 million in 1998, from $39 million in 1997. General and
administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue also decreased to 74% in
1998 from 87% in 1997. The decrease in spending is primarily due to a reduction
in performance related compensation expenses during the year as a result of the
decrease in revenue.
ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. Acquired in-process research
and development expense for 1997 includes a charge for purchased research and
development of $63 million relating to the acquisition of Vital.
NET INTEREST INCOME. Net interest income increased to $32 million in 1998
from $25 million in 1997. The increase in net interest income is attributable
to the interest generated on higher cash balances during fiscal 1998.
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. TSI effective income tax rate decreased to
400% in 1998 from 589% in 1997. The decrease was primarily due to the effect
of the charge for in-process research and development associated with the
acquisition of Vital, which was not deductible for tax purposes in fiscal year
1997. No such charge occurred in 1998.
FISCAL YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1997 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 1996
REVENUES. TSI total revenues increased 300% to $446 million in 1997,
from $343 million in 1996. Software and implementation revenues grew 328% to
$330 million in 1997, compared to $249 million in 1996. The growth in software
and implementation revenue is primarily due to sales to new TSI customers,
increased consolidation among existing customers which resulted in the sale of
additional site licenses, and the expansion of TSI product line which resulted
in increased product sales to existing customers. Maintenance revenue grew 227%
to $115 million in 1997, compared to $94 million in 1996, due to continued
growth in TSI installed base of customers.
COST OF REVENUES. Cost of software and implementation revenue increased
405% to $103 million or 312% of software and implementation revenue in
1997, from $73 million or 295% of software and implementation revenue in
1996. The dollar increase is primarily due to costs associated with additional
implementation staff and professional consultants as well as increased royalty
costs for third-party software. Cost of maintenance revenue decreased 104% to
$28 million or 246% of maintenance revenue in 1997 from $32 million or
336% of maintenance revenue in 1996. The decrease in cost of maintenance
revenue is primarily due to the reduced technical support necessary on mature
products.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. Research and development expenses increased
170% to $39 million in 1997 from $33 million in 1996. The increase in
spending is primarily a result of organizational changes which resulted in a net
increase in the number of staff assigned to research and development roles.
Research and development expenses as a percent of total revenue decreased
slightly to 87% in 1997, compared to 97% in 1996. The decrease is primarily
due to increased productivity from investments in technologies made in prior
years and maturing of the core product lines. TSI expects that research and
development expenses will increase as a percentage of revenue in future periods
as new development projects are undertaken.
21
SALES AND MARKETING. Sales and marketing expenses increased 536% to $69
million in 1997, from $45 million in 1996. Sales and marketing expenses as a
percent of total revenue also increased to 155% in 1997 from 132% in 1996. The
increase in spending is primarily due to additional staff and marketing programs
as well as increased commission expense directly related to the growth in
revenue.
GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. General and administrative expenses increased
642% to $39 million in 1997, from $24 million in 1996. General and
administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue also increased to 87% in
1997 from 69% in 1996. The increase in spending is primarily due to
professional services and other costs associated with becoming a publicly traded
company as well as additional administrative expenses related to Enterprising
HealthCare, which was acquired in July 1996.
COMPENSATION CHARGE. In fiscal 1996 TSI incurred a compensation charge of
$30 million arising from its acquisition, in connection with the January 1996
Recapitalization, of shares of common stock issued to certain executive officers
pursuant to the exercise of options.
ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. Acquired in-process research
and development expense includes a charge for purchased research and development
of $63 million relating to the acquisition of Vital in September 1997.
NET INTEREST INCOME. Net interest income increased to $25 million in 1997
from $01 million in 1996. The increase in net interest income is primarily due
to the repayment out of the proceeds of TSI initial public offering in April
1996 of debt incurred in the January 1996 Recapitalization and interest earned
on cash balances generated from operations and the balance of the proceeds of
TSI initial public offering.
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. TSI effective income tax rate increased to
589% in 1997 from 406% in 1996, primarily due to the effect of the charge for
in-process research and development associated with the acquisition of Vital,
which is not deductible for tax purposes. The tax rate for 1997 without the
effect of the charge for in-process research and development was 397%.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
At September 30, 1998, TSI had cash and cash equivalents of $387 million
and short term investments of $273 million, an increase of $75 million from
the amount at September 30, 1997. The increase in cash and cash equivalents and
short term investments was comprised primarily of net cash provided by operating
activities of $100 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal
1998 was generated primarily from net income.
TSI has an unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of $15 million.
The credit facility contains covenants setting minimum net worth, maximum
leverage ratio and minimum net income requirements for TSI. There have been no
amounts drawn on this line. Advances under the revolving line of credit bear
interest, at TSI election, either at a base rate or at a eurodollar rate.
The base rate is a floating rate equal to the greater of a the prime rate or
b the federal funds effective rate plus one-half of one percent 50%. The
eurodollar rate is equal to the sum of x a rate determined by reference to the
then-current interbank offered rate for dollar-denominated eurodollar deposits,
with certain adjustments, plus y one percent 10%.
TSI believes available funds, cash generated from operations and its unused
line of credit of $15 million will be sufficient to finance TSI operations and
planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. There can be
no assurance, however, that TSI will not require additional financing during
that time or thereafter.
YEAR 2000 ISSUES
TSI software license agreements generally contain warranties concerning
the Year 2000 compliance of the licensed product. TSI has tested the products it
has developed internally and believes that, with the exception of its Transition
for Quality product for which TSI expects to release a fully Year 2000
compliant version in early 1999, the current release of each of its internally
developed products is Year 2000 compliant. TSI includes in its products certain
software licensed from third-party vendors. TSI has not yet completed its
22
evaluation of Year 2000 compliance of all such third-party software. For
example, TSI has not yet verified that Uniface, licensed from Compuware
Corporation, is Year 2000 compliant. In order to use TSI products customers
must themselves license software, including certain operating system and
database management system software, from third-party vendors such as Microsoft
Corporation and Oracle Corporation. Not all such third-party software may be
fully Year 2000 compliant. For example, Microsoft Corporation has not certified
that its Windows NT operating system is Year 2000 compliant. TSI has also
evaluated the Year 2000 compliance of its critical internal software systems,
including its financial, payroll and human resources systems and its telephone
switch, and believes, based in part on certification from the vendors of such
systems, that such systems are Year 2000 compliant. TSI does not expect to incur
material costs in completing its Year 2000 assessment and remediation program.
However, the discovery of previously undetected Year 2000 defects in TSI
products including those licensed from third-party vendors, in third-party
software required for customers to use TSI products or in its internal
software systems could damage TSI business. Also, apprehension in the
marketplace over Year 2000 compliance issues has led and may in the future lead
businesses, including customers of TSI, to defer significant capital investments
in information technology programs and software. They could elect to defer those
investments either because they decide to focus their capital budgets on the
expenditures necessary to bring their own existing systems into compliance or
because they wish to purchase only software with a proven ability to process
data after 1999.
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On October 29, 1998, TSI entered into the Merger Agreement pursuant to
which a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eclipsys will be merged into TSI, with TSI
becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eclipsys.
On December 3, 1998, TSI completed its acquisition of HealthVISION by
acquiring the approximately 805% of the outstanding capital stock of
HealthVISION not already owned by TSI for cash in the amount of $256 million
plus assumed liabilities of $93 million, net of cash acquired, plus an earn-out
of up to $108 million if specified financial milestones are met. The
acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase. HealthVISION total revenues
for the year ended December 31, 1997 and for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 1998, were approximately $92 million and $94 million,
respectively. HealthVISION incurred net losses of $111 million and $60 million
for such periods, respectively. At September 30, 1998, HealthVISION employed
approximately 150 persons in seven offices in the United States, Canada and
Australia.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income SFAS 130, which establishes standards for reporting and display of
comprehensive income and its components revenue, expenses, gains and losses in
a full set of general purpose financial statements. TSI will be required to
adopt the standard in the first quarter of its 1999 fiscal year, and does not
believe this statement will have a material effect on TSI financial position
or results of operations.
In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
No. 131 SFAS 131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information. Based on the management approach to segment reporting, SFAS No.
131 establishes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly
and to report entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major
customers and the countries in which the entity holds material assets and
reports material revenue. TSI will be required to adopt the standard in the
first quarter of its 1999 fiscal year, and does not believe this statement will
have a material effect on TSI financial disclosures.
In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133 SFAS 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for such
instruments. SFAS 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
1999. Currently, TSI has no such derivative holdings.
23
On October 27, 1997, the AICPA Accounting Standards Executive Committee
issued Statement of Position 97-2 SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition.
SOP 97-2 supersedes Statement of Position 91-1, Software Revenue Recognition,
and provides guidance on when and in what amounts revenue should be recognized
for the licensing, selling, leasing, or marketing of computer software. SOP 97-2
is effective for transactions beginning in the first quarter of TSI 1999
fiscal year. TSI is analyzing the impact of the SOP which may cause a deferral
of revenue.
