37 31 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of WESCO International, Inc. We have completed an integrated audit of WESCO International, Inc.s 2004 consolidated financial
statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004 and audits
of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below. Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under a 1present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of WESCO International,
Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under a 2
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in Managements Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A., that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004 based on criteria established
in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those
criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit
of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over
financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

The accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements. 36 Table of Contents WESCO INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION WESCO International, Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively, WESCO, headquartered in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is a full-line distributor of electrical supplies and equipment and is a
provider of integrated supply procurement services. WESCO currently operates approximately 350
branch locations and five distribution centers in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico,
Guam, the United Kingdom, Nigeria, United Arab Emirates and Singapore. On June5, 1998, WESCO repurchased and retired all of the common stock of WESCO principally
held by non-management shareholders for net consideration of approximately $6535million. In
addition, WESCO repaid approximately $3791million of then outstanding indebtedness, and sold
29,604,351 shares of common stock to an investor group led by affiliates of the Cypress Group LLC
Cypress representing approximately 887% of WESCO at that time for an aggregate cash
consideration of $3181million. Existing management retained approximately an 113% interest in
WESCO immediately following the transaction. As a result of the 113% retained ownership, the
transaction was treated as a recapitalization for financial reporting purposes and, accordingly,
the historical bases of WESCOs assets and liabilities were not affected. 2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of WESCO International, Inc. and
all of its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying
disclosures. Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events
and actions WESCO may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from the
estimates. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized when title, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer, or
services are rendered and evidence of a customer arrangement exists. In nearly all cases, this
occurs at the time of shipment from our distribution point, as the terms of nearly all of WESCOs
sales are FOB shipping point. Additionally, the sales price to our customer is fixed or is
determinable and we have reasonable assurance as to the collectibility of the sale in accordance
with Staff Accounting Bulletin No104. Gross Profit Our calculation of gross profit is net sales less cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold
include our cost of the products sold and excludes cost for selling, general and administrative
expenses and depreciation and amortization which are reported separately in the statement of
income. Supplier Volume Rebates WESCO receives rebates from certain suppliers based on contractual arrangements with such
suppliers. An asset, included within other accounts receivable on the balance sheet, represents
the estimated amounts due to WESCO under the rebate provisions of such contracts. The
corresponding rebate income is recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold. The appropriate
level of such income is derived from the level of actual purchases made by WESCO from suppliers, in
accordance with the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF Issue No02- 16, Accounting by a Reseller for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor.
Receivables under the supplier rebate program are within other accounts receivable and was $268million
at December31, 2004 and $156million at December31, 2003. The total amount recorded as a
reduction to cost of goods sold was $445million, $293million and $247million for 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. 37 Table of Contents Shipping and Handling Costs and Fees WESCO records the majority of costs and fees associated with transporting its products to
customers as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs totaled
$366million, $362million and $372million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The remaining shipping and handling costs relate to costs that are billed to our customers.
These costs and the related revenue are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of
operations. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are defined as highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90days
or less when purchased. As of December31, 2004, cash and cash equivalents were $345million, an
increase of $70million from December31, 2003. Asset Securitization WESCO accounts for the securitization of accounts receivable in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. At the time the receivables are sold, the
balances are removed from the balance sheet. SFAS No140 also requires retained interests in the
transferred assets to be measured by allocating the previous carrying amount between the assets
sold and retained interests based on their relative fair values at the date of transfer. WESCO
estimates fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at a rate
commensurate with the risks involved. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts WESCO maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of its customers to make required payments. WESCO has a systematic procedure using
estimates based on historical data and reasonable assumptions of collectibility made at the local
branch level and on a consolidated corporate basis to calculate the allowance for doubtful
accounts. If the financial condition of WESCOs customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an
impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The allowance
for doubtful accounts was $125million at December31, 2004 and $114million at December31,
2003,respectively. The total amount recorded as selling, general and administrative expense
related to bad debts was $58million, $102million and $90million for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Inventories Inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale and are stated at the lower
of cost or market. Cost is determined principally under the average cost method. WESCO makes
provisions for obsolete or slow-moving inventories as necessary to reflect reduction in inventory
value. Reserves for excess and obsolete inventories were $101million and $98million at
December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The valuation allowance for excess and obsolete
inventories was $101million at December31, 2004 and $98million at December31, 2003. The
total expense related to excess and obsolete inventories, included in cost of goods sold, was $55
million, $50million and $55million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Property, Buildings and Equipment Property, buildings and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation expense is determined
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over either their respective lease terms or their estimated lives,
whichever is shorter. Estimated useful lives range from five to forty years for buildings and
leasehold improvements, and three to seven years for furniture, fixtures and equipment. 38 Table of Contents Computer software is accounted for in accordance with Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. Capitalized computer
software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life,
typically two to five years, and are reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable
value. Expenditures for new facilities and improvements that extend the useful life of an asset are
capitalized. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When property is retired
or otherwise disposed of, the cost and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts and any related gains or losses are recorded and reported as selling, general and
administrative expenses. Goodwill Effective January1, 2002, WESCO adopted SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Under SFAS No142, goodwill is no longer amortized, but is reduced if it is found to be impaired.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events
or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. This process involves
estimating fair value using discounted cash flow analyses. Considerable management judgment is
necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows. Assumptions used for these estimated cash
flows were based on a combination of historical results and current internal forecasts. Two
primary assumptions were an average long-term revenue growth rate of 4% and an average discount
rate of 8%. We cannot predict certain events that could adversely affect the reported value of
goodwill, which totaled $4016million at December31, 2004 and $3987million at December31,
2003. Insurance Programs We use commercial insurance for auto, workers compensation, casualty and health claims as a
risk reduction strategy to minimize catastrophic losses. Our strategy involves large deductibles
where we must pay all costs up to the deductible amount. We estimate our reserve based on
historical incident rates and costs. The assumptions included in developing this accrual include
the period of time from incurrence of a medical claim until the claim is paid by the insurance
provider. Presently, this period is estimated to be eight weeks. The total liability related to
the insurance programs was $67million at December31, 2004 and $69million at December31, 2003. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of
assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect
when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances, if any, are provided when a
portion or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized. Foreign Currency Translation The local currency is the functional currency for all of WESCOs operations outside the United
States. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange
rate in effect at the end of each period. Income statement accounts are translated at the average
exchange rate prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments arising from the use of
differing exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of other comprehensive
income within stockholders equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are
included in net income for the period. Treasury-Stock Common stock purchased for treasury is recorded at cost. At the date of subsequent reissue,
the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock, with cost determined on a weighted
average basis. Stock Based Compensation During the year ended December31, 2003, WESCO adopted the measurement provisions of SFAS No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. This change in accounting method was applied on a
prospective basis in accordance with SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and
Disclosure an amendment of SFAS No123. Stock options awarded prior to 2003 are accounted for
under the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees. WESCO recognized $29million and $06million of compensation expense
related to equity awards in the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 39 Table of Contents The following table presents the pro forma results as if the fair-value-based method of

The weighted average fair value per equity award granted was $1384, $400 and $457 for the
years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. For purposes of presenting pro forma results, the fair value of each option grant is estimated
on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following weighted

Fair Value of Financial Instruments For certain of WESCOs financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying values approximate fair
value due to their short maturities. WESCOs senior subordinated notes with an aggregate principal
amount of $3235million were issued at an average discount of 2% and were trading at a premium of
3% $3340million at December31, 2004. The Bruckner note was issued in 2004 with a principal
amount of $500million $30million payable in 2005 and $20million payable in 2006 and carries a
fixed rate of interest of 10% that approximates our estimated fair value under our senior notes. Interest Rate Swap Agreements WESCO enters into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the exposure of its debt to interest
rate risk and formally documents this strategy as part of its risk management program. Interest
rate swaps are used to modify the market risk exposures for a portion of WESCOs debt to achieve
LIBOR-based floating interest expense. The swap transactions generally involve the exchange of
fixed-to-floating interest payment obligations and are accounted for as fair value hedges. The
gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged
item, is recognized in earnings in the current period. WESCO estimates the fair value of derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models
using current market rates, and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. At
December31, 2004, the net fair value of outstanding interest rate derivatives designated as fair
value hedges was a liability of $05million. At December31, 2003, the net fair value of
outstanding interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges was an asset of $01million.
Cash flows from derivative instruments are presented in a manner consistent with the underlying
transaction. 40 Table of Contents Environmental Expenditures WESCO has facilities and operations that distribute certain products that must comply with
environmental regulations and laws. Expenditures for current operations are expensed or
capitalized, as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past
operations, and which do not contribute to future revenue, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded
when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No46 revised December2003, Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities. This interpretation requires unconsolidated variable interest
entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively
disperse the risk and rewards of ownership among their owners and other parties involved. This
interpretation, as amended, is effective for all entities subject to this interpretation no later
than the end of the first period that ends after March15, 2004. The adoption of this
interpretation did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In September2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue No04-10, Applying Paragraph19 of FASB
Statement No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, in
Determining Whether to Aggregate Operating Segments That Do Not Meet the Quantitative Thresholds.
EITF Issue No04-10 establishes evaluation criteria for an enterprise to use when determining
whether operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds can still be aggregated in
accordance with paragraph 19 of SFAS No131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information. We have evaluated EITF Issue No04-10 and have determined that it has no
impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No123R,
Share-Based Payment. This statement is a revision of SFAS Statement No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and its related implementation guidance. SFAS 123R addresses all forms of share-based
payment SBP awards including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options,
restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. Under SFAS 123R, SBP awards result in a cost that
will be measured at fair value on the awards grant date, based on the estimated number of awards
that are expected to vest and will be reflected as compensation expense in the financial
statements. In addition, this statement will apply to unvested options granted prior to the
effective date. This new standard is effective in interim and annual reporting periods that begin
after June15, 2005. WESCO is currently evaluating the effect that implementation of the new
standard will have on its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 3. GOODWILL During the fourth quarter of 2004, WESCO completed its annual impairment review required by
SFAS No142. Each of WESCOs eight reporting units was tested for impairment by comparing the
implied fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value using discounted cash flow
analyses. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows.
Assumptions used for these estimated cash flows were based on a combination of historical results
and current internal forecasts. No impairment losses were identified as a result of this review. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows

41 Table of Contents 4. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION WESCO maintains an accounts receivable securitization program Receivables Facility that
was amended and had its availability increased to $325million
in August2004. The facility provides for a $190million purchase commitment with a term of 364days and a $135million purchase commitment
with a term of three years. Under the Receivables Facility, WESCO sells, on a continuous basis, an
undivided interest in all domestic accounts receivable to WESCO Receivables Corp., a wholly owned,
special purpose entity SPE. The SPE sells, without recourse to a third-party conduit all the
eligible receivables while maintaining a subordinated interest, in the form of
overcollateralization, in a portion of the receivables. WESCO has agreed to continue servicing the
sold receivables for the financial institution at market rates; accordingly, no servicing asset or
liability has been recorded. As of December31, 2004 and 2003, securitized accounts receivable totaled approximately $420
million and $330million, respectively, of which the subordinated retained interest was
approximately $212million and $105million, respectively. Accordingly, approximately $208million
and $225million of accounts receivable balances were removed from the consolidated balance sheets
at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. WESCO reduced its Receivables Facility by $170
million in 2004 and by $680million in 2003. Costs associated with the Receivables Facility
totaled $66million, $45million and $66million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These
amounts are recorded as other expenses in the consolidated statements of income and are primarily
related to the discount and loss on the sale of accounts receivables, partially offset by related
servicing revenue. The key economic assumptions used to measure the retained interest at the date of the
securitization for securitizations completed in 2004 were a discount rate of 3% and an estimated
life of 15months. At December31, 2004, an immediate adverse change in the discount rate or
estimated life of 10% and 20% would result in a reduction in the fair value of the retained
interest of approximately $02million and $03million, respectively. These sensitivities are
hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the figures indicate, changes in fair value based
on a 10% variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the
change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in this example, the
effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is
calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in
changes in another. 5. ACQUISITIONS The following table sets forth the consideration paid for acquisitions

In 1998, WESCO acquired substantially all the assets and assumed substantially all liabilities
and obligations relating to the operations of Bruckner Supply Company, Inc. Bruckner. The terms
of the purchase agreement provide for additional contingent consideration to be paid based on
achieving certain earnings targets. The amount of earnout proceeds payable in any single year
subsequent to achieving the earnings target is capped under this agreement at $30million per year.
As a result of Bruckners performance in 2003, WESCO recorded a liability of $80million as of
December31, 2003 for contingent consideration relating to the Bruckner agreement. In June2004,
WESCO paid $30million pursuant to this agreement, and the remaining $50million, including
interest at a fixed rate of 10% due under the agreement, was converted into a note payable $30
million, due in June2005, classified as current, and $20million, due in June2006, classified as
long-term debt. No additional amounts can be earned under this agreement. Certain other acquisitions also contain contingent consideration provisions, only one of which
could require a significant payment. Management estimates this payment could range up to $17
million and would be made in multiple payments between 2005 and 2008. A payment of $30million
reduced for acquisition related expenses of $10million was paid in the fourth quarter of 2004
related to this acquisition. 42 Table of Contents 6. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK AND SIGNIFICANT SUPPLIERS WESCO distributes its products and services and extends credit to a large number of customers
in the industrial, construction, utility and manufactured structures markets. In addition, one
supplier accounted for approximately 12%, 13% and 13% of WESCOs purchases for each of the three
years, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 7. PROPERTY, BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT The following table sets forth the components of property, buildings and equipment

Net of original issue discount of $4,934 and $6,459 and purchase discount of $3,914
and $5,930 in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and of interest rate swaps of $2,669 and $4,165
in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Revolving Credit Facility In March2002, WESCO Distribution, Inc. entered into a $290million revolving credit agreement
Revolving Credit Facility that is collateralized by substantially all inventory owned by WESCO
and also by the accounts receivable of WESCO Distribution Canada, Inc. Availability under the
agreement, which matures in 2007, is limited to the amount of eligible inventory and Canadian
receivables applied against certain advance rates. We are permitted to borrow and repay under the
facility on a daily basis. Interest on the Revolving Credit Facility is at LIBOR plus a margin
that will range from 20% to 275% depending upon the amount of excess availability under the
facility. As long as the average daily excess availability for both the preceding and projected
succeeding 90-day period is greater than $50million, WESCO would be permitted to make acquisitions
and repurchase outstanding public stock and bonds. 43 Table of Contents The above permitted transactions would also be allowed if such excess availability is between
$25million and $50million and WESCOs fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined by the agreement,
is at least 125 to 10 after taking into consideration the permitted transaction. Additionally,
if WESCOs excess availability under the agreement is less than $50million, WESCO must maintain a
fixed charge coverage ratio of 11 to 10. During 2003, an amendment was executed that reduced the size of the Revolving Credit Facility
to $200million. WESCO recorded a $08million charge associated with the write-off of deferred
financing fees related to this reduction. At December31, 2004 and 2003, there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility and
approximately $172million and $178million, respectively, in availability. During 2004 and 2003
WESCO borrowed and repaid the line of credit as needed to support the financing of our operations.
At December31, 2004, the interest rate was 42%. Mortgage Financing Facility In February2003, WESCO finalized a $51million mortgage financing facility, $13million of
which was outstanding as of December31, 2002. Borrowings under the mortgage financing are
collateralized by 75 domestic properties and are subject to a 22-year amortization schedule with a
balloon payment due at the end of the 10-year term. Proceeds from the borrowings were used to
reduce outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Interest rates on borrowings
under this facility are fixed at 65%. Senior Subordinated Notes In June1998 and August2001, WESCO Distribution, Inc. completed an offering of $300million
and $100million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due on
June1, 2008. The notes were issued at an average issue price of 98% of par. The net proceeds
received from the notes were approximately $376million. The net proceeds were used to repay
outstanding indebtedness. The senior subordinated notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed
by WESCO International, Inc. During 2004 and 2003, WESCO repurchased $553million and $212million in aggregate principal
amount of senior subordinated notes, respectively. WESCO recorded a net loss of $26million in
2004 and a net gain of $06million in 2003. As of December31, 2004, WESCO had outstanding $3235
million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due in 2008. The senior subordinated notes bear interest at a stated rate of 9125% payable semi-annually
on June 1 and December 1 through June1, 2008. The effective interest rate for the senior
subordinated notes is 94%. The senior subordinated notes are redeemable at the option of WESCO Distribution, Inc., in
whole or in part, at any time after June1, 2003 at the following prices on the June anniversary

The noteholders have the right to require WESCO Distribution, Inc., upon a change of control,
to repurchase all or any part of the senior subordinated notes at a redemption price equal to 101%
of the principal amount provided, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In September and October2001, WESCO entered into four separate fixed-to-floating interest
rate swap agreements, each with a notional amount of $25million. In June2003, these agreements
were called by the issuer and as a result WESCO received a $46million payment. The gain
resulting from the settlement of these agreements has been deferred and is being amortized as a
reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the senior subordinated notes. During
2004 and 2003, interest expense was reduced due to amortization of the gain by $09million and
$05million, respectively. 44 Table of Contents In September2003, WESCO entered into a $50million interest rate swap agreement. In December
2003, WESCO entered into two additional $25million interest rate swap agreements. These
agreements had terms expiring concurrently with the 9125% senior subordinated notes with the
intent of converting $100million of the senior subordinated notes to variable rates of interest.
Pursuant to these agreements, WESCO receives semi-annual fixed interest payments at the rate of
9125% and will make semi-annual variable interest payments at rates based on six-month LIBOR plus
a premium in arrears. The LIBOR rates in the agreements reset every six months. These agreements
can be terminated by the counter party in accordance with a redemption schedule that is consistent
with the redemption schedule for the senior subordinated notes. Other At December31, 2004 and 2003, other borrowings primarily consisted of vehicle capital leases
and notes issued to sellers in connection with acquisitions. The following table sets forth the aggregate principal repayment requirements for all
indebtedness for the next five years and thereafter in thousands

WESCOs credit agreements contain various restrictive covenants that, among other things,
impose limitations on idividend payments or certain other restricted payments or investments;
iithe incurrence of additional indebtedness and guarantees or issuance of additional stock;
iiicreation of liens; ivmergers, consolidation or sales of substantially all of WESCOs
assets; vcertain transactions among affiliates; vipayments by certain subsidiaries to WESCO;
and viicapital expenditures. In addition, the revolving credit agreement requires WESCO to meet
certain fixed charge coverage tests depending on availability. WESCO is permitted to pay dividends under certain limited circumstances. At December31, 2004
and 2003, no dividends had been declared, and therefore no retained earnings were reserved for
dividend payments. WESCO had $249million and $144million of outstanding letters of credit at December31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. These letters of credit are used as collateral for interest rate swap
agreements, potential obligation under insurance programs as well as certain foreign commercial
transactions. The fair value of the letters of credit approximates the contract value. Bruckner Note Payable In 2004, we paid $30million pursuant to the Bruckner purchase agreement and converted the
remaining amount due into a $50million note payable $30million due in June2005, classified as
current debt, and $20million, due in June2006, classified as long-term debt with interest at
10%. 9. CAPITAL STOCK Preferred Stock There are 20million shares of preferred stock authorized at a par value of $01 per share.
The Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue all
authorized preferred shares in one or more series and to fix the number of shares, designations,
voting powers, preferences, optional and other special rights and the restrictions or
qualifications thereof. The rights, preferences, privileges and powers of each series of preferred
stock may differ with respect to dividend rates, liquidation values, voting rights, conversion
rights, redemption provisions and other matters. 45 Table of Contents Common Stock There are 210million shares of common stock and 20million shares of ClassB common stock
authorized at a par value of $01 per share. The ClassB common stock is identical to the common
stock, except for voting and conversion rights. The holders of ClassB common stock have no voting
rights. With certain exceptions, ClassB common stock may be converted, at the option of the
holder, into the same number of shares of common stock. The following table sets forth capital stock share activity

In November2003, WESCOs board of directors authorized a special repurchase of WESCOs Class
B common stock. Pursuant to the authorization, 43million shares of ClassB common stock were
repurchased from an institutional holder, at a discount to market, for approximately $273million.
Prior to the repurchase, 03million ClassB shares were converted to 03million shares of common
stock when they were sold on the secondary markets by the institutional holder. At December31,
2004, all the shares of ClassB common stock were held in treasury or had been converted to common
stock. In December2004,WESCO completed a public offering of 40million shares of its common stock.
Certain selling stockholders offered an additional 71million shares of common stock. The net
proceeds to WESCO of approximately $996million after deducting the underwriting discounts and
offering expenses were designated to be used to repurchase a portion of WESCOs senior subordinated
notes. 10. INCOME TAXES The following table sets forth the components of the provision for income taxes

Represents the recognition of a $06million benefit associated with the utilization
of a net operating loss. As of December31, 2004 and 2003, WESCO had state tax benefits derived from net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $134million $87million, net of federal income tax and $128
million $83million, net of federal income tax, respectively. The amounts will begin expiring
in 2006. The realization of these state deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if
any, and the timing and amount are uncertain. Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been
fully offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance increased by approximately $04
million in 2004 and $17million in 2003. Utilization of WESCOs state net operating loss carryforwards is subject to a substantial
annual limitation imposed by state statute. Such an annual limitation could result in the
expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization. 47 Table of Contents The following table sets forth deferred tax assets and liabilities

shares outstanding during the periods. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net
income by the weighted average common shares and common share equivalents outstanding during the
periods. The dilutive effect of common share equivalents is considered in the diluted earnings per
share computation using the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the details of basic and diluted earnings per share

exercise price of $924 per share were outstanding as of December31, 2003 were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share because the option exercise prices were greater than the
average market price of WESCO common stock. 12. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS A majority of WESCOs employees are covered by defined contribution retirement savings plans
for their service rendered subsequent to WESCOs formation. U.S. employee contributions of not
more than 6% of eligible compensation are matched 50% by WESCO. WESCOs contributions for Canadian
employees range from 1% to 6% of eligible compensation based on years of service. For the years
ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, WESCO contributed $150million, $95million and $49
million, respectively, which was charged to expense. Contributions are made in cash to employee retirement savings plan accounts. Employees then
have the option to transfer into any of their core investment options including WESCO stock. 48 Table of Contents In addition, employer contributions may be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors
and can be based on WESCOs financial performance. Discretionary employer contributions of
approximately $88million and $42million are included in the total contributions of $151
million and $95million for 2004 and 2003, respectively. No such contributions were made during
2002. 13. STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS Stock Purchase Plans In connection with the 1998 recapitalization, WESCO established a stock purchase plan 1998
Stock Purchase Plan under which certain employees may be granted an opportunity to purchase
WESCOs common stock. The maximum number of shares available for purchase may not exceed 427,720.
There were no shares issued in 2004, 2003 or 2002. Stock Option Plans WESCO has sponsored four stock option plans, the 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the
1998 Stock Option Plan, the Stock Option Plan for Branch Employees and the 1994 Stock Option Plan.
The LTIP was designed to be the successor plan to all prior plans. Outstanding options under prior
plans will continue to be governed by their existing terms, which are substantially similar to the
LTIP. Any remaining shares reserved for future issuance under the prior plans are available for
issuance under the LTIP. The LTIP is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors. An initial reserve of 6,936,000 shares of common stock has been authorized for issuance under
the LTIP. This reserve automatically increases by ithe number of shares of common stock covered
by unexercised options granted under prior plans that are canceled or terminated after the
effective date of the LTIP and iithe number of shares of common stock surrendered by employees
to pay the exercise price and/or minimum withholding taxes in connection with the exercise of stock
options granted under our prior plans. Options granted vest and become exercisable once criteria based on time or financial
performance are achieved. If the financial performance criteria are not met, all the options will
vest after nine years and nine months. All options vest immediately in the event of a change in
control. Each option terminates on the tenth anniversary of its grant date unless terminated
sooner under certain conditions. During December2003, in a privately negotiated transaction with 19 employees, WESCO redeemed
the net equity value of stock options originally granted in 1994 and 1995, representing
approximately 29million shares. The options held by the employees had a weighted average price
of $175. The options were redeemed at a price of $863 per share. The cash payment of $201
million was made in January2004. WESCO recognized a tax benefit of $73million as a result of
this transaction. In September2004, WESCO granted 875,500 stock-settled stock appreciation rights at an
exercise price of $2402. None of these awards were cancelled in 2004 and none were exercisable at
December31, 2004. All awards under WESCOs stock incentive plans are designed to be issued at fair market value. As of December31, 2004, 50million shares of common stock were reserved under the LTIP for
future equity award grants. 49 Table of Contents The following table sets forth a summary of both stock options and stock appreciation rights

Rental expense for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, was $330million, $323
million and $329million, respectively. WESCO has litigation arising from time to time in the normal course of business. In
managements opinion, any present litigation WESCO is aware of will not materially affect WESCOs
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In 2003, we reached a final settlement agreement related to an employment and wages claim with
the case being dismissed with prejudice. We settled the case for $34million and received a
refund of approximately $300,000 of that amount. 50 Table of Contents 15. SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION WESCO is engaged principally in one line of business the sale of electrical products and
maintenance repair and operating supplies which represents more than 90% of the consolidated net
sales, income from operations and assets for 2004, 2003 and 2002. WESCO has over 200,000 product
stock keeping units and markets over 1,000,000 for customers. It is impractical to disclose net
sales by product, major product group or service group. There were no material amounts of sales or
transfers among geographic areas and no material amounts of export sales. The following table sets forth information about WESCO by geographic area

controls and procedures as such term is defined under Rule13a-15e promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our
principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure

financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on our evaluation
under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2004. Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. Item9B. Other Information. None. 56 Table of Contents PART III
