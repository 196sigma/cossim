HALL, KINION & ASSOCIATES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 27, 1998, DECEMBER 28, 1997 AND DECEMBER 29, 1996
Note 1. Business and Significant Accounting Policies
Business. Hall, Kinion & Associates, Inc. the Company is an information
technology staffing company specializing in placing high technology personnel
on both a contract and permanent basis. During 1998 the Company acquired
certain assets from Group-IPEX, purchased all assets from TKO Personnel, Inc.
TKO, and certain assets from Alexander, Bohemer & Tomasco, dba, The
Huntington Group, Huntington and Interactive Technology Consultants, LLC,
ITC. In December 1996, the Company acquired certain assets of
TeamAllianceTechnology Partners, L.P. Note 2.
Initial Public Offering. In August 1997, the Company completed its initial
public offering of its common stock. Of the 2,892,250 shares of common stock
offered, 1,666,667 shares were sold by the Company and 1,225,583 shares were
sold by selling stockholders. The Company received approximately $215 million
of cash, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and other expenses.
Simultaneously, all outstanding shares of preferred stock were automatically
converted into an equal number of shares of common stock.
Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such management
estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and certain
accruals. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The Company operates in a dynamic industry, and accordingly, can be
affected by a variety of factors. For example, management of the Company
believes that changes in any of the following areas could have a negative
effect on the Company in terms of its future financial position and results of
operations: ability to obtain additional financing, regulatory changes,
uncertainty relating to the performance of the U.S. economy, competition,
demand for the Company services, litigation or other claims against the
Company, and the hiring, training and retention of key employees.
The Company financial instruments that are exposed to credit risk are
primarily cash and equivalents, investments and accounts receivable. The
Company places its cash with what it believes are high credit quality
financial institutions. In granting credit, the Company routinely evaluates
the financial strength of its customers.
Cash and Equivalents. The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash
equivalents, consisting primarily of money market funds and bank accounts, are
stated at a cost which approximates fair value.
Investments. Investments consist of high quality money market instruments
with original maturities greater than 90 days, but less than one year, and are
stated at fair value. At December 27, 1998, the Company investments are all
classified as available for sale. Unrealized gains and losses on securities
classified as available-for-sale were not significant.
Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost and
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, generally three to twenty-five years. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease
term.
23
HALL, KINION & ASSOCIATES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
Goodwill. Goodwill representing the cost in excess of the fair value of net
assets acquired related to acquisitions is being amortized on a straight-line
basis over 5 to 40 years. For the years ended December 27, 1998, December 28,
1997, and December 29, 1996 amortization expense was $561,000, $304,000, and
$25,000 respectively. The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill on
a quarterly basis based upon estimated future cash flows.
Revenue Recognition. Revenue from contract placements is recognized as
services are performed. Revenue from permanent placements is recognized upon
commencement of employment.
Other Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses include certain non-
recurring charges including litigation settlement and related costs and
severance costs.
Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach of accounting for income
taxes.
Stock-Based Compensation. The Company accounts for stock-based awards to
employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.
Net Income Per Share. Basic net income per share excludes dilution and is
computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the
weighted average of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net
income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or
converted into common stock.
A reconciliation of basic weighted average common stock shares to diluted
weighted average common shares follows:

Fiscal Year. The Company fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to
December 31. Fiscal years 1998, 1997, and 1996 all consisted of 52 weeks.
New Accounting Pronouncement. In June 1998, the Financial Accounting
Standard Board adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts and for hedging activities. It requires that an entity
recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of
financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. The Company
has not yet determined the effect, if any, that adoption of SFAS No. 133 will
have on the Company consolidated financial position, results of operations
or cash flows. The statement is effective for fiscal quarters beginning after
June 15, 1999, and should not be applied retroactively to financial statements
of prior periods.

Note 2. Acquisitions
In November 1998, the Company acquired the assets of Alexander, Boehmer,
Tomasco, LLC, doing business as Huntington Group HG and Interactive
Technologies Consultants ITC, for an aggregate of $89 million consisting of
a cash payment of $81 million and assumed net liabilities of $800,000. The
Huntington Group is a retainer-based executive research firm while ITC is a
provider of IT professionals on a contract basis. Both companies are located
in Trumbull, Connecticut.
Had the acquisitions of Huntington and ITC been completed at the beginning
of 1998, the Company unaudited pro forma revenues, net income and basic and
diluted earnings per share for 1998 would have been approximately
$130,400,000, $4,652,000, $049, and $045. Pro forma adjustments reflect
interest on the cash paid in the acquisition and the amortization of goodwill.
In August 1998, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of TKO
Personnel, Inc. for $913,000 consisting of a cash payment of $228,000 and
assumed net liabilities of $685,000. TKO Personnel, Inc. based in San Jose,
California, is an international permanent placement recruiting organization
for IT research and development professionals focusing on recruiting primarily
for Japan, but also from China and Korea.
In January 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all
of the assets of Group-IPEX an international recruiting organization for
information technology IT research and development professionals. Group IPEX
focuses on recruiting international IT professionals primarily from India but
also from Russia and China. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase.
Total consideration for this purchase was $7,339,000 including approximately
$250,000 of costs attributable to the acquisition. Terms of the acquisition
included cash payment of $6,175,000 at the date of acquisition and the
issuance of 46,000 shares of the Company Common stock valued at $914,000. In
addition, if certain revenue targets as defined, are achieved, the Company has
agreed to pay the sellers an aggregate of $3,375,000 in three future annual
installments as follows: May 10, 1999 1,125,000; May 10, 2000 1,125,000;
and May 10, 2001 1,125,000. The 1999 targets were substantially met and the
corresponding payment will be made in the month of May.
Had the acquisition of Group-IPEX been completed at the beginning of 1997,
the Company unaudited pro forma revenues, net income and basic and diluted
earnings per share for 1997 would have been approximately $100,077,000 2,388,000, $032, and $024. Pro forma adjustments reflect interest on the
cash paid in the acquisition and the amortization of goodwill as well as the
dilution attributable to the shares issued.
In December 1996, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets
of TeamAlliance Technology Partners, L.P. and its related limited liability
companies TeamAlliance, a provider of staffing services to information
technology companies. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. The
1996 consolidated financial statements of the Company include only the results
of operations of TeamAlliance for the month of December 1996. The total
consideration for this purchase was $9,424,000 including $949,000 of costs
attributable to the acquisition. Terms of the acquisition included a cash
payment of $4,168,000 at the date of acquisition and the issuance of 52,000
shares of Company common stock valued at $260,000. In 1997, the Company paid
the sellers $1,250,000 and $502,000 for the limited liability companies.
Additional payments to the sellers total $2,950,000 due in two future annual
installments as follows: October 31, 1998-$1,250,000 and October 31, 1999 1,700,000. In 1998 the Company paid off the note for a cash payment of $26
million.
Had the acquisition of TeamAlliance been completed at the beginning of
1996, the Company unaudited pro forma revenues, net income and basic and
diluted earnings per share for 1996 could have been approximately $65,091,000 475,000 and $008 and $006. Pro forma adjustments reflect the elimination of
TeamAlliance revenues for offices not acquired by the Company, the interest on
the cash paid in the acquisition and the amortization of goodwill as well as
the dilution attributable to the shares issued and stock options granted.

Note 4. Debt
The Company has a revolving line of credit facility enabling the Company to
borrow a stated percentage of eligible accounts receivable up to a maximum of
$15,000,000. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at the bank prime
rate 85% at December 28, 1997. Borrowings under this facility are
collaterized by substantially all of the assets of the Company. At December
27, 1998, the Company had $1,000,000 outstanding under the revolving line of
credit. The terms of the current portion of debt are as follows; $500,000 at a
rate of 65% due February 1999, $500,00 at the rate of 631% due May 1999, and
$2,000,000 at the rate of 525% due November, 1999.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-
Based Compensation, SFAS 123 requires the disclosure of pro forma net income
and earnings per share had the Company adopted the fair value method as of the
beginning of fiscal 1995. Under SFAS 123, the fair value of stock-based awards
to employees is calculated through the use of option price models, even though
models were developed to estimate the fair value of freely tradable, fully
transferable options without vesting restrictions, which significantly differ
from the Company stock option awards. These models also require subjective
assumptions, including future stock price volatility and expected time to
exercise, which affect the calculated values.
The Company calculations were made using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model with the following average assumptions: expected life, 12 months
following vesting; volatility, 372% after the initial public offering on
August 4, 1997 and zero before that date; risk free interest rates, 65% in
1998, 62% in 1997 and 65% in 1996; and no dividends during the expected
term.
The Company calculations are based on a multiple option valuation
approach and forfeitures are recognized as they occur. If the computed fair
value of the 1998, 1997 and 1996 awards had been amortized to expense over the
vesting period of the awards, pro forma net income and pro forma diluted net
income per share would have been $3,278,000, $032 per share, $1,764,000 018 per share and $1,087,000, $012 per share, in 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively.
